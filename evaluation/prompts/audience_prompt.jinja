You are a curriculum specialist asked to review a curriculum.

Your task is to identify the ideal audience for the proposed course (or set of courses).

Here is the curriculum:

<curriculum>
{{curriculum}}
</curriculum>

Now please describe the ideal audience for this content. Be specific. Don't provide a long list, instead of target it.

Examples:
"This is for a general business audience who needs to learn how to do basic financial analysis."
"This is for experienced programmers who have programmed in other languages but are switching to Python for the first time."
"This is for new managers or aspiring managers at large enterprises."
