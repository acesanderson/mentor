 \\n Which of these competencies would you find most valuable  \\n at your organization right now?  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2401065\",\"duration\":224,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Business analysis as a research discipline\",\"fileName\":\"2869051_01_04_LA30_research\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"This video covers why business analysis is considered a research discipline.

Think about how a bicycle or a car evolved over the years.  \\n Both were iterative and incremental  \\n in how they got to their current state.  \\n And both will continue to evolve.  \\n The relationship between elicitation  \\n and analysis is often a little bit of a mystery,  \\n and also involves elements of iterations and increments.  \\n In fact, I see a lot of teams acting  \\n and thinking like it's more of a phase,  \\n thinking that elicitation comes first in a phase  \\n and then analysis.  \\n And this really can't be further from the truth.  \\n What really happens is that we elicit  \\n to have something to analyze.  \\n And we analyze to know what more to elicit  \\n and determine what still needs to be discovered.  \\n This cycle continues until we feel  \\n like we have enough information  \\n to get started in delivering value.  \\n We want to make sure that this cycle of elicit  \\n and analyze is done in a highly collaborative way,  \\n using a variety of techniques  \\n to encourage dialogue, analysis and thinking in others.  \\n Some alone time yourself also helps along the way.  \\n Many teams fall into the trap of reviewing documents  \\n or texts in a tool to get approval  \\n without really doing any real elicitation or analysis.  \\n Text-based requirements reviews  \\n don't encourage the team to truly analyze or innovate.  \\n Text-based documentation can easily nudge the team  \\n into skipping the true essence of elicitation and analysis.  \\n So make sure that in the rush to document and approve,  \\n that elicitation, collaboration and analysis is not missed.  \\n I find that elicitation and analysis often happens  \\n at the same time in the same meeting,  \\n or in the same interaction points,  \\n meaning that some of the techniques we use to elicit  \\n are also used to analyze.  \\n For example, when interviewing a stakeholder,  \\n I ask questions to elicit.  \\n And while listening, I connect some pieces  \\n that cause me to ask more questions.  \\n Asking questions is eliciting,  \\n and connecting the pieces  \\n and discovering more questions is analysis.  \\n So for example, if I ask questions  \\n about a process, and then I do a process model,  \\n I eliciting by asking questions,  \\n and then I'm analyzing by doing the process model.  \\n Through the process model work that I do, I'm analyzing,  \\n and I'm likely going to come up with more questions  \\n to go back and elicit more information.  \\n Then I model and analyze again, and so forth.  \\n This is the iterative nature of elicitation and analysis.  \\n Elicitation and analysis also require planning.  \\n We need to consciously be aware  \\n of the techniques we plan to use and are using.  \\n We also need to adapt quickly  \\n if one of them isn't working.  \\n Great techniques make all the difference.  \\n When you are using the right technique  \\n to elicit and analyze,  \\n your stakeholders are having fun together.  \\n Everyone is learning and evolving their thoughts.  \\n The team is empowered to be innovative  \\n and serve the organization and the customer.  \\n The right techniques to elicit and analyze  \\n bring powerful dialogue to the team,  \\n insightful innovation and less rework overall.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2419079\",\"duration\":185,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Levels of detail in elicitation and analysis\",\"fileName\":\"580635_01_05_MM30_Levels_2021Q1\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, walk through the elicitation and analysis layers and explore how to progressively elaborate by using the concepts of detailed layers to ensure the customer\u2019s needs are met.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2811991,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

 \\n As I prepare questions, I always include two tiers,  \\n engaging questions that open up the dialogue,  \\n and probing questions that elicit more detail.  \\n I've attached a list of interview questions  \\n as an exercise file for this video.  \\n Please take a look.  \\n You'll see all kinds of questions that go  \\n from interviewing high-level stakeholders,  \\n to customers, to process experts  \\n with great examples of engaging and probing questions.  \\n So now it's time to think about conducting the interview.  \\n I like to take some time to build a little rapport  \\n before getting to the heart of the interview,  \\n using those personal connection points  \\n I thought about in advance.  \\n Typically, I have three to five questions prepared  \\n for a 60-minute interview.  \\n I'll ask a few engaging questions  \\n and then some probing questions,  \\n always trying to maintain a conversational cadence and flow  \\n that's not too rigid or structured.  \\n Taking extensive notes can really wreck the flow.  \\n So at most, I create a framework of reminder bullets  \\n instead of trying to capture every single word they say.  \\n Next is the interview follow-up.  \\n It's a key piece of the interviewing that's often skipped.  \\n I touch base after an interview to make sure  \\n I've captured key points correctly.  \\n Don't ask your interviewee to review pages of notes,  \\n but instead ask them to clarify  \\n and validate a few important pieces of information.  \\n I also like to meet up and have them review a visual model  \\n I created based on my understanding of the details I heard.  \\n If you want to learn even more  \\n about creating and conducting interviews for requirements,  \\n please take a look at my course  \\n requirements elicitation interviews.  \\n It's dedicated to this critical technique.  \\n Interviewing stakeholders is about building relationships  \\n and evolving ideas into great solutions.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2419080\",\"duration\":168,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Brainstorming\",\"fileName\":\"580635_02_03_MM30_Brainstorming_2021Q1\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, examine brainstorming to elicit requirements and using brainstorming as a technique for various requirements related work and tasks.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2543026,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - I love a good brainstorming session, don't you?

Process models are kind of like a good conversation starter.  \\n They're the starting point  \\n of what will hopefully be a meaningful conversation.  \\n Process modeling is about creating a visual  \\n to explain a process or sequence of activities.  \\n It takes a lot of good conversations  \\n to deliver valuable solutions.  \\n That's probably why process modeling  \\n is the most commonly used technique  \\n for requirements analysis.  \\n It's a multi-purpose tool.  \\n You can use process models to ignite dialogue on the team,  \\n see where details fit into the big picture,  \\n visualize the process,  \\n organize requirements information,  \\n and analyze various detailed aspects  \\n of the product, system, or process.  \\n There are various levels of formality in process modeling,  \\n and I typically prefer a more informal style.  \\n I choose a more informal style  \\n because it supports the purpose  \\n of requirements analysis work,  \\n which tends to be more about dialogue,  \\n alignment, shared understanding,  \\n and capturing a memory of a conversation  \\n at many levels of detail.  \\n I find most business requirements work  \\n is more about the conversation,  \\n and to support good conversations,  \\n process models need to be simple.  \\n Stakeholders and the team need to be able  \\n to read and understand the models  \\n intuitively, without a tutorial.  \\n The dialogue when looking at a model  \\n should be about the process,  \\n not about how to read the diagram.  \\n More formal, intricate process models  \\n are great for detailed system analysis,  \\n or trying to have a machine read the process model.  \\n Here are my favorite go-to principles  \\n when using process models.  \\n First, know what you are modeling.  \\n Are you modeling the current state or future state?  \\n Typically, we're defining the future state  \\n with requirements,  \\n and only looking back when needed  \\n to reuse some of the current state.  \\n Be careful not to focus too much on the current state.  \\n We're designing the future, not the past.  \\n Next, the best process models  \\n progressively elaborate and are built in layers.  \\n Try not to put all the detail into a single model.  \\n Start high-level,  \\n and progress to the details layer by layer.  \\n Make it action-oriented and be specific.  \\n Name the process and its activities  \\n in a verb plus noun format.  \\n Avoid using ambiguous words like manage,  \\n process,  \\n handle,  \\n and coordinate.  \\n These words are so easy to get a group to agree on,  \\n but they build false consensus  \\n and cause more problems later.  \\n They are untestable, and they force developers  \\n to interpret or guess what's really needed or meant.  \\n I've attached an exercise file  \\n of words to avoid and words to use in your models.  \\n Now, let's look at an example.  \\n In this process flow for payment checkout,  \\n you see the verb plus noun format  \\n for every step in the process.  \\n The verbs used, select, enter, and confirm,  \\n are all actionable verbs  \\n that are testable and easily understood by developers.  \\n You may be wondering, what about all the details?  \\n If process models are supposed to stay simple,  \\n then where are the details  \\n like decisions, exceptions, and alternative paths tracked?  \\n We could model them all out, but that might get complicated.  \\n So instead, I prefer to use a decision table  \\n for each step in the process  \\n to show the logic within each step.  \\n I also like to align and attach other details,  \\n like scenarios and user interface mock-ups,  \\n to each step of the process flow.  \\n Using simple process models  \\n with details provided as supplements to each step  \\n helps teams collaborate more effectively.  \\n It keeps the information organized in buckets  \\n that are consumable and ready for conversation.  \\n Process models are great tools for requirements.  \\n When done right, they inspire great conversation, analysis,  \\n and prevent gaps.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2418087\",\"duration\":277,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Context diagrams\",\"fileName\":\"580635_03_03_MM30_Context_2021Q1\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about the requirements technique, context, and scope diagrams and why they are beneficial to teams.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":4172033,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - I talk a lot about the importance of techniques  \\n that get everyone on the same page.  \\n It's what I call shared understanding.  \\n To build shared understanding  \\n you can't dive into the details on day one.  \\n You need to start with the big picture. You need context.  \\n Context diagrams are one of my favorite analysis techniques.  \\n They show the solutions big picture  \\n by providing a view of a system or product  \\n in its environment including the people  \\n and systems it interacts with.  \\n A context diagram helps teams identify scenarios,  \\n users, user goals, and external systems.  \\n It provides an overall outside-in perspective.  \\n I love working with context diagrams  \\n because it helps the team stay out of the details  \\n until we truly know and understand the big picture.  \\n So let's take a look at our online coffee store case study  \\n and build a context diagram together.  \\n We have included an exercise file that provides a summary  \\n of this case study.  \\n So where do we start?  \\n The center of a context diagram represents the product name,  \\n solution or domain.  \\n In this case, our domain is online ordering.  \\n From there you want to add the key people  \\n or roles that interact with the online order.  \\n Of course you're including your primary customer,  \\n but then add other internal and external roles,  \\n like the manager, warehouse worker and shipper.  \\n It's also important to include key internal  \\n and external systems that support online ordering.  \\n This is a big part of the big picture  \\n that helps the team get an understanding of a system's scope  \\n and complexity and can identify missing stakeholders.  \\n In this case we would use rectangles  \\n to identify our payment processors  \\n like PayPal and the credit cards  \\n and also show a box for internal data stores.  \\n Notice we don't call out every data store individually.  \\n That's too much detail,  \\n but we did call out PayPal separate from credit cards.  \\n Can you guess why that might be important?  \\n Perhaps it's a new payment option  \\n our organization hasn't used before  \\n or we already know it requires  \\n a significantly different interface than our credit cards.  \\n Next, we explore the interactions between our entities  \\n and our goal using directional arrows.  \\n Each arrow and phrase represents the intentions  \\n of that user role or system with the solution.  \\n For example, our customer intends to browse items,  \\n place items in a cart and check out items.  \\n In return our solution needs to receive the order  \\n and send status notifications to the user.  \\n Our warehouse workers need to view the orders  \\n and update orders.  \\n Our credit card partners need to receive payment data  \\n and return payment confirmation data and so on,  \\n until all the primary interactions  \\n between entities are diagrammed.  \\n This context diagram is a great representation  \\n of the intended scope at a summary level  \\n that can be used throughout the project.  \\n A few tips when working with context diagrams.  \\n First, do not connect the user roles to each other  \\n or the rectangle entities.  \\n Though this may feel natural to do so,  \\n it implies sequence and this model is about interaction  \\n and data, not sequence.  \\n Next, try to keep it to about 15 total arrows.  \\n It will be tempting to get much more detailed,  \\n but worth it to keep it at a higher level  \\n to maintain readability.  \\n Other models will cover the details better.  \\n This model is about context and the big picture.  \\n Last, try not to make this a technical architecture diagram  \\n of the technical components.  \\n This is a context model to help with user and business  \\n point of view.  \\n When done right, leaders and QA teams, especially,  \\n love this diagram.  \\n It's a visual that everyone  \\n can quickly get on the same page with.  \\n The dialogue it creates with the team is

and the benefit.  \\n Let's look at an example from our  \\n online coffee store case study.  \\n As an online shopper, I want to provide  \\n a credit care on file so that I do not need  \\n to reenter my credit card information  \\n each time I make a purchase.  \\n In this user story, the who or role  \\n is the online shopper.  \\n The what or goal is provide a credit card on file.  \\n And the why or benefit is so that I don't have  \\n to reenter information.  \\n This story needs more details that come out in conversation  \\n and that conversation needs to be captured.  \\n We use acceptance criteria to show the details  \\n of what success looks like in this story  \\n from a user point of view.  \\n Acceptance criteria for this user story is  \\n how the online shopper would describe  \\n this story as working.  \\n For example, some acceptance criteria would look like this.  \\n When I enter a credit card number that does not match  \\n the type, I should be notified and be able  \\n to reenter to correct the issue.  \\n I also should be able to simply select the expiration date  \\n on a visual calendar, rather than type in a date.  \\n Our goal is to make each user story  \\n a discrete piece of user functionality.  \\n However, as the project evolves, it's quite common  \\n to discover user stories that are too big  \\n because they include multiple pieces of functionality  \\n that need to be discussed, analyzed,  \\n and prioritized, separately.  \\n In that case, we need to apply a story splitting technique.  \\n When splitting a story, we will keep it  \\n from a user point of view and avoid splitting  \\n by technical component or a team activity.  \\n For example, some ways to split  \\n our credit card story would be  \\n as an online shopper, I want to select the type  \\n of credit card I am using so that I can make sure  \\n my entry is accurate for the card type.  \\n As an online shopper, I want to enter the  \\n credit card number so that I can have it  \\n saved for future use.  \\n And, as an online shopper, I want to enter  \\n my expiration date so I can get my credit card validated  \\n as a form of payment.  \\n Splitting stories like this is important to breaking  \\n down the story into smaller pieces for deep dialog,  \\n analysis, and prioritizing what's important.  \\n As user stories are created and split  \\n a story map is a great way to analyze how  \\n all of the stories fit together.  \\n Organizing user stories in a visual format helps  \\n the entire team see the forest through the trees.  \\n A story map tells the whole story versus a small part of it.  \\n It's a technique that keeps the team focused  \\n on the user experience and results  \\n in better dialog and conversation.  \\n To create a user story map, we take all the user stories  \\n and place them in sequence of how a customer  \\n uses the product from left to right.  \\n The vertical columns of a story map provide the details  \\n under the higher level story or theme.  \\n For our online coffee store, user stories  \\n about browsing and searching would be on the left  \\n followed by selecting items, managing the cart, checkout,  \\n and on the far right, stories related  \\n to viewing shipping status or viewing previous orders.  \\n The stories listed vertically are detailed out such that  \\n the top line are buckets of stories or a theme  \\n and the detailed stories come below.  \\n Story mapping is a great way to discover gaps  \\n in requirements and analyze flow, data,  \\n and the user journey.  \\n User stories and story maps are  \\n great analysis techniques for all projects.  \\n I encourage you to continue to learn more  \\n about how to use this great technique  \\n to discover high quality requirements.  \\n

- We ask systems to make thousands of decisions every day.  \\n Getting the decision logic correct  \\n in our requirements is no easy task.  \\n Decision tables are a great way to organize  \\n and display decision logic,  \\n and I use them frequently for requirements analysis.  \\n Let's take a look at our online coffee store case study  \\n and use a payment example,  \\n and start thinking about which parts  \\n of the online payment process has decision logic.  \\n Things like if-then conditions, for example.  \\n One area that jumps out at me is shipping costs.  \\n Most companies have several different conditions  \\n that must be met to determine  \\n the appropriate shipping costs for an order.  \\n They might offer free shipping for preferred customers,  \\n discounted shipping for large orders  \\n or additional fees for next day shipping.  \\n These conditions, especially when combined  \\n generate dozens of decision paths  \\n that will make visual models  \\n sprawl across multiple pages, making it very hard  \\n for your stakeholders to understand and evaluate.  \\n In many cases, decisions are better modeled  \\n in a decision table.  \\n Let's start with a shipping calculation example.  \\n Here are the requirements written in a text format.  \\n To build a decision table,  \\n we start with defining the results  \\n or the decision to be made in the last column.  \\n In this case, the decision  \\n is not clear from the text requirement.  \\n However, when we ask ourselves  \\n what decision this logic supports,  \\n it becomes more obvious that the decision  \\n is to determine what costs  \\n the customer will pay for shipping.  \\n When considering this example,  \\n we need to analyze the text for the decisions and scenarios.  \\n So next we analyze the text-based rules for the conditions  \\n that contribute to making the decision  \\n and add them as column headers on the table.  \\n In this case, we would end up with conditions such as,  \\n are they a preferred customer?  \\n Is the order over $50?  \\n Is it standard versus rush shipping?  \\n Ideally, we want the conditions to be binary,  \\n a yes/no condition.  \\n And the ideal table has between two and four conditions.  \\n With these boundaries, the table stays small and manageable.  \\n If you have more conditions,  \\n consider putting together multiple tables  \\n that build into one.  \\n So now that we have the result and the conditions,  \\n we need to determine how many possible scenarios there are.  \\n When the conditions are a yes or no  \\n this calculation is easy.  \\n It's an exponent calculation.  \\n So for this one, three conditions  \\n with two options each  \\n is two raised to the third power or two cubed.  \\n With this math our decision table  \\n will have eight rows or eight scenarios.  \\n And this shows the importance of using  \\n binary yes/no conditions and keeping conditions limited.  \\n If not limited, the table gets very large  \\n and hard to review and analyze.  \\n Okay, so now we have the results,  \\n the conditions and the total number of scenarios.  \\n Next, we extrapolate out the eight scenarios  \\n into the various combinations.  \\n Now we are ready to determine the decisions  \\n of this logic and confirm them as a team.  \\n And this means completing the results column of the table.  \\n I like having the table prepared to this point  \\n and then reviewing with key stakeholders to gain consensus  \\n on the result column values.  \\n Keeping it collaborative like this gets others involved.  \\n Make sure to provide the framework of the table  \\n like the conditions and results,  \\n and a few example rows completed to get the group going.  \\n Using a decision table helps us pause to identify  \\n all of the scenarios and puts the logic  \\n into an easy to read, discuss, and review format.  \\n Developers and testers also love having this guide  \\n to make sure they're developing  \\n and testing the right scenarios and have clear results too.  \\n Decision tables also help keep our process models simple.  \\n They can provide the details of a step in the process  \\n and help minimize all of the decision diamonds.  \\n I find decision tables very helpful in my requirements work.  \\n They're a great technique for generating meaningful dialogue  \\n about decisions and logic.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2414134\",\"duration\":237,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Data flow

- Have you ever had to enter your address three times  \\n when buying something online?  \\n You enter your address on a screen  \\n when you create your profile,  \\n or start a purchase,  \\n so, why doesn't it show up later in the process  \\n for shipping, billing, confirmation page,  \\n and receipt, right?  \\n In requirements, we refer to this as data flow.  \\n Our stakeholders and users often assume  \\n that data flows to the various processes,  \\n and don't explicitly ask for this flow  \\n when they talk about their requirements.  \\n Data flow analysis is a critical tool  \\n for generating high quality requirements.  \\n Without data flow analysis, customer satisfaction drops  \\n and defects rise.  \\n Users get frustrated when they don't see the data  \\n they expect and are asked to reenter data  \\n they've already provided.  \\n Defects also increase when the data needed  \\n for automated decisions is not where it needs to be.  \\n A data flow diagram provides a great visual  \\n of the processes and the data that flows through them.  \\n It provides a big picture  \\n for the team to discuss and understand their data needs.  \\n This is a view that other models just don't show well.  \\n Let's look at our online payments example,  \\n and think about the primary processes our customers  \\n and systems need to complete.  \\n We'll keep these pretty high level  \\n and place them in circles in the center of the page.  \\n For example, the customer needs to tell us  \\n how they want to pay, select payment type.  \\n They need to enter their payment information,  \\n enter payment details,  \\n and tell us how and where they want it shipped,  \\n select shipping options.  \\n The system needs to validate the payment,  \\n calculate the shipping costs, and confirm the order.  \\n Then, we need to identify the data stores  \\n that hold the data needed to support the processes.  \\n We add those data stores  \\n to the bottom of the diagram, like this.  \\n Now, the most important and valuable part  \\n of the data flow diagram, the arrows.  \\n We look at each circle or process  \\n and determine what chunks of data need to flow to  \\n and from the process to the customer and the data stores.  \\n Let's look at the process to select payment type.  \\n What data does the customer need to provide  \\n to complete this process?  \\n The customer needs to select the payment type  \\n and that payment type needs to be stored  \\n in the customer payment information database.  \\n Why does the data need to be stored?  \\n Well, because the system will need to support the process  \\n to validate and authorize the payment.  \\n Let's fill in a few more arrows.  \\n When we get to the confirm order,  \\n we realize we need to get  \\n our customer order database involved.  \\n Our customer indicates they are ready to confirm the order.  \\n The order details are placed in the customer order database  \\n and the system sends the order summary to the customer.  \\n So, we're at the point where our data flow diagram  \\n includes everything we know.  \\n Is it complete?  \\n Well, probably not.  \\n A critical step in any diagramming process  \\n is collaborating with others  \\n and walking the diagram together.  \\n Facilitate the walkthrough  \\n by asking them questions like,  \\n where do we store the

- What is the status of my order?  \\n Status, or the state of something, is often a key part  \\n of the logic within many systems and processes.  \\n If status and timing are critical components of a solution,  \\n then state and sequence diagrams will boost the value  \\n of your requirements.  \\n Let's start with state diagrams.  \\n State diagrams show the different states  \\n something can take on.  \\n For example, your order online is in the cart,  \\n purchased, processing, shipped, or received.  \\n A state diagram shows all these states  \\n and what causes the state to change.  \\n Without understanding the states and how they change,  \\n your user experience will be compromised.  \\n Let's look at an example.  \\n This state diagram shows the various order statuses  \\n and what moves the order between the various states.  \\n This is critical in helping developers  \\n make sure that these events, data, and states happen  \\n in concert with the user actions and data flow.  \\n You can also create a state table to show the same analysis.  \\n It's a different visual to show the same thing,  \\n and it would look like this.  \\n Next, let's look at sequence diagrams.  \\n Sequence diagrams show the interaction between people  \\n and different parts of a system.  \\n It shows the messages that get sent  \\n between the parties over time.  \\n Sequence diagrams help teams build a shared understanding  \\n of how various messages flow between people and systems,  \\n and when responses are expected.  \\n This is important so that the team can see and discuss  \\n the interactions expected between various users and systems,  \\n and when they work alone and together.  \\n Let's look at an example.  \\n In this example, we can see where the user interacts  \\n with a user interface, and where the user interface  \\n takes the information further for processing  \\n that does not involve the user.  \\n Sequence diagrams can be at the business level  \\n or at a very technical level showing system level messages.  \\n Be sure to model what's needed for your intended audience.  \\n Sequence and state diagrams are a great part  \\n of a requirements analysis toolkit, and great for details  \\n that tend to get lost in translation with other models.  \\n We've stated the business level with these examples.  \\n and they can get very

 \\n Well, it can be if you know how to adapt your project  \\n and requirements approach.  \\n Many teams customize the package software more  \\n than what's truly beneficial.  \\n The users and organization need to adapt  \\n to the software process,  \\n rather than customize whenever possible.  \\n This will save the organization lots of pain and money  \\n in the future.  \\n When buying software, whether it's a package, cloud based,  \\n or any other pre-built solution,  \\n there are some key differences to consider  \\n when working with requirements.  \\n First, keep your requirements focused on the user  \\n and the activities they need to accomplish with the system.  \\n It doesn't serve the project to define technical  \\n and functional details  \\n of exactly how the user will perform the task,  \\n as the software is already built,  \\n and changing at that level is typically cost prohibitive.  \\n Even technical processes that use pre-built software  \\n need to be looked at from how it impacts the user.  \\n What's important is making sure  \\n that the software allows the users to perform  \\n their necessary activities.  \\n It's best from a cost perspective for the users to adapt  \\n to how the package has them perform the activity,  \\n rather than customizing it to how the user wants it to work.  \\n If the software purchased is altered  \\n and customized beyond configuration,  \\n the risk is it becomes more cost-effective  \\n to build it yourself.  \\n Many organizations that need customizations build  \\n extension services, rather than alter the code  \\n of the purchase software.  \\n Next, make sure to understand the business rules, logic,  \\n policies, and decisions  \\n you're looking for the system to perform.  \\n Then, make sure that the system allows you to configure  \\n and perform these rules with the needed data inputs.  \\n This is typically in the configuration part of a system  \\n where you're allowed to configure the inner rules  \\n of each step a user performs for an activity.  \\n Then consider how the purchase software defines  \\n and connects data.  \\n Prebuilt software has predefined data definitions,  \\n assumptions, and relationships, and in many cases,  \\n these differ from the buyer's data definitions,  \\n assumptions, and relationships.  \\n It's important to identify  \\n and understand these differences before implementation.  \\n This usually comes out when reports don't seem right,  \\n and later in the research,  \\n we find that the data means  \\n something different than we thought,  \\n and last, integrations.  \\n Integrations are critical to most purchase software,  \\n as organizations want systems to exchange data  \\n to and from the purchase software.  \\n It's important to define the business purpose  \\n of each integration,  \\n the process its supports, and the user impact  \\n with and without the integration.  \\n Once these are known,  \\n we have enough context to work on the details.  \\n The details typically include defining the data needed  \\n between the systems and the detailed data attributes.  \\n Take a look at the exercise file I've created  \\n for you to find more considerations for integrations.  \\n For many organizations, the balance is tipping  \\n towards buying software,  \\n rather than building it from the ground up.  \\n It can be a great cost saver if done right.  \\n Doing it right relies  \\n on the team's ability to help users adapt their needs  \\n and activities to a different look, feel,  \\n and sometimes a different process.  \\n Make sure your users, rules,  \\n data and integration needs are thought through,  \\n and you will likely see the promise realized  \\n of purchase software.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"4.

We ask Systems to make thousands of decisions every day.\\nGetting the decision logic correct in our requirements\\nis no easy task.\\nDecision Tables are a great way to organize\\nand display decision logic,\\nand I use them frequently for requirements analysis.\\nLet's take a look at our online coffee store case study\\nand use a payment example, and start thinking about\\nwhich parts of the online payment process\\nhas decision logic, things like if-then conditions\\nfor example.\\n\\nOne area that jumps out at me is shipping costs.\\nMost companies have several different conditions\\nthat must be met to determine the appropriate shipping costs\\nfor an order.\\nThey might offer free shipping for preferred customers,\\ndiscounted shipping for large orders,\\nor additional fees for next day shipping.\\nThese conditions, especially when combined,\\ngenerate dozens of decision paths\\nthat will make visual models sprawl across multiple pages,\\nmaking it very hard for your stakeholders to understand\\nand evaluate.\\n\\nIn many cases, decisions are better modeled\\nin a decision table.\\nLet's start with a shipping calculation example.\\nHere are the requirements written in a text format.\\nTo build a decision table, we start with defining the result\\nor the decision to be made, in the last column.\\nIn this case, the decision is not clear\\nfrom the text requirement, however, when we ask ourselves\\nwhat decision this logic supports, it becomes more obvious\\nthat the decision is to determine what costs\\nthe customer will pay for shipping.\\n\\nWhen considering this example, we need to analyze the text\\nfor the decisions and scenarios.\\nSo next, we analyze the text based rules\\nfor the conditions that contribute to making the decision\\nand add them as column headers on the table.\\nIn this case, we would end up with conditions such as,\\nare they a preferred customer, is the order over $50,\\nis it standard versus rush shipping?\\nIdeally, we want the conditions to be binary,\\na Yes/No condition, and the ideal table has between two\\nand four conditions.\\n\\nWith these boundaries, the table stays small and manageable.\\nIf you have more conditions, consider putting together\\nmultiple tables that build into one.\\nSo, now that we have the result and the conditions,\\nwe need to determine how many possible scenarios there are.\\nWhen the conditions are a yes or no,\\nthis calculation is easy.\\nIt's an exponent calculation.\\nSo for this one, three conditions with two options each,\\nis two raised to the third power or two cubed.\\n\\nWith this math, our decision table will have eight rows\\nor eight scenarios, and this shows the importance\\nof using binary Yes/No conditions\\nand keeping conditions limited.\\nIf not limited, the table gets very large\\nand hard to review and analyze.\\nOkay, so now we have the results, the conditions,\\nand the total number of scenarios.\\nNext, we extrapolate out the eight scenarios\\ninto the various combinations.\\n\\nNow we are ready to determine the decisions of this logic\\nand confirm them as a team, and this means completing\\nthe results column of the table.\\nI like having the table prepared to this point\\nand than reviewing with key stakeholders\\nto gain consensus on the results column values.\\nKeeping it

Buying software is so much easier than building it, right?\\nWell, it can be if you know how to adapt\\nyour project and requirements approach.\\nMany teams customize the packaged software\\nmore than what's truly beneficial.\\nThe users and organization need to adapt\\nto the software process rather than\\ncustomize whenever possible.\\nThis will save the organization lots of pain\\nand money in

the four things to consider\\nwhen working on requirements for buying\\nor implementing a package software.\\nKeep user goals front and center.\\nBusiness rules and logic,\\ndata definitions, and integrations.\\nLet's go through each of these in more detail.\\nFirst, keep your requirements focused\\non the user and the activities they need\\nto accomplish with the system.\\nIt doesn't serve the project to define\\ntechnical and functional details\\nof exactly how the user will perform the task,\\nas the software is already built,\\nand changing at that level is typically cost prohibitive.\\n\\nEven technical processes that use prebuilt software\\nneed to be looked at from how it impacts the user.\\nWhat's important is making sure that the software\\nallows the users to perform their necessary activities.\\nIt's best from a cost perspective\\nfor the users to adapt to how the package\\nhas them perform the activity\\nrather than customizing it to how the user\\nwants it to work.\\nIf the software purchased is altered\\nand customized beyond configuration,\\nthe risk is it becomes more cost effective\\nto build it yourself.\\n\\nMany organizations that need customizations\\nbuild extension services rather than\\nalter the code of the purchased software.\\nNext, make sure to understand the business rules,\\nlogic, policies, and decisions you're looking\\nfor the system to perform.\\nThen, make sure that the system allows you\\nto configure and perform these rules\\nwith the needed data inputs.\\nThis is typically in the configuration part of a system\\nwhere you're allowed to configure the inner rules\\nof each step a user performs for an activity.\\n\\nThen, consider how the purchased software\\ndefines and connects data.\\nPrebuilt software has predefined data definitions,\\nassumptions, and relationships.\\nAnd in many cases, these differ from\\nthe buyer's data definitions,\\nassumptions, and relationships.\\nIt's important to identify and understand\\nthese differences before implementation.\\nThis usually comes out when reports don't seem right,\\nand later in the research we find\\nthat the data means something different than we thought.\\n\\nAnd last, integrations.\\nIntegrations are critical to most purchased software\\nas organizations want systems to exchange data\\nto and from the purchased software.\\nIt's important to define the business purpose\\nof each integration, the process it supports,\\nand the user impact with and without the integration.\\nOnce these are known, we have enough context\\nto work on the details.\\nThe details typically include\\ndefining the data needed between the systems\\nand the detailed data attributes.\\n\\nTake a look at the Exercise File I've created for you\\nto find more considerations for integrations.\\nFor many organizations, the balance is tipping\\ntowards buying software rather than building it\\nfrom the ground up.\\nIt can be a great cost saver if done right.\\nDoing it right relies on the team's ability\\nto help users adapt their needs and activities\\nto a different look, feel,\\nand sometimes a different process.\\nMake sure your users,

steps\\nfor improving a business process, a company,\\nand a person are rather similar.\\nIn business, everything should begin with goals\\nand stakeholders, and so this is where we start\\nour

agent,\\nthere's some things you must consider.\\nFor this example, let's say you hire me\\nas your change agent or life coach.\\nSo, you are the stakeholder, and you want to improve yourself.\\nBefore we get to the goals,\\nwe'll establish a desired state\\nby which the goals will be achieved.\\n\\nSo let's say we establish a five-year timeline.\\nWhat would it take to feel successful in five years?\\nThe honest answer for most of us is we're not too sure.\\nWe'd like to be happy, healthy, and comfortable.\\nPerhaps you want a better job.\\nOr maybe you'd like to be rich

want a better job,\\nyou may want to say that you want to be the VP of marketing\\nfor a specific company.\\nYou say you want to be rich?\\nGive us a monetary goal.\\nYou want a nice home?\\nGive us a location or size for that dream home.\\nThose are all measurable.\\nAt the end of the project,\\nwe'll be able to definitively measure\\nwhether or not you reached your goal,\\nand by how much you may have exceeded or missed the goal.\\nBut establishing measurable goals is difficult.\\n\\nAnd you may be embarrassed to say them\\nout loud to a stranger,\\nespecially if right now, you're

used.\\nThen, we have unsupervised learning algorithms.\\nFirst, there is clustering, which tries to group\\ncustomers based on similar attribute values.\\nOne example is to group patients into groups

[Instructor] Let us take a look at the tools\\nand techniques used for prescriptive analytics.\\nThe first tool used in prescriptive analytics\\nis linear programming.\\nLinear programming is a technique used\\nto maximize an outcome given the list of constraints.\\nOutcome could be units sold, profit margin, et cetera.\\nIt assumes a linear relationship between variables.\\nIt makes simplifying assumptions.\\n\\nConstraints used in linear programming\\ninclude budget, time, resource limits, et cetera.\\nHere is an example of how linear programming looks like.\\nWe are trying to find the values of x and y,\\nsuch that we get the maximum value for zed.\\nThe constraints that are there include\\nthat x could be between zero and hundred\\nand y should be between 50 and 150\\nand x is greater than y.\\n\\nZed could be the total units sold,\\nwhile x and y could be the number of individual products\\nthat can be sold based on inventory capacity.\\nThe second technique used is decision analysis.\\nDecision analysis consists of a set of procedures,\\nmethods, and tools that are used to analyze\\nbusiness decisions.\\nThis is usually structured brainstorming.\\nThe goal of decision analysis is\\nto create alternatives available,\\nincluding a no-action or status quo alternative.\\n\\nFirst, you evaluate the individual alternatives\\nfor benefits to the business,\\nboth monetary and non-monetary.\\nNext, you estimate costs for the business,\\nincluding budget, time, and resources.\\nYou then look at the outside world\\nand evaluate threats to the strategy.\\nThis includes environmental, political,\\neconomical, and competition related threats\\nthat can impact the performance of the strategy.\\n\\nYou also try to look at new opportunities\\ncreated by the strategies,\\nlike new customers, upsells, et cetera.\\nOne of the key items you want to model is uncertainty.\\nA number of statistical techniques exist for this purpose.\\nDecision analysis involves a lot of team work.\\nIt requires members from different departments,\\nlike marketing, sales, IT, and analytics to work together\\nto come up with the overall analysis.\\n\\nThis is then provided to management as recommendations.\\nThe final tool in prescriptive analytics is simulation.\\nThe goal of a simulation exercise\\nis to simulate a real business situation\\nand measure outcomes.\\nSimulation is either done manually,\\nsemi-automated in a spreadsheet,\\nor fully automated through a computer program.\\nInputs to the simulation process can be either actual\\nor can be simulated all through mathematical models.\\n\\nIt is important to consider all environmental variables\\nthat might impact the outcome.\\nSimulation is only as good as the variables considered\\nand their proper modeling.\\nIt is run for multiple scenarios and options,\\nand the outcomes are measured and compared.\\nControlled simulation is also done by modifying one input\\nand measuring its impact on the output.\\nNext, we look at the use case to see\\nhow prescriptive analytics can be used.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:715897\",\"duration\":177,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"PSA use

at improvement of some variable\\nlike decrease in cholesterol.\\n\\nThe test is then iterated on multiple subsets of patients\\nto make sure that the results are consistent\\non different subsets.\\nThe next type of testing is A/B testing.\\nThis is a very popular testing technique\\nused by software companies\\nto understand how users react to new features\\non their website.\\nIn

options\\nand the best one chosen.\\nThe test can be repeated if required on additional subsets\\nto ensure that the results are consistent.\\n\\nThe next type of testing is multivariate testing.\\nIn this case, we see how a specific hypothesis performs\\nunder different environmental conditions.\\nA subset of the target population is chosen for the test.\\nThe test is then executed with a fixed set of variables.\\nFor example, we would choose to provide\\na cholesterol medication to patients\\nwithout doing any diet or exercise.\\n\\nThe test is then executed after adjusting some variables,\\nsay the cholesterol test is repeated for the same patient\\nwhile they do diet but no exercise,\\nthen it is repeated again with doing both diet and exercise.\\nThe results of the test

 \\n We might need some Training,  \\n so I enter that deliverable and we might want to mark it  \\n that we have an improved website.  \\n So we'll have some marketing done,  \\n and I'll enter Marketing.  \\n I'm now going to copy down the project objective  \\n of website upgrade next to each of these deliverables.  \\n So that each thing we're delivering,  \\n we know why it's needed.  \\n Next, we need our business requirements, those features.  \\n So yep, in the next column,  \\n I'll title it Business requirements.  \\n We want to list now what is required  \\n to achieve those project objectives  \\n and deliver those deliverables.  \\n Start simple and just listen to your stakeholders.  \\n For our Website upgrade,  \\n I hear things like a subscription feature,  \\n so I enter that here.  \\n And they mentioned those pretty interactive images  \\n of site amenities.  \\n So I'll insert another row here  \\n and add Amenities interactive images.  \\n And I'll copy down my deliverable  \\n this requirements trace to along with its trace objective.  \\n Now these are high level what.  \\n So let's start getting into some details of the how.  \\n My how here are simply Solution requirements,  \\n and so I'll enter that here in the next column.  \\n Expand the column to fit.  \\n So then I can start entering in those details  \\n about the requirements.  \\n Like when my stakeholder said  \\n they want a notification of promotions,  \\n I'll enter that here next to Subscription features,  \\n Notification of promotions.  \\n And when talking about the subscriptions,  \\n my stakeholders mentioned the ability to self subscribe.  \\n So since that's tied to the Subscription feature,  \\n I'll add a new line and enter Self-subscribed requirement.  \\n And I'll ensure it's traced to its Subscription feature  \\n in all the corresponding trace deliverables  \\n and project objectives.  \\n Copy it down.  \\n Now Self-subscribed is traced to the business requirement  \\n and all the deliverables and project objectives  \\n that requirement supports.  \\n And now my stakeholders mentioned  \\n a great non-functional requirement  \\n of wanting mobile views or accessible on mobile devices.  \\n So again, this is back to that subscription feature.  \\n So we add another line and copy down  \\n the Subscription feature and all its trace requirements  \\n right from the start.  \\n And then I'll add into the Solution requirements  \\n Available on mobile devices.  \\n Even If you're not sure how these things  \\n might get implemented,  \\n keep listening to your stakeholders.  \\n So I'm going to add in the next column Use case,  \\n and expand it a little bit.  \\n So when I hear stakeholders  \\n talking about being able to subscribe to notifications  \\n when on their smartphone,  \\n that's exactly what I want to capture here.  \\n In the Use case column, for the mobile device requirement,  \\n I enter Subscribe via smartphone,  \\n and expand the column to fit.  \\n This gives some great context to each of our requirements  \\n as we elicit them.  \\n You add in the requirements  \\n at whatever level you identify the math  \\n and then just work to trace them back to objectives,  \\n aligning as needed.  \\n And then now any gaps that remain  \\n is where you know you need to complete your analysis work.  \\n So you work towards your goal of fully trace requirements  \\n in a well laid out, easy to read  \\n requirements traceability matrix.  \\n Then just keep listening for requirements.  \\n If a user states they need to access the website  \\n from a tablet device, then capture that use case.  \\n Just make sure you can trace it to the requirements.  \\n This requirement is Available on mobile devices,  \\n so it's traced to that one,  \\n which is then trace to our prior business requirements  \\n and deliverables and objectives, so I copy those down.  \\n Now, Access via tablet is nicely traced.  \\n And if something wants to throw out,  \\n something that sounds more like a want than a need.  \\n Say IT asks for a test and development site,  \\n go ahead and still enter it as a solutions requirement,  \\n Test and development site,  \\n here are my solution requirements.  \\n And then ask, what requirement does this support?  \\n For example here,  \\n the Landon team might want to add more features  \\n in the future.  \\n So that's the business requirement for this,  \\n Ability to easily add new features in the future.  \\n So I enter in business requirements  \\n Ability to easily add new features.  \\n And then you get your stakeholders to confirm  \\n this is an objective of an Upgraded website.  \\n And so then I can trace this business requirement  \\n to its deliverable and objective.  \\n An Upgraded website is the deliverable that it supports  \\n and website upgrade project objective.  \\n Now, Test and development site is nicely traced.  \\n And we validate this again  \\n by asking the stakeholders for an example of a use case.  \\n They say they want to be able to add new features  \\n to only one section of the website  \\n and not have to redo the whole website.  \\n So I add that in.  \\n Here in the Use case add Able to add a new feature  \\n to only one section of the website.  \\n Now you have a complete picture of not only what's required,  \\n but you also have a valuable tool to help organize  \\n and logically analyze your requirements.  \\n Anything that stakeholders want to see in the project,  \\n you can trace and show the value of each small piece  \\n is adding to the larger overall objectives.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3025079\",\"duration\":371,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Tracing requirements through testing\",\"fileName\":\"3001270_en_US_01_03_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn how to utilize your requirements to facilitate testing and confirmation of the delivered solution.

 \\n Well, what do you test?  \\n So we literally add a column for test case.  \\n I'll expand that out a little bit.  \\n And then I always put a test case  \\n description in the next column,  \\n again, expanding out to fit.  \\n And I'll even wrap the text for easier reading.  \\n This way, now, I start capturing the details  \\n of what we're testing, that we truly delivered  \\n the value adding features.  \\n Say for the smartphone requirement,  \\n I'm going to break up the acceptance criteria  \\n and do small, more manageable tests.  \\n First let's make sure the smartphone can access the website.  \\n So I'll add a test case, access via smartphone,  \\n and I'll put a description in there.  \\n Website is accessible from smartphone  \\n and displays all website features.  \\n So I know now what we'll be testing,  \\n but I'll add another row because there's more  \\n than one test case for requirement,  \\n and that's perfectly normal.  \\n I'll add another row and just ensure  \\n I copied down all the trace requirements.  \\n And so here, I'll add another test case to subscribe  \\n to the sales promotions via smartphone,  \\n and then I'll enter a description  \\n of what I'm testing and validating here.  \\n On a mobile device, we want to be able to select  \\n subscribe to sales promotions,  \\n able to enter our email address and select subscribe,  \\n and then get a confirmation screen that shows to the user.  \\n We're getting a lot of details here,  \\n but the traceability matrix is what helps keep you focused.  \\n If you're editing these items,  \\n we want to trace them all the way through testing.  \\n So now you add in an expected outcomes in the next column.  \\n I'll enter expected outcomes in column M.  \\n Here now in this column is where you can  \\n enter what you expect to happen.  \\n So say for our smartphone test case,  \\n I'll enter of the expected outcome of that on a smartphone,  \\n navigation and menus, subscription features, reservation,  \\n amenity, views, they all display.  \\n And I'll do this now for every single test case,  \\n as this is where you define what is right  \\n or correct functionality that we want our testers to verify.  \\n We then add in the next column, actual outcomes.  \\n I'm going to expand it to fit.  \\n This is where testers can capture  \\n what actually happened when testing.  \\n So that means I'll need another column.  \\n So now I'm going to add in a status column.  \\n Status.  \\n This allows me to track the status of each test case.  \\n As for the results, if the expected outcome  \\n is the exact same as the actual outcome,  \\n then we know the test case has passed.  \\n And so I would simply put the status here as pass.  \\n We'll center for easy reading.  \\n If the expected and actuals, though, do not match,  \\n then the test case is a fail.  \\n And you'd want to now do some  \\n root cause analysis whenever test cases fail.  \\n But the status column is really helpful  \\n to help you manage your entire testing effort,  \\n as you could add in additional statuses,  \\n such as not started and in progress.  \\n And so now you're not just managing requirements,  \\n you're tracking the entire delivery  \\n of those requirements by keeping them traced.  \\n And the coolest thing, if you've tested everything,  \\n and they all pass, then you know  \\n you've delivered all the requirements.  \\n Why?

 \\n Where are we at?  \\n What's involved?  \\n Who's involved?  \\n And so on.  \\n A context diagram is literally  \\n getting the context of what's going on.  \\n So these are great for things like  \\n identifying the solution components,  \\n listing all the stakeholders who might be involved,  \\n understanding customer basis,  \\n detailing the technical architecture,  \\n what you'll see commonly referred to as a data flow diagram,  \\n and even identifying access points.  \\n And so I'll go back to my diagram  \\n 'cause I realized I should also add in customer  \\n as well as vendors.  \\n So I'm going to click on my Smart Art  \\n and add a new line for customers  \\n as well as vendors.  \\n These both have a relationship through our website upgrade.  \\n And again, whatever's in context.  \\n And yes, it was asked about integrating  \\n the customer relationship management system.  \\n I'm not sure this is in scope yet,  \\n so I'll just add it to the screen here  \\n to show I heard the idea.  \\n Just insert a new shape, use the circle,  \\n put it over here,  \\n customer relationship management system,  \\n CRM,  \\n and adjust the text to fit,  \\n but I'm going to change the color now  \\n to denote that it needs to be confirmed.  \\n You can see that it's not linked to our project right now,  \\n but we have it literally on our view, our context,  \\n to consider as we move forward.  \\n So this kind of visual context is great  \\n when you've been thrown in the middle of a project  \\n or change effort that's already started  \\n or when your stakeholders start rattling off  \\n lots of different systems and technologies  \\n and you're trying to just understand  \\n their business relationship.  \\n They can also be valuable on being clear  \\n on what internal resources and assets are being used  \\n versus external vendors, clients,  \\n and consultants are providing.  \\n These diagrams are such a great way  \\n to quickly see the scope of an effort, and again,  \\n just get everyone on the same page of understanding.  \\n Just don't put in process steps,  \\n go ahead and use a process model for that,  \\n or any kind of organizational reporting and hierarchy.  \\n Again, organizational models are better for that.  \\n And know that while simple,  \\n you may need to do a couple of different context diagrams  \\n for your effort if it gets too cluttered.  \\n Like for example here,  \\n I might need a technology focus view,  \\n so I'll create one for the technology elements,  \\n and maybe even change the shape and color  \\n to denote that these are technology elements.  \\n And when there's too many stakeholders to discuss,  \\n I might make another one for stakeholders.  \\n And again, I'll just change up the color and shape  \\n to identify that these are stakeholders.  \\n And that's what you want.  \\n Use these diagrams in your analysis work  \\n when you need to focus  \\n and center on the work that needs to get done  \\n and all the elements that have to be considered.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3020812\",\"duration\":290,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Setting up your basic context diagram\",\"fileName\":\"3001270_en_US_03_02_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn how to set up and utilize a basic context diagram to help you understand any scope of effort under analysis.

 \\n And my stakeholders might say an upgrade to website.  \\n So I'll add an element, upgraded website,  \\n or they might mention marketing, so I'll add that in.  \\n And I'll ask who do we have to work with?  \\n And they mention IT, sales team, customer service.  \\n So let's add those in.  \\n IT,  \\n sales team  \\n and customer service.  \\n I'll then ask what other projects  \\n or activities are also going on  \\n or we have to consider.  \\n There's mention of a CRM upgrade  \\n as well as marketing planning for some holiday specials.  \\n So we'll note those here  \\n by adding context of a CRM upgrade  \\n and marketing holiday specials.  \\n Again, I like to have my stakeholders  \\n give me as much information as possible in a live session,  \\n but don't be afraid to continue to add an update.  \\n You may add in anything else you find  \\n during your analysis work  \\n as you can always confirm and validate items  \\n as you continue to review and use your diagram.  \\n Now once you have the items here,  \\n then you think about the relationships.  \\n That's what a line represents  \\n when you do a context diagram.  \\n You can start asking questions like  \\n what is the relationship?  \\n Does one have one of the other?  \\n A one-to-many relationship?  \\n Is there data flowing from one source to another?  \\n Are messages being sent and received between two items?  \\n Does one depend on the other?  \\n Or is one a small component or subset of the larger one?  \\n And if you have this one, must you have the other element?  \\n So going back to our diagram, I look at our central idea,  \\n our website upgrade, and think about how it relates  \\n to each of the elements we added.  \\n So for our website upgrade,  \\n we'll deliver an upgraded website.  \\n I grab an arrow tool and connect website upgrade  \\n to upgraded website and label the relationship as delivers.  \\n And again, for marketing, draw the line,  \\n then label it simply needs marketing.  \\n And I'll continue to ask this relationship question  \\n for each element listed,  \\n connecting each with a simple arrow,  \\n then labeling the relationship.  \\n Again, try to do this with your stakeholders  \\n so they give you the answer.  \\n Why?  \\n Because sometimes we think of something,  \\n but it's not really in scope.  \\n It's good to be aware of, sure,  \\n but just doesn't apply at this point in time,  \\n like the IT is worried about the change  \\n in leadership right now.  \\n So go ahead and add that to the diagram,  \\n change in leadership,  \\n and when I ask how is this connected  \\n to our website upgrade project?  \\n And no one knows.  \\n So then I just leave it.  \\n It's a great way to show items  \\n that could potentially be out of scope,  \\n but lets you acknowledge this stakeholder's input.  \\n Also, because this is an analysis tool,  \\n it's okay if you have some lines missing.  \\n This just means you have to do some more analysis work  \\n to find out how and why,  \\n even if the item is related or included.  \\n And so, the final key is then to use your diagram  \\n throughout your entire change effort.  \\n Don't just create once and toss to the side.  \\n Every time there's a discussion about designs, delivery,  \\n or even simply, should the team do something or not?  \\n Pull out the diagram.  \\n It's a great tangible item to bounce ideas off of,  \\n but then, also consider it a living document.  \\n What I mean is, as your work evolves,  \\n if new information is found out,  \\n then simply add it to your diagram.  \\n If something changes, then change the diagram,  \\n maybe even highlighting the change,  \\n because then, at the end of your effort or project,  \\n you'll have not only a powerful visual of the change,  \\n you'll have a resource that can continue  \\n to be used for future efforts.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3017842\",\"duration\":280,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using a context data flow diagram\",\"fileName\":\"3001270_en_US_03_03_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"This video shows you how to create and utilize a context data flow diagram.

 \\n In this case, there might be a simple confirmation message.  \\n So I draw a line with an arrow going back to the web form,  \\n and then label it as confirmation message.  \\n And so you keep asking what else?  \\n I'll put the CRM system on here since someone mentioned it,  \\n customer relationship management system.  \\n So as a good analyst, then I ask, how is this related?  \\n And my stakeholders may say that the subscription feature  \\n needs to save the customer profile with their email address  \\n in our CRM database.  \\n Okay, two things here, though.  \\n First, save customer profile with email.  \\n So let's add that connection.  \\n Then I heard CRM database, so let's add that here.  \\n 'Cause this is a storage location,  \\n not a function or system like our other circles,  \\n I'm going to use a box and label it CRM database.  \\n This notation is common, you'll see,  \\n when doing data flow diagrams,  \\n but don't worry too much about format right now.  \\n Now I'll add the arrow that the CRM data,  \\n in this case, customer profile and customer email,  \\n are stored in this database.  \\n And then again, think about any data coming back.  \\n We add in that arrow  \\n that the CRM system receives confirmation  \\n of both the stored profile and email address.  \\n Now we are starting to get some great context  \\n and set space for good questions,  \\n as seeing this, my stakeholders then might ask,  \\n what if the customer profile already exists?  \\n Remember, we want both current and future customers.  \\n So we can add in another line to update customer profile.  \\n And then as a customer,  \\n I want to see my profile and just update or confirm it.  \\n So the CRM system would return the current customer profile  \\n to user of this subscription feature.  \\n So draw that in here,  \\n that CRM system returns current customer profile.  \\n Notice there's no order here.  \\n We're solely focused on the data,  \\n knowing what is being sent where.  \\n Helps to get some logical structure for your solutions.  \\n A best practice is to include maybe a process model  \\n to help you articulate when and what is occurring  \\n that creates these data calls and processes.  \\n And so you keep asking what data  \\n the subscription feature needs.  \\n There's talk about showing product information  \\n based on subscription selections, so we add that in.  \\n And when we inquire where this data is,  \\n we learned there's a whole other database  \\n that marketing uses to manage product information.  \\n So we add that in, too.  \\n And now, don't forget about that web form.  \\n Where is that data being entered?  \\n Perhaps an IT person already decided  \\n it's using a Google form,  \\n so we just note that here for now, Google Form.  \\n And I'm using a different shape to help me realize  \\n this is an external item,  \\n what they might call an external entity.  \\n And so this form displays the form fields.  \\n So connect that back.  \\n Now, we've got some great context on what data we need  \\n and where it resides  \\n to start getting a better grasp  \\n on what the subscription feature actually is  \\n and needs to look like that we can continue to work with  \\n as we deliver the final solution.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

Customers?  \\n Are there different types of cameras  \\n or different types of customers?  \\n We use what's called data modeling techniques  \\n to figure it out.  \\n Now, picture yourself adding your nouns or products  \\n to the whiteboard on stickies.  \\n The first part of the data modeling technique is done.  \\n And now you can move on to the business rule model.  \\n Let's refer back to what we already know.  \\n Our nouns and verbs are what make the rules.  \\n Picture yourself with your stakeholder, again.  \\n You'll be listening during the discussion  \\n for relationships and differences.  \\n Here's a pro tip.  \\n Stickies are an effective way to show the differences,  \\n in this case,  \\n between different types of customers and cameras.  \\n Once identified, these rules identify the steps  \\n that apply for individual customers,  \\n as well as any pricing discounts that might apply.  \\n Now, the process model, data model,  \\n and business rule model will help you  \\n analyze requirements individually.  \\n But the real power comes from bringing it all together.  \\n Don't worry if you don't have formal complete models.  \\n Fragments of requirements still help you know  \\n what steps are needed to fulfill an order request,  \\n which exact product is being requested,  \\n what price is being charged  \\n depending on the product and the customer, et cetera.  \\n If you can map everything together,  \\n you'll be able to deliver a solution  \\n that exceeds the customer's expectations  \\n while still following the rules  \\n established by the organization.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"6.

 \\n Well, the takeaway is that business analysis  \\n is defined in different ways,  \\n depending on the point of view of the definer.  \\n But here's a stable definition  \\n that should work across all contexts.  \\n Business analysis seeks to identify  \\n and understand business needs  \\n and provide solutions to enable change.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2911931\",\"duration\":251,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"What is the role of a business analyst?\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_01_03_MM30_role\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn the tasks and goals of a business analysis.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3800781,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Let's look beyond the definitions  \\n to the individuals who perform these activities,  \\n the business analyst.  \\n Both IIBA and PMI defined the business analyst  \\n as any person who performs business analysis,  \\n no matter what their job title or organizational role.  \\n This role also varies  \\n based on a couple of different factors,  \\n the type of industry, size of the organization,  \\n maturity of the organization  \\n in terms of both project management  \\n and business analysis practices,  \\n as well as the project life cycle approach and methodology.  \\n More important than the role or position  \\n are the actual activities that they perform.  \\n So regardless of an individual's position  \\n or role in the organization,  \\n business analysts are focused  \\n on understanding the current needs  \\n in relation to the overall strategic objectives  \\n and goals of the organization,  \\n and then helping achieve these goals.  \\n A lot of what they do comes down to helping with change.  \\n The role is often different depending on the situation.  \\n The BA may be involved when a new product is created  \\n or a current product is enhanced.  \\n They can help solve a problem by understanding the situation  \\n and helping propose a solution.  \\n Often their skills are used to help project team members  \\n better understand the needs of the customer.  \\n There are two organizations  \\n where you might find a business analyst.  \\n First, in a business organization,  \\n or secondly, as a key member of a project team.  \\n As part of the business organization,  \\n the BA plays a role in helping craft strategic objectives,  \\n setting the future direction of the organization.  \\n This knowledge and understanding  \\n is then transferred to others  \\n who will support these objectives  \\n through projects or programs.  \\n In other organizations,  \\n the business analyst is on a project team.  \\n Their role is to provide understanding of the solutions  \\n for the identified problems or opportunities.  \\n Basically, the BA is the person  \\n that has to explain the solution.  \\n They explain why and what actually is involved.  \\n There's a number of ways these solutions can be provided,  \\n changes to ongoing operations may be required,  \\n or a continuous improvement initiative  \\n may need to be supported by a project or a program.  \\n The role provided by a business analyst continues to evolve.  \\n And that's really because they're so valuable  \\n across so many different situations.  \\n The analytical skills of the business analyst  \\n helps with several things.  \\n They're able to understand and define problems  \\n or opportunities more specifically.  \\n They see how these fit into the overall strategy  \\n of the organization.  \\n They understand and explain the reasons  \\n why projects were selected.  \\n An increasingly important role of the business analyst  \\n is that of a change agent.  \\n Change is inevitable, but it's hard.  \\n It's change from the current state  \\n to a desired future state.  \\n As Mark Twain once said,  \\n \\\"I'm in favor of progress, it's change I don't like.\\\"  \\n By working closely with individuals  \\n at all levels within an organization,  \\n the business analyst is able to understand  \\n how any change may impact them,  \\n and therefore, they're more likely to embrace it.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2911932\",\"duration\":220,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Business analyst skillset\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_01_04_MM30_skillsets\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Identify skill sets for a BA.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3308259,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" `- So, what are the skill sets of a business analyst?

Requirements come in all shapes and forms,  \\n but don't let that confuse you.  \\n In a nutshell,  \\n requirements are what we need to do.  \\n They're what we need to do to satisfy the customer,  \\n but what the customer puts in their list of requirements  \\n isn't necessarily what we'll eventually do.  \\n It's a wishlist that gives us a direction  \\n and depending on where you work or who the client is,  \\n these requirements come to us in different formats.  \\n It's our job to interpret that list  \\n and then determine the most appropriate way  \\n to fulfill the customer's needs.  \\n So, let's review the different types of requirements.  \\n There are six major categories.  \\n First, the business requirements.  \\n They represent the higher-level needs of the organization.  \\n Usually, business requirements are identified  \\n through the needs assessment process  \\n as either issues or opportunities.  \\n They're the reason why the project was selected  \\n and justified in the first place.  \\n The stakeholder requirements describe the needs  \\n of individual stakeholders or groups of stakeholders.  \\n These requirements could come  \\n from within the organization, internally  \\n or from customers, suppliers,  \\n partners or other external organizations.  \\n Solution requirements describe the features, functions  \\n and characteristics of the result.  \\n By result I mean,  \\n this is what the customer wants at the end of our work.  \\n Solution requirements have two sub categories,  \\n functional and nonfunctional requirements.  \\n Functional requirements describe  \\n what the user will be able to do  \\n or what they'll receive when we're done.  \\n So, this could be something like an online shopping site  \\n being able to process orders or returns.  \\n This type of requirement is just a high-level example  \\n of the features to be included.  \\n Nonfunctional requirements on the other hand,  \\n describe environment or quality of service conditions.  \\n These can also include technology requirements.  \\n An example might be the security requirements  \\n for your online store's credit card processing.  \\n Another category, transition requirements.  \\n These include the activities to help transition  \\n from the current state to the desired future state.  \\n These include training, documentation  \\n and possibly conversion and implementation requirements.  \\n Now, the next set of requirements are interesting  \\n because these are the responsibilities  \\n of the project manager not the business analyst,  \\n but we still need to know them  \\n to have a full picture of the process.  \\n I'm talking about project requirements.  \\n They're often specified by either agreements  \\n or internal procedures.  \\n They include processes and deliverables  \\n to ensure that the project is completed on time.  \\n These may include management reviews,  \\n status updates and performance reports.  \\n The last set of requirements  \\n identify the quality levels required.  \\n They're the responsibility of either a quality analyst  \\n or a group like quality assurance.  \\n These include the conditions or capability used  \\n to assess conformance to the requirements.  \\n Regardless of the type of requirement,  \\n it's important to define  \\n how requirements will be managed and tracked.  \\n To do this,  \\n and the traceability matrix,  \\n but don't worry about that,  \\n we'll address those in another video.  \\n What's important is managing and understanding requirements,  \\n because this helps you control the scope.  \\n Once you finalized your requirements and scope boundaries,  \\n stick to them.  \\n Requirements start out as an unprioritized wishlist.  \\n So, it's important to be clear  \\n about exactly which ones have been selected.  \\n That way you're more likely to provide the greatest value.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2917000\",\"duration\":237,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Requirements elicitation techniques\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_06_02_MM30_ellicitation\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Identify and describe different types of elicitation techniques.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3587467,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

When I buy something online,  \\n I really liked that I can track the package  \\n from its original warehouse, all the way to my door.  \\n Similarly, I can follow my Uber or Lyft driver  \\n as they make their way to my location.  \\n The reason this is so satisfying  \\n is that I can predict when the value will be delivered,  \\n and I can also tell when the planned arrival is disrupted.  \\n We track our packages, our rides, and even our friends,  \\n wouldn't it make sense to do something similar  \\n for expensive work projects?  \\n In developing your business analysis plan,  \\n you have to decide how requirements will be traced  \\n to ensure they're all delivered and approved.  \\n You'll do this by determining a Traceability Approach  \\n and using a Traceability Matrix.  \\n The Traceability Approach  \\n is a way of thinking about how requirements are related  \\n and tracking them.  \\n The project team  \\n should be able to trace a single requirement  \\n to its supporting objectives and other related requirements.  \\n The Traceability Approach also allows  \\n for the visibility of progress on individual requirements.  \\n It clearly exposes obstacles  \\n that are preventing requirements from progressing.  \\n Appropriate actions can then be taken  \\n to remove those obstacles.  \\n The Traceability Matrix  \\n is how you use the Traceability Approach  \\n to track your project.  \\n It's a tool you actually use.  \\n You might have seen this before  \\n in the form of a task board, in Scrum, or Kanban board.  \\n What you do is arrange a few columns  \\n with titles that represent the status of the requirements.  \\n Typically the columns are labeled,  \\n To do, In progress and Done.  \\n Now, the In progress column could be further subdivided  \\n to show phases of the organization's methodology,  \\n including maybe analysis, design, development, tests, etc.  \\n On these physical boards,  \\n the connections between requirements and objectives  \\n are visualized by sticky notes  \\n and move between defined columns.  \\n These are extraordinarily helpful,  \\n but a Traceability Matrix is a digital document  \\n used to not just visualize the progress,  \\n but to consolidate all of your documentation in one place.  \\n You can understand the current status  \\n of individual requirements  \\n and link to other important documents.  \\n These may include use cases, analysis models,  \\n design documents, test plans, cases and results,  \\n acceptance sign offs are also often included.  \\n The more detailed Traceability Matrix often has a space  \\n dedicated to linking high level requirements,  \\n also referred to as features or epics,  \\n to smaller user stories.  \\n They can also connect each requirement  \\n to the corresponding business and project objectives.  \\n The Traceability Matrix should act as a single source  \\n to connect all project requirement documentation.  \\n You can use the matrix  \\n to assess the impact of changes to requirements  \\n and the overall project scope.  \\n This assessment allows changes  \\n to be addressed and quantified  \\n from a risk, cost or time perspective.  \\n As new requirements are approved,  \\n they're added to the Traceability Matrix.  \\n You trace them as they are implemented.  \\n Now, the amount of detail you include  \\n is dependent on the size, complexity  \\n and importance of the project.  \\n Also note that you can certainly have a task board as well,  \\n but the Traceability Matrix  \\n acts as the central hub for information.  \\n Use the Traceability Matrix as your primary tool  \\n for tracking your efforts, improving communication  \\n and clarifying your progress.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2916002\",\"duration\":173,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Change control\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_07_02_MM30_change\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Identify importance of requirements change control.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2627213,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

Interviewing is a formal term used in business analysis  \\n for a requirements conversation,  \\n a conversation about what's changing due to a process,  \\n system, or policy change for example.  \\n Requirements conversation and interviews  \\n are one of many techniques to gather, discover, elicit,  \\n and learn information from a person or group of people.  \\n Without these conversations  \\n and analysis of what you learn from them,  \\n people are often left with confusion, rework, and gaps,  \\n systems and processes that don't work,  \\n and plain frustration.  \\n These conversations and interviews  \\n are the most common techniques used to elicit requirements  \\n and help teams plan for implementing changes.  \\n It can be very helpful in discovering needed information  \\n and enable you in building  \\n positive stakeholder relationships.  \\n If you're like most,  \\n you spend a lot of your time having these conversations  \\n and you're looking for some ways  \\n to make the most of this critical technique.  \\n To use your stakeholders' precious time efficiently,  \\n you will need to ensure that you prepare,  \\n plan, execute, and follow up.  \\n These conversations have a lot of strategic elements  \\n that when used correctly,  \\n can create better results for the organization  \\n and maximize your impact as part of the team.  \\n There are four things to help make your interviews  \\n and conversations for requirements successful.  \\n First, your preparation and experience.  \\n Next, ensuring you're talking with the right people,  \\n and the willingness and readiness of the participants  \\n to provide detailed information.  \\n And last, the relationship and rapport  \\n that you build with your stakeholders.  \\n When considering if this is the right technique to use,  \\n there are some key things to keep in mind.  \\n First, some strengths.  \\n These conversations allow a very focused dialogue  \\n at any level of detail,  \\n context and big picture or details.  \\n Also, they allow those being involved  \\n to express feelings, opinions, and thoughts  \\n in a more private environment.  \\n And last, it's a really great way  \\n to establish and build relationships.  \\n There are also a few key challenges  \\n that you should consider.  \\n First, it's rather difficult  \\n and takes great skill to do these conversations well.  \\n The result can also be misinterpreted by the participant.  \\n Also, some participants may withhold critical information,  \\n intentionally or not.  \\n And overall, it can be quite time consuming  \\n to prepare, conduct, and follow up  \\n with as many people as you'd like.  \\n Requirements conversations and interviews  \\n are a critical part of your requirements toolbox.  \\n With good practice, you'll soon be on your way  \\n to using this technique to its full potential.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4521477\",\"duration\":222,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Use interviews and conversations to elicit requirements\",\"fileName\":\"4490066_en_US_01_02_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"TK01. rollbacks noted in storyboard\",\"handoutNotes\":\"Exercise Files > Project Types and Conversation Rationale.pdf\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":359,\"exerciseFileDisplayText\":\"Exercise Files > Project Types and Conversation Rationale.pdf\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"This video covers why interviews and conversations are an important part of the toolkit when eliciting requirements.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":10568732,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Requirements conversations help us build  \\n powerful relationships with stakeholders and user groups.  \\n This absolutely is critical to success  \\n when changing systems and business processes.  \\n These conversations can help us  \\n with things like understanding the problem  \\n or opportunity of the project or requested change  \\n and connecting pieces of important context,  \\n big picture, and details.  \\n Also, building relationships.  \\n And last, understanding the potential solution  \\n from each person's unique perspective.  \\n Now, there may be different people to meet with on a project  \\n and depending on the situation and the context,  \\n so let's look at some common roles you'll likely talk to  \\n and why you might meet with each of them.  \\n First, the sponsor.  \\n The sponsor of the project is the business leader  \\n accountable for the change.  \\n They're often interviewed and talked to  \\n to understand the problem or opportunity  \\n from a business leadership perspective.  \\n You'll likely meet with them to understand  \\n how the project aligns to higher level goals, objectives,  \\n and strategies of the organization.  \\n Another role you'll talk to are the leaders and managers  \\n of the areas impacted  \\n as they have a unique perspective to the problem  \\n and opportunity for their area of responsibility.  \\n You'll also likely meet with the users of the solution.  \\n They have key insight into the problems and opportunities,  \\n and yet have another unique perspective  \\n that leaders and sponsors may not be aware of.  \\n These users often have all kinds of frustrations  \\n and ideas for how to improve the process and solution.  \\n Since they're the ones using the solution, we need to ensure  \\n that whatever we develop will meet their needs  \\n along with the leaders' and sponsors' needs.  \\n Finally, the subject matter experts of the solution, system,  \\n process, or product you're working on.  \\n The subject matter expert,  \\n or sometimes referred to as SMEs or SMEs,  \\n they have detailed information about the customer,  \\n the business or system domain,  \\n and they can connect information from users and leaders  \\n that might not otherwise be easily connected.  \\n You'll need their perspective that contains a deeper level  \\n of knowledge about the product or solution as a whole.  \\n Sometimes our subject matter experts and users  \\n and leaders as well can be the same person.  \\n The roles might overlap.  \\n It's a delicate role to show your value  \\n beyond gathering requirements and taking notes.  \\n Your role is to make the change work for everybody involved,  \\n not just give somebody what they ask for.  \\n Often the solution given by a leader  \\n is only part of the technical solution,  \\n and this can cause unintended errors  \\n if we don't fully understand the need in context.  \\n There are also other options and alternatives  \\n that might work to solve for the problem,  \\n and they might actually be more cost effective, faster,  \\n or not impact other user groups in a negative way.  \\n It's your role to dig in  \\n and understand what the underlying need is  \\n and ensure the solution is complete  \\n and will not negatively impact other users.  \\n Now that you know who to talk to and why,  \\n you'll need to understand your unique project type  \\n and how it provides additional context  \\n to your interviewing conversations.  \\n Use the exercise file provided  \\n to guide you through some sample project types  \\n and interviewing rationale.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4521478\",\"duration\":164,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Overview of the requirements conversation process\",\"fileName\":\"4490066_en_US_01_03_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"TK01. rollbacks noted in storyboard\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":525,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"This video provides an overview of preparing, conducting, and following up on interviews and conversations and the importance of each part.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":6966613,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

 \\n These types of things will help you start to understand  \\n how they fit into the project  \\n and what their attitude about the project might be.  \\n Also, consider the organizational politics  \\n that you need to be aware of.  \\n The second area is what their relationship is  \\n to the project.  \\n Understanding their role in relationship to the project  \\n is looking into things like,  \\n have they voiced any opinions about the project,  \\n positive or negative,  \\n or additionally, you may want to look into things like,  \\n how does the project likely impact them or their team?  \\n What's in it for them  \\n to support this project and participate?  \\n The third area is about them personally.  \\n Knowing a bit about their personality, work style,  \\n and some personal things will help you connect better.  \\n Are they a relationship person?  \\n Are they data-driven, or more of a just-do-it person?  \\n This helps you know how much time to spend  \\n on getting to know them  \\n versus getting straight to the point.  \\n Do they have common hobbies, family,  \\n or related friends and family to the organization?

 \\n - Oh, I'm good.  \\n You know, I could totally relate to that.  \\n Besides the online records project we're working on,  \\n I'm also working on the claims update project.  \\n - Oh yeah, Melissa's been working on that one.  \\n Have you spoken with her?

 \\n I want to hear it straight from you.  \\n - Okay.  \\n Well, you know, we're looking to continue  \\n to improve the online medical records for our team  \\n and patients, and we'd like  \\n to see the patients use the self-service more  \\n and this will decrease the volume  \\n in our customer service area.  \\n This is a strategy that we've been doing  \\n and it's a great opportunity for us,  \\n but there have been some areas we're worried about  \\n and we just want to keep the momentum  \\n moving in the right direction.  \\n - Yeah, that makes sense.  \\n Thanks for sharing.  \\n It sounds like you've had some ideas on  \\n how to accomplish some of this.  \\n I'm really hoping that you and I can dig into more  \\n so we can truly accomplish your intended goals.  \\n - Yeah, absolutely.  \\n What do you need to know?  \\n - Well, I really want to understand this  \\n from your perspective and your vision.  \\n It'll really help me connect the other teams  \\n and prepare for upcoming meetings that I'm having.  \\n So why don't we start off with  \\n what does success look like from your perspective,  \\n a patient's perspective  \\n and any other perspective you can share?  \\n - Well, I'm working with Joe in the call center  \\n and he wants to convert the patient's phone inquiries  \\n to online self-service,  \\n as well as leverage AI in that process to help.  \\n Right now, people are calling in  \\n and saying it's a lot easier to call than it is  \\n to get the information online.  \\n And this is just an area of confusion  \\n and obviously a concern for us.  \\n We really need to improve this  \\n and make self-service valuable to the patients.  \\n - Got it, okay.  \\n So patients are trying  \\n to use the online portal and they want to use it,  \\n but it's just too frustrating for them  \\n and they end up calling in instead?  \\n - Exactly, yeah.  \\n - Ah, okay.  \\n All right, well the good news is  \\n that we're here to fix this, right?  \\n - Yeah.  \\n - Well, I think this project started a year  \\n and a half ago with the same mission,  \\n and it seems like the first time we tried  \\n we really missed the mark,  \\n and we only met the technical need in scope,  \\n but we didn't really deliver on the patient behavior  \\n results we were looking for.  \\n What do you see as the biggest risks?  \\n - Well, you know,  \\n for me the biggest risk is that we  \\n continue to frustrate patients.  \\n Right now they're using the site  \\n and I don't want them to give up on us.  \\n - Oh, that's understandable.  \\n So how would you measure success then for this project?  \\n - More of the patients  \\n that are logging in successfully getting what they need.  \\n I want to see the ones that we frustrated in the past  \\n and I want to convert them over to using the online site.  \\n - Right, so it sounds like we really need  \\n to put a high priority on usability  \\n and the patient experience.  \\n - Yes.  \\n - Okay, thanks for that.  \\n I would love to gather some data  \\n that tells us exactly what's happening to users  \\n as they use the online portal.  \\n Things like where they're dropping off in their user  \\n experience and what's likely frustrating them.  \\n I can work with the data analytics team  \\n to research what's happening with the user experience,  \\n and also work with them to predict when a user is likely  \\n to abandon their online experience.  \\n There may also be ways we can predict  \\n and prescribe actions to the user.  \\n If we can model it out with this,  \\n we can look at possible solutions  \\n that will improve all of this.  \\n We can model these solutions and test out some options.  \\n Who on your team would you like us to work with  \\n as we investigate and explore this data  \\n and these various options?

 \\n And what would your objective be in meeting with them?  \\n What research might you do ahead of time,  \\n and what questions would you likely start out with  \\n in your plan to talk to them?  \\n Take a pause and work through this.  \\n I promise it's worth thinking through.  \\n Okay, great.  \\n Let's move on to the second scenario.  \\n You've been asked to help out  \\n on some enhancement requests  \\n for the customer facing website that customers use  \\n to review their medical claim information.  \\n The current website was implemented about six months ago  \\n and has a long backlog of enhancement requests.  \\n You've been given two specific enhancements to work on  \\n by the project manager,  \\n and a list of names  \\n of who you should talk to about requirements.  \\n The project manager has given you  \\n the names of the web self-service manager,  \\n the customer service manager,  \\n as well as the director of customer service.  \\n Who would you meet with first  \\n and what would your objective be in meeting with them?

 \\n My answer is the sponsor, and why I chose the sponsor is  \\n because it would be critical  \\n to understand why the sponsor picked this package software  \\n and what he is looking for in a package software.  \\n Understanding the sponsor's goals  \\n and vision is critical to determining how  \\n to approach the users next.  \\n With this info, then I'm ready  \\n to prep and meet with the others.  \\n Next, the meeting objective.  \\n My answer is to understand the goals  \\n and vision of their business operations  \\n with this new software  \\n and the why behind the package software.  \\n And last, what questions would I likely start with?  \\n I'd start with things like what does success look like  \\n and what would happen if we don't go through  \\n with the package software implementation?  \\n Who would benefit most and how?  \\n What led you to this specific package software  \\n and how would you measure success?  \\n Also, what risks do you see are the biggest  \\n risks to this project?  \\n Great, now let's look at scenario two.  \\n It's about the website enhancements  \\n to view medical claim information.  \\n Who would you meet with first?  \\n Well, my answer to this one is  \\n the Director of Customer Service.  \\n I chose them because I'll need to understand the context  \\n of the last six months  \\n and how these two enhancements connect  \\n to the bigger picture, other enhancement requests  \\n and the current issues the customer service team is facing.  \\n This will then help me meet with the others.  \\n My objective is to understand the context  \\n and why these two are the most important  \\n enhancements at this time.  \\n My questions, what pain points are we trying to alleviate  \\n with these two enhancements,  \\n and how will you know  \\n that we've implemented them successfully?  \\n Also, I'd ask,  \\n who will benefit most from these enhancements?  \\n Okay, scenario three, the audit operations project.  \\n I chose the Operations Manager or General Manager.  \\n My objective in meeting with them is  \\n to understand the pain points  \\n and goals of the automation efforts.  \\n The questions that I chose.  \\n What does success look like  \\n and what pain points are we trying to alleviate?  \\n What teams or areas is your team dependent on,  \\n and what teams or areas are dependent on your team?  \\n Also, I'd ask, what parts of your operation are repeatable,  \\n high volume, and maybe good candidates for automation?  \\n One of the biggest mistakes we can make in requirement  \\n solicitation is to dive into the details  \\n before understanding the context and big picture.  \\n When this happens, we often and unknowingly go  \\n after the wrong details.  \\n Remember our online medical record example,  \\n the project has been spending precious time  \\n and money on details that were not creating the  \\n needed business outcomes.  \\n The value of the users converting  \\n to the online system was not originally met.  \\n In all of these examples, we are setting up the context  \\n so when we get to the details,  \\n we're going in the right direction.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4522470\",\"duration\":131,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge 2: Identify what went wrong\",\"fileName\":\"4490066_en_US_03_08_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"There are two files: author and screencap.

You've probably heard about active listening before  \\n and how it's about paraphrasing  \\n what you hear from others in your own words.  \\n But what does this mean to requirement solicitation  \\n and talking with stakeholders?  \\n Well, when eliciting requirements,  \\n it's largely about restating stated requirements  \\n into actual requirements.  \\n A stated requirement is what the stakeholder says they want.  \\n An actual requirement is what the stakeholder actually needs  \\n and is in a language the team can work with.  \\n Plain language without technical terms is best.  \\n It's not always easy to get from one to the other,  \\n but I'd like to share some examples and thoughts  \\n to help evolve your active-listening skills  \\n in the context of requirements.  \\n Just like other areas of life and relationships,  \\n it's important to actively listen  \\n by not just hearing the words,  \\n but listening for the underlying intent.  \\n In requirements,  \\n these underlying intents need to be drawn out  \\n with deep questioning, listening, and probing questions.  \\n Imagine the following scenario.  \\n You're discussing enhancements to a software application  \\n with a stakeholder,  \\n and they say,  \\n \\\"I need a button on the left side of the screen  \\n \\\"that says Submit.\\\"  \\n Now, this is a stated requirement,  \\n but the actual requirement?  \\n Well, that's a mystery at this point.  \\n So I'm going to reply with something like,  \\n \\\"Okay, so let me make sure I understand.  \\n \\\"You need to be able to send the order  \\n \\\"once you've completed  \\n \\\"entering the order pricing information.  \\n \\\"Did I get that right?\\\"  \\n The stakeholder then either agrees  \\n and confirms my paraphrasing into an actual requirement  \\n or corrects my understanding of what the user's trying to do  \\n and provides more information.  \\n So listening for actual requirements that are unstated,  \\n it's difficult,  \\n and this is where active listening comes in.  \\n Active listening is 100% focused on the other person  \\n and what they're trying to communicate  \\n rather than what their exact words are.  \\n Our stakeholders,  \\n they don't understand what good requirements sound like.  \\n We have to reframe what they say  \\n to get to good requirements.  \\n We use active listening and our requirements skills  \\n to do this.  \\n It's listening for the pain  \\n and for what the user is trying to do and solve for  \\n as they talk about the solutions,  \\n and it's listening for  \\n the actions and scenarios users perform  \\n rather than the technical things they say and imagine.  \\n When we're not actively listening,  \\n we're having an internal dialogue  \\n with our own inner voice,  \\n and perhaps we're designing potential solutions  \\n to fix the problem.  \\n Or maybe there's a lot going on in the room  \\n and you're easily distracted.  \\n Or perhaps you're even thinking about  \\n what your next question is  \\n and worried about getting all your questions in  \\n before the time is up.  \\n These are all super normal,  \\n normal types of things and responses when listening.  \\n All of us can easily get caught up  \\n in our own inner dialogue and distractions.  \\n It's important to develop awareness  \\n of when this is happening  \\n so you can slip back  \\n and focus on the other person  \\n and their stated and unstated requirements.  \\n Practicing active listening  \\n and developing self-awareness is a skill  \\n that will enhance your conversation skills greatly.  \\n With analysis and requirements,  \\n this means listening for unstated and actual requirements.  \\n In your next requirements discussion,  \\n practice this unique lens on requirements listening  \\n and see what happens.  \\n I think you'll see great progress  \\n on high quality requirements.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4521483\",\"duration\":192,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Take notes during a requirements elicitation conversation\",\"fileName\":\"4490066_en_US_03_13_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"TK01. rollbacks noted in storyboard\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":410,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"This video explains approaches for taking notes during a requirements elicitation interview or conversation.

 \\n Well, here are some options to consider.  \\n First, old-fashioned note-taking.  \\n This can actually work quite well.  \\n Another option is to use a whiteboard,  \\n where you and the participants can both contribute  \\n to key lists, diagrams, visuals,  \\n action items, and decisions made.  \\n One of my favorite go-to approaches for capturing details  \\n is to prepare for the dialogue with a visual model diagram  \\n or other framework.  \\n So, for example,  \\n if I'm talking to a subject matter expert  \\n on the process that she follows,  \\n I'll create a high-level picture of the process,  \\n and then below it,  \\n I'll create space for each step in the process,  \\n and its people, exceptions, systems, and current issues.  \\n I'll come to the meeting with this framework blank,  \\n or perhaps just the high-level process steps filled in,  \\n and we'll complete the rest as we chat.  \\n I really hope these ideas give you all kinds of reasons  \\n to break out of the traditional note-taking mold  \\n and get better interviewing conversation results.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4522471\",\"duration\":142,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Ending the conversation\",\"fileName\":\"4490066_en_US_03_14_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"TK01. rollbacks noted in storyboard\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":166,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"This video demonstrates how to best wrap up a requirements conversation.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":6770914,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Requirements, conversations that end in a flurry,  \\n they're a risk.  \\n A risk to your reputation  \\n and the project results.  \\n Make sure you have a plan and stick to it.  \\n Plan time appropriately to end the conversation.  \\n To ensure stakeholders are comfortable with our progress,  \\n we need to end the conversation with confidence,  \\n next steps, and appreciation.  \\n Without this, stakeholders leave the room feeling uneasy,  \\n frustrated, and may talk behind your back,  \\n creating unneeded conflict and drama for the project.  \\n I would like to go over some tips on ending the conversation  \\n with comfort and ease.  \\n First, make sure you keep your eye on the clock  \\n and save time at the end of the conversation as well.  \\n I would rather decide with the others  \\n to schedule another block of time than rush  \\n through the agenda, thinking everything got covered.  \\n During the last 10 minutes,  \\n review and summarize what was covered.  \\n You may also want to review the key points, decisions made  \\n and next steps with everyone.  \\n I also like to ask what remains lingering in their minds.  \\n This simple yet powerful technique helps you see  \\n how their mindset has evolved throughout the conversation.  \\n When you are able to evolve the other's mindset,  \\n you're showing your value in the process  \\n As a follow-up to what lingers,  \\n I like to ask, \\\"What concerns  \\n or risk are they thinking about?\\\"  \\n This shows you really care about their concerns  \\n and are not just trying to get through your agenda.  \\n This question also helps provide more context to emphasize  \\n and understand the stakeholder's point of view.  \\n Next, once you understand where their mindset is,  \\n you'll need to quickly determine if more time is needed.  \\n You can ask them if they think more time would be helpful  \\n to explore certain topics.  \\n You can agree on a rough date  \\n and an amount of time needed with them.  \\n Last but not least, review the items to follow up on  \\n with each person, including scheduling any follow up  \\n meetings and when they can expect to hear from you next.  \\n And of course, don't forget to thank them  \\n for their time.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

Throughout the world organizations use models and modeling  \\n as a cost effective way to share and demonstrate  \\n the concepts and designs to larger audiences to receive  \\n feedback on what is to come.  \\n You may know this as prototyping.  \\n Organizations use business process modeling tools  \\n in the same way to determine  \\n what is being performed today in our current state  \\n and what is planned as the expected future state.  \\n Process modeling captures the interrelationships  \\n between the people, processes, activities,  \\n and systems in delivering the expected outcome.  \\n I want to share with you the four most commonly used  \\n business modeling tools at a high level overview.  \\n The first tool is referred to as the Context Diagram.  \\n The context diagram provides the high level framework  \\n and interaction of an organization.  \\n The context diagram depicts the organization  \\n that has been analyzed as shown as a circle.  \\n The external entities that connect  \\n to the area or system being analyzed, represented by boxes.  \\n And lastly, the relationship of interactions  \\n between the organization and the external entities.  \\n These are shown as the arrows.  \\n Our focus here are the interrelationships and activities  \\n that are either initiated or needed by the organization.  \\n We now arrive at our next diagram  \\n the Functional Flow Diagram.  \\n The functional flow diagram is a simple model showing  \\n the functional areas or stakeholders internally  \\n to our organization and how they interact in a logical  \\n overall flow of work.  \\n The functional flow diagram always starts  \\n with a stakeholder, usually the customer or another entity  \\n external to the organization, initiating a transaction.  \\n Stakeholders and internal functional areas  \\n are captured in the ovals.  \\n Then, the appropriate relationships and workflows are drawn  \\n between these stakeholder groups.  \\n As we continue our journey down in to the next level  \\n of detail, we start creating Cross-Functional Flow Diagrams  \\n as a way to capture and sequentially display  \\n the activities that are performed.  \\n Cross-functional flow diagrams also referred  \\n to as activity diagrams, and swimlane diagrams.  \\n The stakeholders also referred to as actors in the process.  \\n Remembering an actor can be a person,  \\n system or functional area.  \\n These diagrams organize activity sequences that displays  \\n the process in the context of the actors responsible  \\n for performing the work.  \\n This added structure makes it very easy to read and quickly  \\n identifies the individual actors work  \\n as well as cross-functional interactions needed.  \\n These diagrams are very effective in visually sharing  \\n a process is performed from start to finish,  \\n and what each and every stakeholder or actor needs  \\n to perform to enable completion of the activity.  \\n Finally, we come to the fourth type of model  \\n known as process flow charting.  \\n These traditional process flow models  \\n show the sequential flow of activities, decision points,  \\n and other interactions.  \\n Process Flow models are used as a way to capture  \\n the step by step procedures and activities performed  \\n by an individual actor.  \\n These processes describe who and what has to be involved  \\n in fully responding to an event, or how people  \\n in the enterprise collaborate to achieve a goal.  \\n These process workflow models are the low level detail  \\n not represented in the cross functional swimlane models.  \\n By visually starting with the big picture,  \\n we cascade into finer detail and create the fourth business  \\n process modeling diagrams.  \\n The context diagram, the functional flow diagram,  \\n the cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n and the process flowchart.  \\n These four business process models should now form the basis  \\n of your business process modeling toolbox.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2330908\",\"duration\":191,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Modeling consistency and standards\",\"fileName\":\"490754_00_04_MM30_Modeling_2020Q2\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, discover the most commonly used modeling symbols, best practices, and international standards.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2903197,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Have you ever tried taking a different way home  \\n only to find that you run into delays  \\n that you didn't expect?  \\n The same is true when you try to maintain  \\n consistency in modeling.  \\n Using standard is a great way to achieve the safest  \\n and fastest way home.  \\n There are a number of internationally recognized  \\n modeling standards that your organization may wish  \\n to align with.  \\n The two most commonly used are UML,  \\n Unified Modeling Language, and BPMN,  \\n Business Process Modeling Notation.  \\n Both of these standards explain how you define  \\n process levels, grouping of processes,  \\n labeling standards, and annotations.  \\n Every organization is different so be sure you check  \\n with your organization before starting  \\n any modeling activities.  \\n Consistency and simplicity are the keys to ensuring  \\n effective capture, analysis, and presentation  \\n of your efforts.  \\n Business process modeling should leverage a consistent  \\n modeling approach and symbol set that enables  \\n an easy to read picture of the work  \\n that is being performed and the workflow between  \\n the functional areas performing them.  \\n It also helps us to better understand the process  \\n in achieving the outcome and identify  \\n the additional information that is needed,  \\n together laying the foundation for other models  \\n which will offer additional details and document  \\n important aspects of the areas being analyzed.  \\n And finally to represent the current state  \\n and potentially define the future state to enable  \\n the gaps to be easily compared in a consistent format.  \\n There are many tools and techniques that can be used  \\n to capture the information you need  \\n for your business process diagrams.  \\n These all vary depending on what stage  \\n you're at in your documentation, which diagram  \\n you're developing, and who is your audience.  \\n There also needs to be a level of consistency  \\n in the approach to creating effective process models.  \\n A few of these techniques include training  \\n your process modelers in the standards and formats  \\n which have been agreed and understood by many  \\n across the organization, explain process modeling  \\n to the business attendees so they too understand  \\n the purpose and benefits of each of the models used  \\n and more importantly when to use them.  \\n Check to see if there have been any earlier work performed  \\n in the area you are modeling.  \\n Why repeat work if it's already exists?  \\n And start with the known and then iteratively add detail  \\n as they come to hand.  \\n This is a great way to ensure owners of the process  \\n share their perception of reality, which is not always  \\n the way the business is designed to perform.  \\n When you come to documenting your diagrams,  \\n there are a number of readily available  \\n software applications that can support this kind of mapping.  \\n The most common or professionally preferred  \\n is Microsoft Visio.  \\n This tool is perfect for cross-functional flow  \\n and flow chart process maps.  \\n However, if you're creating context diagrams  \\n or functional flow diagrams, presentation software  \\n is just as good.  \\n So before you start out on your next process  \\n modeling journey, leverage your organization's standards  \\n and practices to help avoid those wrong turns  \\n and pitfalls and find the most efficient path  \\n to your front door.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Introduction\",\"size\":11122206,\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentChapter:2335085\"},{\"duration\":933,\"entries\":[{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2331552\",\"duration\":215,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"The purpose of the context diagram\",\"fileName\":\"490754_01_01_MM30_Purpose_2020Q2\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about when you would use a context diagram.

- Have you ever been in a situation  \\n where you've had to make a decision quickly  \\n or had someone call to you from in another room  \\n and ask you a question like,  \\n \\\"Can we make the change now?\\\"  \\n What is it that they want to change and why?  \\n Before you can answer this seemingly simple question,  \\n you need to ensure you understand the context.  \\n The same is true if you need to analyze  \\n a business unit or an organization.  \\n Before you can delve into the detail  \\n of what an organization does, or more importantly,  \\n make or suggest changes,  \\n you first need to understand where and how  \\n the organization fits into the big picture of things.  \\n The context diagram provides a visual view  \\n of how the organization fits within the outside world  \\n and is viewed at the highest level.  \\n In a way it becomes the checklist for future analysis  \\n as each component can be analyzed by drilling down  \\n into other detail.  \\n The context diagram is the perfect at-a-glance tool  \\n to show where the organization fits  \\n in the greater scheme of things.  \\n Every organization interacts with external entities.  \\n These external entities are represented  \\n by the boxes in the diagram.  \\n They may include the customer, suppliers,  \\n banks, contractors, and so on.  \\n They're essentially any external entity,  \\n the organization shares a relationship with.  \\n These relationships are shown  \\n by the interactions coming into or from the organization.  \\n In the example, we see that the customer  \\n places a purchase order against the organization.  \\n The organization sends the products  \\n and invoice back to the customer.  \\n And the customer then makes payment to the organization.  \\n The organization deposits the money into the bank and so on.  \\n A context diagram is a tool that can be used  \\n in a number of situations.  \\n It's a great way to understand the relationship  \\n the organization has between the various external entities.  \\n This high level knowledge enables you  \\n to identify any significant impacts  \\n that a change through an organization may have  \\n and the way they interact with the outside world.  \\n By providing context around  \\n how the organization interacts externally,  \\n you can then start to build an understanding  \\n of the functions required within the organization  \\n to support these interactions.  \\n Another great use for a context diagram  \\n is when explaining the scope of a project  \\n and how it fits in within the organization.  \\n Let's say you're working on a billing system.  \\n A system context diagram can communicate  \\n to your stakeholders how the new system will interact  \\n with the various internal business units  \\n and external business partners, if any.  \\n When using this tool to communicate to key stakeholders,  \\n they can quickly identify the relationships  \\n that need to change.  \\n These changes become the scope and analysis  \\n of what needs to be performed as part of the project.  \\n If you're someone new to the organization,  \\n creating a context diagram is a great way for you  \\n to quickly gain an understanding of the organization  \\n and how it interacts.  \\n In fact, it's a great starting point  \\n with any analysis you need to do.  \\n Context diagrams are wonderful visual modeling techniques  \\n that provide the overall view of the area  \\n in which you'll be interacting with  \\n and how it all fits together.  \\n So next time you're asked a simple question  \\n on whether or not you can make the change,  \\n creating and understanding the context  \\n will enable you to make a better  \\n and more informed decision.  \\n

Ask any great photographer,  \\n and they'll tell you that you need certain building blocks  \\n to create an awesome shot.  \\n Lighting, structure, depth, a good subject matter,  \\n and a moment in time  \\n that they wish to capture through their lens.  \\n Photographers also use different lenses  \\n for different distances and expected detail.  \\n Context diagrams represent the overall panoramic photograph  \\n depicting the highest level.  \\n The following definitions assist  \\n in framing the context diagram.  \\n Context.  \\n How a business area, system, process,  \\n organizational area being analyzed,  \\n interacts with the world.  \\n Actor.  \\n A person, department, or system  \\n that is directly involved  \\n with the business area being analyzed.  \\n External entity.  \\n A person, department, organization, or system  \\n that interacts with the business area,  \\n but is not being analyzed.  \\n They can be the source or destination of data  \\n outside of the system.  \\n Analysis considers only the inputs or outputs,  \\n but does not review the external entity's processes  \\n or systems.  \\n Context diagrams also leverage three common components,  \\n or building blocks.  \\n Entities,  \\n relationships,  \\n and processes.  \\n All of which are needed in creating that perfect,  \\n high-level diagram.  \\n Entities are the elements or actors  \\n that represent each player  \\n that fits within the context of the diagram.  \\n They can be shown in any way that provides clarity  \\n and helps the reader identify them easily.  \\n It's not uncommon to see these entities represented  \\n and labeled in boxes.  \\n Within those boxes you may find ovals, stick figures,  \\n or even graphics of paper art,  \\n as long as it fits within the message you wish to convey.  \\n However, when creating a context diagram  \\n for the organization you're analyzing,  \\n you would use a circle to represent the main entity,  \\n and use boxes around the outside  \\n to represent the external entities.  \\n A circle is used as it indicates what you have control of.  \\n In this case, what goes on internal to your organization  \\n lives inside the circle,  \\n whereas a box indicates  \\n what your organization only has an influence over.  \\n It's all very well and good  \\n to have all the entities identified,  \\n but what really provides the context we are looking for  \\n are the relationships between each of them.  \\n This is done with arrows or flows.  \\n The flows represent the relationship  \\n between the two entities.  \\n The direction of the flow  \\n indicates whether the interaction is incoming or outgoing.  \\n These flows represent activities  \\n that the analyzing organization must perform  \\n and adhere to to ensure smooth interactions  \\n that pass between the two entities.  \\n One entity is sending an activity,  \\n also known as an output,  \\n and one is receiving the activity.  \\n And these are called inputs.  \\n Good modeling standards dictate that each relationship  \\n starts from one entity and finishes at another.  \\n The customer flows here clearly show  \\n incoming and outgoing interactions  \\n between the customer and the organization.  \\n These are the processes needed in achieving  \\n the expected outcome of the external entity.  \\n Each arrow represents the flow of information, data,  \\n products, artifacts being sent between the organization  \\n and the external entity.  \\n These flows should be labeled to provide further context.  \\n Always remember to keep your context diagram  \\n at the highest level.  \\n Rather than having a flow for each interaction,  \\n you can simplify your diagram  \\n by listing all the types of interactions on a single flow.  \\n These single flows represent the process.  \\n These processes can each be analyzed separately  \\n and drilled down to into more detail  \\n when you create your functional flow diagram.  \\n So just like framing that perfect photograph,  \\n the best context diagrams are simple, clear,  \\n uncluttered, and usually fit on one page.  \\n By utilizing the three fundamental features  \\n of a context diagram, entities, relationships,  \\n and processes,  \\n you start your business process modeling  \\n at the highest level,  \\n and creates the foundation for future  \\n and more detailed analysis.  \\n Context diagrams are the pictures  \\n in which the organization fits with the outside world,  \\n and becomes the diagram  \\n that is worth more than a thousand words.  \\n

fits in the big picture,  \\n you first need to do some research.  \\n You can research the organization on the intranet,  \\n ask colleagues a lot of questions,  \\n or run a series of workshops  \\n with key people with business knowledge.  \\n In my experience, all of the above are great ways  \\n to begin building your knowledge  \\n and validate your context diagram.  \\n The important thing is to remember  \\n that this is the start of our business process modeling.  \\n We need to keep it simple and high level.  \\n As a rule of thumb, you should start with a single page.  \\n Why?  \\n Well, having a single page forces you  \\n to keep your diagram at the highest level.  \\n There's a tendency to dive into the detail  \\n and try and fit in too much information.  \\n If you find your page needs to be really big  \\n to fit everything in,  \\n then you're probably overcomplicating it  \\n and need to pull yourself back out of the detail.  \\n Start with the main entity that you wish  \\n to provide the context for  \\n by drawing a circle in the middle of the page  \\n with its name inside the circle.  \\n All interactions with the external entities will stem in  \\n and out from the circle.  \\n Remembering a circle is used to indicate  \\n what you have control over,  \\n what and how things happen within the organization.  \\n From your research and discussions,  \\n begin to add all the external stakeholders  \\n around the outside of the circle.  \\n As they are external to your organization,  \\n you will place them in a box.  \\n Each box will represent a single entity  \\n that interacts with the organization.  \\n Throughout the analysis,  \\n you'll become aware of more external entities.  \\n These can be added as you go.  \\n Remember, a box is used to represent entities  \\n where your organization only has influence over.  \\n An example of influence may be the ability  \\n to negotiate an agreement.  \\n You may need them to adapt to your needs, for instance,  \\n having them use a template supplied by your organization  \\n or complying with secure electronic bank standards.  \\n Not having control essentially means having  \\n to work within the constraints and constrictions imposed  \\n by their entity, such as legislation,  \\n regulations, industry and international standards.  \\n As you identify and place the external entities  \\n onto your diagram,  \\n begin to connect the relationships that occur  \\n between each external entity and your organization  \\n by drawing one directional arrow  \\n either coming or leaving the organization.  \\n Using the right angles  \\n for the relationship flows simplifies the diagram  \\n and enables greater area to label the flows.  \\n Then label the flows with what interactions are taking place  \\n and whether they are incoming or outgoing.  \\n Incoming relationship flows trigger the start  \\n of an internal activity within your organization.  \\n Once you have drafted your context diagram,  \\n it's essential to validate your analysis.  \\n Share the diagrams with others in the organization  \\n in seeking their view of who and what is involved.  \\n By keeping them in the loop,  \\n you give them the comfort of knowing that their processes  \\n and relationships are being included for further analysis  \\n and ensures you don't miss out on that all important entity,  \\n the one you forgot to capture.  \\n

place.  \\n As always with diagrams, there are risks in subverting  \\n too much from reality by leaving important things out  \\n or focusing so much on trying to include everything  \\n that the diagram loses part of its value  \\n by being too complex.  \\n I want to share a few pitfalls that you can easily fall into  \\n when creating context diagrams.  \\n The most common is getting too detailed.  \\n Rather than having a flow for each interaction,  \\n you can simplify your diagram  \\n by listing all types of interactions on a single flow.  \\n These are called processes.  \\n These processes can each be analyzed separately  \\n and drilled down to in more detail  \\n when we create the next level of detail  \\n in the functional flow diagram.  \\n Let's take an example of an organization  \\n that has the bulk of its IT operations done overseas.  \\n If we were to mention every single overseas partner,  \\n the diagram would be difficult to read  \\n and would not create an easy at-a-glance view.  \\n Let's take a closer look at this example.  \\n Here, the organization has partnered  \\n with multiple external offshore businesses  \\n responsible for all the IT operational support  \\n for the organization.  \\n They have partnerships in Manila, India, Philippines,  \\n just to mention a few.  \\n As the information that needs to flow  \\n to the external provider,  \\n the delivered outcome from the external provider  \\n is the same.  \\n All entities can be grouped together and simply labeled  \\n offshore IT operations.  \\n If there are differences between how the interactions occur,  \\n these differences will come to light  \\n when you drill down into the next level,  \\n when you create your functional flow diagram  \\n for each entity's interactions.  \\n Context diagrams do have their limitations and weaknesses,  \\n as they do not  \\n indicate the internal functionality of the organization,  \\n indicate timing or system interaction  \\n with its external entities,  \\n and do not capture all the modes  \\n that relationships are undertaken.  \\n It is possible to create many different models  \\n of any one system.  \\n This may well be necessary at some point,  \\n but when initiating a modeling exercise,  \\n it is a best practice to start with the operational view  \\n and the way the system has been designed and installed  \\n to deliver on the day to day operations.  \\n Constructing a context diagram might also require several  \\n build review iterations.  \\n It is unlikely that a fully populated context diagram  \\n can be drawn first up.  \\n Be careful and be sure  \\n to always validate your information as you go.  \\n Even if the context diagram you're analyzing  \\n is not going to be socialized,  \\n you need to ensure that your foundation  \\n is accurate as possible  \\n before you delve into the next level of detail.  \\n By keeping the diagram simple,  \\n your stakeholders can be easily walked through  \\n each of the relationships  \\n without being distracted or losing focus.  \\n Once you've worked through a few context diagrams,  \\n you'll be thankful that you've always had  \\n the big picture reference to refer back to  \\n when you start drilling down  \\n into the other business process modeling.  \\n Hopefully you will then end up in an enviable place

Elegance can be defined as the beauty  \\n that shows unusual effectiveness and simplicity.  \\n Functional flow diagrams can also be defined the same way,  \\n they can stand alone and at the same time  \\n can retain their elegance  \\n surrounded by other functional flow diagrams,  \\n and their interrelationships.  \\n Functional flow diagrams contribute many benefits  \\n when performing analysis.  \\n Firstly, these diagrams are a great way  \\n to provide others a quick overview of a scenario.  \\n They are useful in training of new staff  \\n or indeed, during audits or visits by customers.  \\n By having this overview,  \\n you are more likely to get consensus in teams  \\n and each will have the common understanding  \\n of what is being spoken about.  \\n By using the functional flow diagram,  \\n you're increasing your chances  \\n of finding opportunities to improve  \\n and it's a quick and easy method to learn  \\n and one that will bring a lot to the job you want to do.  \\n The functional flow diagram  \\n always starts with a stakeholder,  \\n usually the customer or another entity  \\n that is external to your organization,  \\n initiating the interaction.  \\n Customer is a commonly used description  \\n that starts or triggers the activity with an organization.  \\n This could be an online purchase,  \\n a call into a support area, a front customer service query.  \\n Governments around the world offer services,  \\n companies sell and deliver products,  \\n and charities deliver support,  \\n and all of this is based on the need  \\n and wants of the customer.  \\n When a customer initiates a transaction request,  \\n this creates a trigger internally to your organization.  \\n The recipient of that trigger  \\n will be the next functional area in your diagram.  \\n They will in turn, perform a function  \\n that when completed will create another trigger  \\n with another functional area,  \\n and so on until the final interaction with the customer  \\n and the required outcome is reached.  \\n All stakeholders or functional areas,  \\n whether they are internal or external,  \\n are captured in ovals.  \\n Like the context diagram,  \\n the functional flow diagram uses flows  \\n to indicate the relationship between the stakeholder groups.  \\n The flow in a functional flow diagram, however,  \\n must only have one label indicating the information,  \\n data, or activity flowing between each function.  \\n As with every action, there is a reaction.  \\n The flow of functions will usually start and end  \\n with its initiator.  \\n As the functions will tend to loop back to their initiator,  \\n you'll find that your functional flow diagram  \\n will also be arranged as such.  \\n Analysts and organizations alike  \\n leverage functional flow diagrams  \\n to provide the best experience to their customers  \\n by visualizing the flow of information  \\n and data found in the relationships  \\n between the two functional areas.  \\n These diagrams logically map the sequence  \\n and interdepartmental communications  \\n and interactions that reflect the current  \\n or different new way of achieving the expected outcome.  \\n As with the context diagram,  \\n the functional flow diagram should be kept uncluttered.  \\n Even the most complicated processes  \\n when documented at this level, will appear simple  \\n and should be easily interpreted by all audiences.  \\n Capturing functional flow diagrams are simple  \\n and at the same time effective  \\n in creating the scenarios, where they start,  \\n and how to achieve the expected goal of the activities.  \\n Their effectiveness and simplicity  \\n get my vote for the most elegant of the modeling tools.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2333039\",\"duration\":204,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"How to create a functional flow diagram\",\"fileName\":\"490754_02_03_MM30_create_2020Q2\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, review examples of functional flow diagrams and learn a step-by-step process to create the diagram.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":6963381,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

Swimmers, take your mark, get set, go!  \\n Cross-functional flow diagrams  \\n are recognized by their distinctive swim lane appearance.  \\n In fact, they're often referred to as swim lane diagrams.  \\n The swim lane will encompass all activities  \\n that fall to the responsibility  \\n of a particular functional area,  \\n just like a swimming race.  \\n You need to stay in your lane.  \\n All cross-functional flow diagrams are clearly named  \\n at the top of the diagram.  \\n Each actor is assigned their own swim lane  \\n and only those actors that have a part to play  \\n in the process need to be involved  \\n and assigned a swim lane.  \\n You will see in the example, the customer,  \\n merchant and credit card company  \\n are the three actors that will be participating  \\n in this cross-functional flow process.  \\n The great thing about these diagrams  \\n is that at a glance, you can see who is involved  \\n in the end-to-end process.  \\n There are many templates out there  \\n that can be used to create cross-functional flow diagrams  \\n and you'll find that their shapes can vary slightly.  \\n However, the general appearance of the shape  \\n will be the same.  \\n Each shape means something specific,  \\n so it's important that you understand  \\n that each is used for and what they represent.  \\n These shapes are called flow chart symbols.  \\n There are many different flow chart symbols  \\n and each have a specific purpose.  \\n To get started through,  \\n let's take a look at the six most common shapes.  \\n Firstly, there is the circle,  \\n which is the symbol used as the start  \\n and endpoints, also known as a terminator.  \\n The terminator represents  \\n where the process starts and terminates.  \\n Some templates use circles  \\n as connectors or links to other process maps  \\n and add the trigger on top of the circle.  \\n You can use circles or rounded rectangles like this one  \\n on your start or end point  \\n where the trigger is inside the rounded rectangle.  \\n Just make sure you're consistent  \\n so as not to confuse the reader.  \\n The next shape, and the one that's most commonly used  \\n is the rectangle or process box.  \\n I like to use the 90-degree angle boxes,  \\n though you may also encounter round edges.  \\n They both mean the same thing.  \\n The process box is used  \\n to capture each action needed to be performed  \\n and it is mapped out  \\n in the swim lane of the actor responsible  \\n for that activity.  \\n Here the merchant will submit purchase amount.  \\n The credit card company will authorize purchase  \\n and the merchant will complete sale  \\n and so the process goes on.  \\n Where the activities are more detailed,  \\n a separate process workflow or flow chart  \\n may be required.  \\n They can be represented in cross-functional flow diagrams  \\n as a pre-defined process or sub processes.  \\n Type boxes with the distinctive parallel lines.  \\n Some templates with have a small plus symbol as well  \\n and that will indicate they can be expanded on  \\n for more detail.  \\n This is a great feature  \\n as you're able to concentrate  \\n on communicating thoroughly  \\n how actions flow from functional area to functional area  \\n without clouding the document  \\n with lengthy, detailed workflows.  \\n Next up, we have the diamond shape or decision symbol.  \\n This symbol is used to indicate a step  \\n in the process where a decision has to be made.  \\n The outcome of that decision will split the flow  \\n of events into different exit paths from the diamond.  \\n Finally, all of the components are linked together  \\n with arrows or connectors,  \\n indicating the direction and order  \\n that the activities take place.  \\n They essentially connect all of the elements together  \\n and direct the reader through the process.  \\n In cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n the sequencing of steps will flow from the left  \\n to the right, moving up and down  \\n as the activity passes onto the next functional area  \\n so that they can perform their task.  \\n Arrows or connectors are not just used  \\n to show the direction of flow  \\n but can also be used to provide additional key information.  \\n Take the decision process symbol, for instance.  \\n You can see here  \\n that the diamond symbol contains a question.  \\n The direction of flow will be determined  \\n by the answer to that question.  \\n Annotating the connector with a yes  \\n or no allows the flow to respond accordingly  \\n and an alternative path is created.  \\n Now that you know how to create end-to-end processes  \\n using cross-functional flow diagrams,  \\n you'll be well on your way  \\n to winning that next swimming gold medal in no time.

Just like a jigsaw puzzle,  \\n you need all the pieces in a project  \\n to fit together to create the whole picture.  \\n Creating a cross-functional flow diagram  \\n is best achieved after you have validated the pieces  \\n of your functional flow diagram.  \\n We now take the functional flow diagram  \\n and drill down into the next level of detail.  \\n Each functional area and all the entities captured  \\n in your functional flow  \\n will essentially become a swim lane  \\n in your new diagram.  \\n Actors are allocated to each of the lanes down  \\n the left-hand side.  \\n Now you're ready to plot the sequence  \\n of activities across the swim lanes.  \\n In a way, what you are doing  \\n is unraveling the functional flow of diagrams  \\n in a linear process  \\n with a distinct start and end point.  \\n You will tell the story from where it initiates  \\n and then illustrate the flow of events,  \\n in particular how they cross over  \\n between each functional area.  \\n When documenting a business flow,  \\n I like to make the diagram horizontal with the actors  \\n on the left-hand side.  \\n A vertical format is more commonly used  \\n when mapping out technical  \\n or system cross-functional flow diagrams.  \\n However, the principles remain the same.  \\n Each cross-functional flow diagram needs  \\n to start with the process with the trigger event.  \\n A trigger is an event  \\n that has activated the process  \\n to begin on this template,  \\n it's represented by a solid terminated dot.  \\n You can also use circle shapes or rounded rectangles  \\n at the start and end of your diagram.  \\n From the trigger,  \\n we begin mapping out each activity using process box symbols  \\n and then connecting the two activities together  \\n using connecting arrows in the direction  \\n that the workflow needs to take.  \\n When creating a cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n ask yourself: in a perfect world  \\n what functions need to occur  \\n from start to finish to achieve the fastest way  \\n of completing the transaction?  \\n This is referred to as the happy path or main path.  \\n As you work through each step,  \\n clearly label each activity.  \\n As a general rule, each activity should be labeled  \\n with a verb-noun combination,  \\n such as authorize payment.  \\n There shouldn't be more than a few words in each box.  \\n If you find you need a really big box  \\n to explain everything that needs to happen  \\n at this point in the process,  \\n then you may need to consider breaking it  \\n into smaller several steps.  \\n As you map out each activity,  \\n there'll be situations where a decision is required,  \\n altering the flow of the events.  \\n This is where you need to use your decision diamond.  \\n The question is found inside the diamond  \\n and the yes, no path is added showing the flow  \\n with the outcome of the question.  \\n Within every organization,  \\n there's always challenges and unforeseen problems  \\n which occur and prevent a function  \\n from being completed.  \\n These are called alternate flows and exception flows.  \\n An example of an alternate flow  \\n is where a transaction continues  \\n via an alternate path, rejoining the original path  \\n to complete the transaction  \\n after the alternate process is complete.  \\n Exception flows are when a process comes  \\n to a complete stop.  \\n A completely different process or trigger  \\n is required to complete the activity.  \\n This is when you would create another swim lane diagram  \\n to capture the handling of this exception.  \\n Once you have completed your cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n you should have it validated by the actors.  \\n The best way is to organize a series  \\n of walk-throughs with the impacted areas  \\n of the business.  \\n During these sessions, ensure that you have representation  \\n from each area and have them validate  \\n what has been mapped in fact is what they do.  \\n When you are satisfied  \\n that you have conducted thorough validation walk-throughs  \\n and made all necessary changes,  \\n you are ready to expand all of your high-level process steps  \\n into what we call flow charts or process maps.  \\n These are the detailed steps  \\n that each individual actor needs  \\n to know how to complete their part in the process puzzle.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2327053\",\"duration\":294,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Pitfalls of cross-functional

you're going to do it right,  \\n do it right the first time.  \\n No truer statement has been made  \\n as you start delving into the lower-level details  \\n of the way an organization  \\n undertakes their daily activities.  \\n Modeling these activities and collecting them together  \\n create a valuable reference library,  \\n though the library may be of no use  \\n if you stock the shelves  \\n with languages that you can't read and understand.  \\n Cross-functional flow diagrams  \\n are most commonly used to capture the flow of activities  \\n throughout the end-to-end business process cycle.  \\n This is because they provide a great overview  \\n of how work flows between functional areas  \\n and usually have enough detail to be useful  \\n in analyzing gaps, inefficiencies, and complexities.  \\n Because of this,  \\n there is a tendency for business analysts to start here  \\n without truly understanding the full context  \\n of the functions that they're trying to document.  \\n This is an easy trap to fall into.  \\n If you don't do your homework,  \\n you will find yourself chasing your tail,  \\n validating and cross-checking  \\n and, in some cases, having to untangle  \\n and redo hours of work.  \\n Make sure that you always start with a context flow diagram,  \\n even if you think that you know your organization well.  \\n This could save you time and your reputation.  \\n Cross-functional flow diagrams  \\n are also often the main deliverables requested  \\n from key stakeholders and project managers  \\n and who may not necessarily understand the background work  \\n involved in producing an accurate version.  \\n A good business analyst will educate  \\n and involve those stakeholders early on in the process.  \\n This is incredibly useful  \\n when needing to sell ideas or options down the track.  \\n Another question I'm commonly asked  \\n by analysts from all over the world is,  \\n what level of detail do I need to include  \\n in my swim lanes?  \\n This one is a little tricky to answer without context.  \\n However, a general rule of thumb  \\n is to create a subprocess or process flowchart  \\n if you think that a series of steps can be grouped  \\n into a single action.  \\n The last thing you want to do is clutter the diagram.  \\n It's also important not to over-clutter  \\n or confuse your diagram with unnecessary detail.  \\n Your diagram will remain clear and concise  \\n if you simply include a subprocess  \\n rather than providing all the detail at this level.  \\n There's a rule of thumb  \\n that you should not exceed 16 activity boxes  \\n on any one sheet.  \\n White real estate around the shapes in the models  \\n also enables great readability and understanding.  \\n This all comes back  \\n to educating your project team and stakeholders.  \\n If you've been tasked with providing process maps,  \\n ensure that you are all on the same page  \\n and that expectations are aligned.  \\n Take a moment  \\n to walk through the types of business process models  \\n from the context, functional flow,  \\n cross-functional, and detailed flowchart diagrams.  \\n Understand what your end deliverables need to be  \\n and the process to get you there.  \\n This way, you'll have the support  \\n of your project team and stakeholders,  \\n and the process will be more streamlined.  \\n Of course, most importantly, whatever you decide,  \\n the key is be consistent  \\n across all of your cross-functional flow diagrams.  \\n With modern modeling software,  \\n there's an avalanche of available symbols,  \\n graphics, and shapes to select from.  \\n My advice is to limit the options  \\n in what shapes you will use  \\n as the last thing you want to create  \\n in any misinterpretation of what you are trying to share.  \\n As you finalize your cross-functional flow diagrams,  \\n begin socializing them with your stakeholders.  \\n When doing this, there are a few really important things  \\n that you should be aware of.  \\n Firstly, plan for interactions, reworks,  \\n and additional discussions.  \\n Don't expect that you'll have it documented right first off.  \\n A common problem is not allowing enough time  \\n for adequate walkthroughs.  \\n Secondly, understand timings of reviews.  \\n The walkthrough process always takes longer than you expect,  \\n especially if you have a number of stakeholders.  \\n Sending documents out prior to the walkthrough session  \\n and requesting attendees come prepared with questions  \\n can speed this process up.  \\n Next, maintain good version control.  \\n Ensure the models are the most current  \\n as you make any changes  \\n so as to ensure everyone is working off the correct version.  \\n And finally, authority to validate and provide sign off.  \\n It's important that stakeholders  \\n who attend verification meetings have the authority  \\n to validate and provide sign off if necessary.  \\n By following these guidelines  \\n and creating consistency in your modeling practice,  \\n you'll have a library that is valuable for years to come.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

Have you ever bought modular furniture?  \\n You know, the sort that requires you to self-assemble it?  \\n Getting hold of the instructions is essential.  \\n They give you the steps that need to be done  \\n and knowing in which sequence they need to happen.  \\n I've tried to do it on my own a number of times  \\n only to find that I have screws and bits left over.  \\n If I'd used the assembly instructions  \\n and followed the pictures, arrows and sequence,  \\n I'm sure it would have taken less time  \\n and achieved the result that looks  \\n just like the one on the front of the box.  \\n Flowchart diagrams are often referred to  \\n as simply process maps.  \\n Process maps document the flow of activities  \\n performed by a single actor at the lowest level of detail.  \\n Like the cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n these can be documented as existing,  \\n also referred to as current-state or as-is,  \\n or future-state, to-be process maps.  \\n A current-state flowchart process map is extremely useful  \\n in identifying and breaking down  \\n complex business processes.  \\n It also helps you analyze  \\n and identify process inefficiencies.  \\n The KRAC Model is a great tool to use for this process.  \\n When analyzing the current-state processes,  \\n you can look at what steps you need to keep,  \\n remove, maybe add or change to improve  \\n the end-to-end process.  \\n As inefficiencies are found,  \\n it is these changes that will form the beginning  \\n of your proposed new-and-improved, future-state processes.  \\n When you overlay both the current  \\n and future-state process maps together,  \\n the difference that you can find  \\n becomes a set of requirements.  \\n It is these requirements that the business needs  \\n in order to get to their desired future-state.  \\n By identifying what has changed,  \\n you can begin to analyze the impacts  \\n to the existing functional areas.  \\n This is called an impact assessment  \\n and it's extremely useful to help you understand  \\n the transition from the way things are done now  \\n to the way it needs to be.  \\n This old and the new way of doing things  \\n allows you to analyze organizational improvements  \\n and changes, but most importantly,  \\n to manage change across all levels of your organization.  \\n One of the greatest benefits in documenting  \\n flowchart process maps at this level  \\n is that they become the single source of truth  \\n and what needs to be done and in what sequence  \\n an actor needs to perform them.  \\n Process maps support the creation of test scripts  \\n and ensure the process delivers a consistent outcome.  \\n As testing is performed,  \\n errors and updates may impact on your processes.  \\n This feedback loop is vital for ongoing,  \\n continuous improvement activities.  \\n When used in conjunction  \\n with cross-functional flow diagrams,  \\n the flowchart process maps can be used  \\n to create instructional guides and other training materials  \\n like online knowledge center content,  \\n quick reference guides and training manuals.  \\n The analysis that goes into flowcharts  \\n can also help identify the amount of training required  \\n and the number of resources needed for tasks  \\n in the existing or new environment.  \\n The beauty of the detail in your flowchart process map  \\n is that a single activity performed by an individual  \\n or system can be captured in its entirety  \\n from start to end.  \\n A further benefit is its ability to isolate each activity.  \\n An activity can be assessed, refined,  \\n quality controlled, automated and updated  \\n without having to update the cross-functional flow diagram.  \\n Remember the process map is documented  \\n at the lowest level of detail,  \\n which means each step-by-step process will, in turn,  \\n become a step-by-step instruction for the end user  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2330911\",\"duration\":187,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Flowchart diagram features\",\"fileName\":\"490754_04_02_MM30_options_2020Q2\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, explore the features of the flowchart diagram including common symbols and formatting options and the instances where you would apply each of them.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2857480,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

I've referred to the flowchart diagrams,  \\n or process maps, as stepping stones.  \\n To get across a river without getting wet  \\n it's always a good idea to step on the stones  \\n closest to bank and then navigate your way step by step.  \\n So too with the steps to creating a flowchart diagram.  \\n Let's go through the best order  \\n to help you create an accurate and effective diagram.  \\n Before you put pen to paper or the whiteboard,  \\n it's important that you understand  \\n that flowchart process maps should always trace back  \\n to their parent cross-functional flow diagram.  \\n Keeping this connection in mind will help you think about  \\n what you should and shouldn't include  \\n on your flowchart diagram.  \\n Remembering back to our lessons  \\n on cross-functional flow diagrams,  \\n there are times where it's not practical  \\n to include lengthy step-by-step workflow details,  \\n and the number of steps begin to overwhelm the diagram.  \\n I recommend you group these workflows together  \\n in what we call predefined or subprocesses.  \\n It is these subprocesses that are expanded further  \\n and detailed now in your flowchart diagram.  \\n To guide you through the steps,  \\n let's use raise purchase order as an example  \\n of a subprocess that is being mapped  \\n in a cross-functional flow diagram using a subprocess box,  \\n so from this to this.  \\n Firstly, you need to use the round-cornered rectangle  \\n as the symbol used as the start and end points,  \\n also known as a terminator.  \\n In other templates covered in this course,  \\n we've also used circles.  \\n Either is fine as long as you're consistent in your diagrams  \\n and your stakeholders understand  \\n what you mean by your symbols.  \\n Refer back to your cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n which will show you the step just before  \\n the raise purchase order subprocesses was mapped.  \\n This will be the step that triggers this activity.  \\n Let's say that the last step was done by procurement,  \\n and it was for them to send approval.  \\n This means that your trigger to start your flowchart diagram  \\n will be receive approval from procurement.  \\n Second step, which is the actual multiple steps in one,  \\n is to map out each part of the process.  \\n To do this, you use the process box symbol  \\n until the activities workflow is complete.  \\n The trick is never having more than one step in each box.  \\n This is your chance to breakdown the process  \\n into the finest detail.  \\n Another trick to remember is that your flowchart diagram  \\n or process map doesn't need to flow from left to right.  \\n It can flow in a switchback formation  \\n or up and down the page as long as it is logical  \\n and the reader can interpret the flow of the events.  \\n Third step as you map out each activity  \\n is to note where a decision is required.  \\n This will alter the flow of events,  \\n and it is where you need to use your decision diamond.  \\n The diamond symbolizes that the pathways are not broken,  \\n and the normal flow of work can continue.  \\n In the same way the decision diamond is used  \\n in the cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n you need to choose the best way to annotate your response.  \\n Remember to try and be consistent  \\n wherever possible across all your maps.  \\n The fourth and final step is to never assume anything.  \\n Always run workshops.  \\n Talk to the people who are responsible  \\n for the work that you are trying to capture.  \\n Keep your sessions on track  \\n focusing on the normal process first  \\n and then considering the alternate flows.  \\n This will save you a lot of time and effort.  \\n I would also encourage you to ask one of your stakeholders  \\n to step you through the process  \\n and follow it on your flowchart  \\n if they deviate from the sequence you have captured.  \\n This will give you a greater insight  \\n into how different people interpret executing the process  \\n and keeping you all from falling into the murky waters  \\n of inaccurate process and flowchart mapping.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2331554\",\"duration\":203,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Pitfalls of flowchart diagrams\",\"fileName\":\"490754_04_04_MM30_mistakes_2020Q2\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about some of the issues that can surface when creating the flowchart diagram, common mistakes that can be made when developing the diagram, and how you can avoid them.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3090592,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - I like to relate work to life.  \\n It really helps get things sorted in my head.  \\n So when I think of flow chart diagrams  \\n and cross functional flow diagrams,  \\n I think of the challenges that come  \\n with raising my 12 year old twins.  \\n They are a boy and a girl, so they're not identical.  \\n They have similarities that are easy to spot,  \\n but they're also very different.  \\n And they want to be treated differently.  \\n So to with your diagrams.  \\n Drawing the line between cross functional flow diagrams  \\n and process maps, is the first problem I find.  \\n They may seem a little odd  \\n considering that the differences appear pretty clear.  \\n One has multiple actors, and the other a sole actor.  \\n However, you'd be surprised how often analysts  \\n will try to create a hybrid version,  \\n that attempts to encompass multiple players,  \\n in a single flow chart process map.  \\n Another challenge occurs when there hasn't been enough  \\n groundwork done before the flow chart is drawn up.  \\n I have seen occasions where the analyst  \\n jumps straight in trying to map out a flow chart process map  \\n without understanding the context  \\n in which the activity sits.  \\n It's a bit like starting a new job  \\n without knowing where your desk is, the floor you are on,  \\n or even the name of the company you work for.  \\n Without understanding the context  \\n behind the work flow that you want to map,  \\n you will struggle.  \\n This all comes back  \\n to educating your project team and stakeholders  \\n on the standards, guidelines, and principles  \\n to ensure discipline consistency.  \\n If you've been tasked with providing process maps,  \\n ensure that you are all on the same page.  \\n And that expectations are aligned.  \\n I like to include a legend of the symbols used  \\n at the bottom of each model, so there is no confusion.  \\n Take a moment to walk through  \\n the types of business process models,  \\n from the context, functional flow, cross functional flow,  \\n and detailed flow chart process maps.  \\n Understand what your end deliverable needs to be  \\n and the process you need to follow,  \\n in order to get you there.  \\n This way you'll have the support  \\n of your project team and stakeholders,  \\n and you will achieve what you set out to achieve,  \\n at the start of the project.  \\n Assumptions.  \\n Things that we believe to be true,  \\n but are not facts, can get you into a whole world of pain.  \\n The rule I follow is, don't assume anything.  \\n The next challenge is to engage your stakeholders  \\n every step of the way.  \\n Taking them on the journey with you  \\n will help you manage their expectations and create buying.  \\n Giving stakeholders their own sense  \\n of ownership of the processes you are mapping,  \\n will encourage them  \\n because they want to see the results.  \\n Don't be lazy.  \\n Validate your flow charts  \\n by circling back with the stakeholders  \\n and ensure that you have captured your information correctly  \\n and involve the necessary stakeholders.  \\n Remember all flow chart diagrams or process maps,  \\n must trace back to a cross functional flow diagram.  \\n They need to have context.  \\n If they don't belong to a cross functional flow,  \\n then they just simply float, and don't belong anywhere,  \\n and will be impossible to manage.  \\n Just like kids in a family really,  \\n as the parent analyst, all you have to do is make sure  \\n you're consistent, guide them in the same way,  \\n and respect their differences  \\n so that they achieve the outcomes that each is capable of.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"4.

maps.  \\n First up, we explored how your organization fits  \\n in the big picture and relates with the outside world.  \\n This is called the context diagram.  \\n Context diagram captures the relationships,  \\n input, and outputs that help your organization  \\n understand what is needed  \\n by these external entity relationships  \\n to deliver products and services to customers.  \\n These diagrams assist in understanding  \\n who and what you do to comply or influence  \\n in achieving the outcomes you're expecting.  \\n Your functional flow diagram  \\n shows a number of functional areas  \\n internal to your organization,  \\n and how they interact with the customer,  \\n being an external entity and each other.  \\n You have far greater influence and possible control  \\n over how your organization performs the required activities.  \\n The cross-functional flow diagram is exactly that,  \\n focusing on how the flow of work  \\n moves across the functional areas of your organization.  \\n This diagram should contain the complete end-to-end process  \\n of a single transaction or interaction  \\n from the initial customer trigger  \\n through to the delivery of a service or product.  \\n These diagrams are immensely valuable  \\n when it comes to seeking how you can sequence  \\n or change the activities  \\n to ensure greater efficacy or required compliance.  \\n You then have the ability  \\n to perform time and motion analysis  \\n to inform better ways of delivering the required outcome.  \\n Though placing too much information  \\n into these diagrams will dilute their value,  \\n imagine how many detailed processes  \\n would need to be captured.  \\n There would be potentially thousands of steps  \\n that need to be completed to cover the end-to-end process.  \\n This is where subprocesses come in.  \\n Through the creation of this diagram,  \\n you'll have identified many subprocesses.  \\n Finally, we take all of the subprocesses  \\n that are in our cross-functional flow diagram  \\n and expand them into the finest level of detail  \\n in what you now know as flowchart process maps.  \\n The more sub processes that you identified  \\n in your cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n the more flowcharts you will need to map.  \\n This is a beautiful way of visualizing  \\n how fundamentally your cross-functional flow diagram  \\n provides the context for every flow chart process map  \\n that belongs within  \\n That's why, when used in conjunction,  \\n both are used to create instructional guides  \\n and other training materials  \\n like online knowledge center content,  \\n quick reference guides, and training manuals.  \\n Business process modeling enables greater clarity  \\n when we decompose activities  \\n across the processing modeling hierarchy.  \\n This enables you to analyze  \\n the different areas of change management  \\n to identify the amount of training required,  \\n and the number of resources required to perform the tasks  \\n in the existing or new environment.  \\n So the next time you're wanting to know where to start,  \\n sing along with me,  \\n \u266a

now that we know what the four different models are  \\n and how they interrelate,  \\n let's discuss how we put our modeling practice into action  \\n with your stakeholders.  \\n The key to understanding which model you need  \\n to focus on  \\n is in understanding your objective.  \\n Depending on your objectives,  \\n the emphasis or focus on each model will be different.  \\n Essentially, you'll need to use them in some degree  \\n to ensure you have adequate coverage  \\n and don't miss anything.  \\n Ask yourself, what is the area of focus?  \\n What already exists?  \\n Who is the end user?  \\n And how will the information I am capturing be used?  \\n Answering all of these questions  \\n will greatly assist in ensuring that you have  \\n the right stakeholders at the right workshops,  \\n and that you are delivering  \\n the best quality business processes fit for purpose.  \\n Throughout the course  \\n I will have mentioned the use of workshops and walk-throughs  \\n with key stakeholders and subject matter experts.  \\n Let's talk a little about  \\n engaging these subject matter experts  \\n in process elicitation workshops.  \\n Firstly, target your SME audience to meet your needs.  \\n Collaboration with key stakeholders  \\n and subject matter experts is exceptionally important,  \\n ensuring that you set up a workshop environment  \\n that has a clear objective,  \\n and that the right people are present and participating.  \\n The last thing we want to do  \\n is make false assumptions during our modeling.  \\n Let's make use of the whiteboard.  \\n Whiteboards are great  \\n because you can freely outline the context,  \\n and go back and update or build upon them at any point.  \\n In my experience,  \\n I've found making use of colored markers  \\n for distinction between actors  \\n or a change in process flow to be a great help.  \\n The best thing about using a whiteboard  \\n is that at the end of the session  \\n you can take a photo of the information you have captured,  \\n and go back and document it at your leisure.  \\n Another great method is simply using sticky notes.  \\n These sticky notes are particularly good if you're mapping  \\n cross-functional flow or flowchart process maps.  \\n During a workshop situation  \\n you can have your stakeholders participate,  \\n and together map out a process  \\n on a whiteboard, wall, or even a table.  \\n The sticky notes can be easily added, removed,  \\n or moved about as the process is discussed and agreed upon.  \\n The beauty of using sticky notes  \\n is everyone can see, comment,  \\n and get involved in the mapping process.  \\n Again, don't forget to take a photo  \\n so you can document the processes later.  \\n Next, once you have completed your diagram  \\n you are ready to have it validated.  \\n A stakeholder walk-through session is ideal.  \\n In my experience the best way to do this  \\n is to project your models up on a screen  \\n and walk through each step of the process  \\n to ensure that your audience is happy.  \\n And finally, to achieve sign off or approval,  \\n ensure that you have the key stakeholders  \\n who are responsible for sign off  \\n present at your walk-through sessions.  \\n I'd also recommend that you include representation  \\n from the ones who will be using your maps  \\n whether that is for training purposes  \\n or organizational change management needs.  \\n Modeling is an awesome way to leverage the use of visuals.  \\n With these diagrams you can capture, analyze,  \\n and determine future ways  \\n that organizations perform the work required.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Put It All

outcomes and goals.\\nThis is where Business process modeling comes in.\\nIt's a fantastic visual way to represent how an organization\\ncomes together and performs the work and services needed.\\n\\nEffective process modeling allows us\\ncapturing various levels of detail\\nthrough the benefits of pictures and how the different parts\\nof the organization interact with one another.\\nBusiness process modeling is a technique\\nof capturing the series of processes\\nand how they relate to one another.\\nThe reasons we create process models is to provide\\na visual representation of who does what and in what order.\\nThese models provide us with a better awareness\\nof the end-to-end processes and identify the additional\\ninformation and detail needed to

interaction that enables outcomes to be achieved.\\nIn modeling terminology, the stakeholders\\nare referred to as actors.\\n\\nAn actor can be a person, department, system,\\nor an external entity to the organization.\\nThe effectiveness of Business process modeling\\nis to firstly help clarify the steps needed\\nin a particular process.\\nWe then need to add our understanding how\\nthe people, processes, and technologies\\nwithin an organization interact\\nto create the overall system and outcomes.\\nBusiness process modeling is used in understanding\\nthe business operation and,

planned\\nas the expected future state.\\nProcess modeling captures the interrelationships\\nbetween the people, processes, activities, and systems\\nin delivering the expected outcome.\\n\\nI want to share with you the four most commonly used\\nbusiness modeling tools at a high-level overview.\\nThe first tool is referred to as the context diagram.\\nThe context diagram provides the high-level framework\\nand interaction of an organization.\\nThe context diagram depicts the organization\\nthat is being analyzed as shown as a circle,\\nthe external entities that connect to the area\\nor system being analyzed represented by boxes,\\nand lastly the relationship of interactions\\nbetween the organization and the external entities.\\n\\nThese are shown as the arrows.\\nThe context diagram is commonly used\\nin understanding and documenting the interrelationship\\nbetween those outside of the organization,\\nnamely the external entities,\\nand the touchpoints into your organization.\\nAs can be seen by the diagram,\\nour focus here are the interrelationships and activities\\nthat are either initiated or needed by the organization.\\nWe now arrive at our next diagram,\\nthe functional flow diagram.\\nThe functional flow diagram is a simple model\\nshowing the functional areas or stakeholders\\ninternally to our organization\\nand how they interact in a logical overall flow of work.\\n\\nThe functional flow diagram always starts\\nwith a stakeholder, usually the customer\\nor another entity external to the organization,\\ninitiating a transaction.\\nStakeholders and internal functional areas\\nare captured in the ovals.\\nThen the appropriate relationships and workflows\\nare drawn between these stakeholder groups.\\nAs we continue our journey down\\ninto the next level of detail,\\nwe start creating cross-functional flow diagrams\\nas a way to capture and sequentially display\\nthe activities that are performed.\\n\\nThe stakeholders are also referred to\\nas actors in the process.\\nRemembering an actor can be a person, system,\\nor functional area.\\nCross-functional flow diagrams are also referred to\\nas activity diagrams and swim lane diagrams.\\nThese diagrams organize activity sequences\\nthat displays the process in the context\\nof the actors responsible for performing the work.\\nThis added structure makes it very easy to read\\nand quickly identifies the individual actor's work\\nas well as cross-functional interactions needed.\\n\\nThese diagrams are very effective in visually sharing\\na process is performed from start to finish\\nand what each and every stakeholder or actor\\nneeds to perform to enable completion of the activity.\\nFinally, we come to the fourth type of modeling\\nknown as process flowcharting.\\nThese traditional process flow models\\nshow the sequential flow of activities,\\ndecision points and other interactions.\\nProcess flow models are used as a way\\nto capture the step-by-step procedures\\nand activities performed by an individual actor.\\n\\nThese process describe who and what has to be involved\\nin fully responding to an event\\nor how people in the enterprise\\ncollaborate to achieve a goal.\\nThese process workflow models are the lower-level detail\\nnot represented in the cross-functional swim lane models.\\nBy visually starting with the big picture,\\nwe cascade into finer detail\\nand create the fourth business process modeling diagrams,\\nthe context diagram, the functional flow diagram,\\nthe cross-functional flow

complex.\\n\\nI want to share a few pitfalls that you can easily fall into\\nwhen creating context diagrams.\\nThe most common is getting too detailed.\\nRather than having a flow for each interaction,\\nyou can simplify your diagram by listing all types\\nof interactions on a single flow.\\nThese are called processes.\\nThese processes can each be analyzed separately\\nand drug down to a more detail when we create\\nthe next level of detail in the functional flow diagram.\\n\\nLet's take an example of an organization\\nthat has the bulk of its IT operations done overseas.\\nIf we were to mention every single overseas partner,\\nthe diagram would be difficult to read\\nand would not create an easy, at-a-glance view.\\nLet's take a closer look at this example.\\nHere, the organization has partnered\\nwith multiple external offshore businesses,\\nresponsible for all the IT operational support\\nfor the organization.\\nThey have partnerships in Manila, India, Philippines,\\njust to mention a few.\\n\\nAs the information that needs to flow\\nto the external provider,\\nthe delivered outcome from the external provider\\nis the same.\\nAll entities can be grouped together and simply labeled\\noffshore IT operations.\\nIf there are differences between how the interactions occur,\\nthese differences will come to light\\nwhen you're drug down into the next level\\nwhen you create your functional flow diagram\\nfor each entity's interactions.\\nContext diagrams do have their limitations\\nof weaknesses as they do not indicate\\nthe internal functionality of the organization,\\nindicate timing or system interaction\\nwith its external entities,\\nand do not capture all the modes\\nthat relationships are undertaken.\\n\\nIt is possible to correct many different models\\nof any one system.\\nThis may well be necessary at some point,\\nbut when initiating a modeling exercise,\\nit is a best practice to start with the operational view\\nin the way the system has be designed and installed\\nto deliver on the day-to-day operations.\\nConstructing a context diagram may also require\\nseveral build review iterations.\\nIt is unlikely that a fully populated context diagram\\ncan be drawn first up.\\nBe sure to understand the purpose of a context diagram.\\n\\nIf this is the case, be careful and be sure to always\\nvalidate your information as you go.\\nEven if the context diagram you are analyzing\\nis not going to be socialized,\\nyou need to ensure that your foundation is accurate\\nas possible before you dove into

Swimmers, take your mark, get set, go!\\nCross-functional flow diagrams are recognized\\nby their distinctive swim line appearance.\\nIn fact, they're often referred to as swim line diagrams.\\nThe swim line will encompass all activities\\nthat fall to the responsibility of a particular\\nfunctional area, just like a swimming race.\\nYou need to stay in your lane.\\nStakeholders are found at the start of each lane.\\nThey are referred to as actors.\\n\\nThis is because each actor is playing\\na role in the end to end story.\\nAll cross-functional flow diagrams are clearly\\nnamed at the top of the diagram.\\nEach actor is assigned their own swim lane,\\nand only those actors that have a part to play in the\\nprocess need to be involved, and assigned a swim lane.\\nYou're seeing the example, a customer, merchant,\\nand credit card company are the three actors\\nthat will be participating in this\\ncross-functional flow process.\\n\\nThe great thing about these diagrams, is that at a glance\\nyou can see who is involved in the end to end process.\\nThere are many templates out there that can be\\nused to create cross-functional flow diagrams.\\nYou will find that their shapes can vary slightly.\\nHowever, the general appearance of\\nthe shape will be the same.\\nEach shape means something specific,\\nso it's important that you understand that each is used for,\\nand what they represent.\\nThese shapes are called flow chart symbols.\\n\\nThere are many different flow chart symbols,\\nand each have a specific purpose.\\nTo get started through, let's take a look\\nat the six most common shapes.\\nFirstly, there is the circle, which is the symbol used\\nas the start and end points, also known as, a terminator.\\nThe terminator represents where the\\nprocess starts, and terminates.\\nSome templates use circles as connectors,\\nor links, to other process maps,\\nand add the trigger on top of the circle.\\n\\nYou can use circles, or rounded rectangles,\\nlike this one on your start or end point,\\nwhere the trigger is inside the rounded rectangle.\\nJust make sure you're consistent,\\nso as not to confuse the reader.\\nThe next shape, and the one that's most commonly used,\\nis the rectangle, or process box.\\nI like to use the 90 degree angle boxes.\\nThough, you may also encounter round edges.\\nThey both mean the same thing.\\nThe process boxes used to capture each action needed\\nto be performed, and it is mapped out in the swim lane\\nof the actor responsible for that activity.\\n\\nHere the merchant will submit purchase amount.\\nThe credit card company will authorize purchase.\\nThe merchant will complete sale.\\nSo the process goes on.\\nWhere the activities are more detailed,\\na separate process work flow,\\nor flow chart, may be required.\\nThat can be represented in cross-functional flow diagrams,\\nas a predefined process, or subprocesses\\ntype boxes with a distinctive parallel lines.\\n\\nSome templates will have a small plus symbol as well,\\nand that will indicate they can be\\nexpanded on for more detail.\\nThis is a great feature, as you're able to concentrate\\non communicating thoroughly how actions flow\\nfrom functional area to functional area,\\nwithout clouding the document with\\nlengthy detailed workflows.\\nNext up, we have the diamond shape, or decision symbol.\\nThis symbol is used to indicate a step in the process,\\nwhere a decision has to be made.\\n\\nThe outcome of that decision will split the flow of\\nevents into different exit paths from the diamond.\\nFinally, all of the components are\\nlinked together with arrows or connectors.\\nIndicating the direction, and order,\\nthat the activities take place.\\nThey essentially connect all of the elements together,\\nand direct the reader through the process.\\nIn cross-functional flow diagram,\\nthe sequencing of steps will flow\\nfrom the left to the right.\\nMoving up, and down, as the activity passes\\non to the next functional area,\\nso that they can perform their task.\\n\\nArrows, or connectors, are not just\\nused to show the direction of flow.\\nThey can also be used to provide\\nadditional key information.\\nTake the decision process symbol, for instance.\\nYou can see that the diamond symbol contains a question.\\nThe direction of flow will be determined\\nby the answer to that question.\\nAnnotating the connector with a yes, or no,\\nallows the flow to respond accordingly,\\nand an alternative path is created.\\nNow that you know how to create end to end processes\\nusing cross-functional flow diagrams,\\nyou'll be well on your way to winning\\nthat next swimming gold medal in no

functional flow will essentially become\\na swim line in your new diagram.\\nActors are the stakeholders who will need to perform\\nthe required activities.\\n\\nActors can be either a person, system, or functional area.\\nActors are allocated to each of the lanes\\ndown the left-hand side.\\nNow you're ready to plot the sequence of activities\\nacross the swim lanes.\\nIn a way, what you are doing is unraveling\\nthe functional flow of diagrams in a linear process\\nwith a distinct start and end point.\\nYou will tell the story from where it initiates,\\nand then illustrate the flow of events, in particular\\nhow they cross over, between each functional area.\\n\\nWhen documenting a business flow, I like to make the diagram\\nhorizontal with the actors on the left-hand side.\\nA vertical format is more commonly used when mapping out\\ntechnical, or a system cross-functional flow diagrams.\\nHowever, the principles remain the same.\\nEach cross-functional flow diagram needs to start\\nthe process with a trigger event.\\nA trigger is an event that has activated\\nthe process to begin.\\nOn this template, it's represented by\\na solid terminated dot.\\n\\nYou can also use circle shapes or rounded rectangles\\nat the start and end of your diagram.\\nFrom the trigger, we begin mapping out each activity using\\nprocess box symbols, and then connecting the two activities\\ntogether using connecting arrows in the direction\\nthat the work flow needs to take.\\nWhen creating a cross-functional flow diagram,\\nask yourself, in a perfect world, what functions\\nneed to occur from start to finish to achieve\\nthe fastest way of completing the transaction.\\n\\nThis is referred to as the happy path, or main path.\\nAs you work through each step, clearly label each activity.\\nAs a general rule, each activity should be labeled\\nwith a verb-noun combination such as authorize payment.\\nThere shouldn't be more than a few words in each box.\\nIf you find you need a really big box to explain everything\\nthat needs to happen at this point in the process,\\nthen you may need to consider breaking it\\ninto smaller, several steps.\\n\\nAs you map out each activity, there will be situations where\\na decision is required, altering the flow of the events.\\nThis is where you need to use your decision diamond.\\nThe question is found inside the diamond,\\nand the yes-no path is added showing the flow\\nwith the outcome of the question.\\nWithin every organization, there are always challenges\\nand unforeseen problems which occur and prevent\\na function from being completed.\\nThese are called alternate flows and exception flows.\\n\\nAn example of an alternate flow is where a transaction\\ncontinues by an alternate path, rejoining the\\noriginal path to complete the transaction\\nafter the alternate process is complete.\\nException flows are when a process comes to a complete stop.\\nA completely different process or trigger\\nis required to complete the activity.\\nThis is when you would create another swim lane diagram\\nto capture the handling of this exception.\\nOnce you have completed your cross-functional flow diagram,\\nyou should have it validated by the actors.\\n\\nThe best way is to organize a series of walkthroughs\\nwith the impacted areas of the business.\\nDuring these sessions, ensure that you have representation\\nfrom each area, and have them validate what has been mapped,\\nin fact, is what they do.\\nWhen you are satisfied that you have conducted\\nthorough validation walkthroughs

activities.\\nModeling these activities and collecting them together\\ncreate a valuable reference library.\\nThough the library may be of no use if you stock the shelves\\nwith languages that you can't read and understand.\\nCross-functional flow diagrams are most commonly used\\nto capture the flow of activities throughout\\nthe end-to-end business process cycle.\\n\\nThis is because they provide a great overview\\nof how work flows between functional areas,\\nand usually have enough detail to be useful\\nin analyzing gaps, inefficiencies, and complexities.\\nBecause of this, there is a tendency for business analysts\\nto start here without truly understanding the full context\\nof the functions that are trying to document.\\nThis is an easy trap to fall in to.\\nIf you don't do your homework, you will find yourself\\nchasing your tail, validating and cross-checking, and,\\nin some cases, having to untangle and redo hours of work.\\n\\nMake sure that you always start with a context-flow diagram,\\nEven if you think that you know your organization well.\\nThis could save you time and your reputation.\\nCross-functional flow diagrams are also often\\nthe main deliverables

and involve\\nthose stakeholders early on in the process.\\n\\nThis is incredibly useful when needing to sell ideas\\nor options down the track.\\nAnother question I'm commonly asked by analysts\\nfrom all over the world is what level of detail\\ndo I need to include in my swim lanes.\\nThis one is a little tricky to answer without context,\\nhowever, a general rule of thumb is to create\\na sub-process or process flow chart if you think\\nthat a series of steps can be grouped into a single action.\\nThe last thing you want to do is clutter the diagram.\\n\\nIt's also important not to over-clutter or confuse\\nyour diagram with unnecessary detail.\\nYour diagram will remain clear and concise\\nif you simply include a sub-process rather than providing\\nall the detail at this level.\\nThere's a rule of thumb that you should not exceed\\n16 activity boxes on any one sheet.\\nWhite real estate around the shapes in the models\\nalso enables great readability and understanding.\\nThis all comes back to educating your\\nproject team and stakeholders.\\n\\nIf you've been tasked with providing process maps,\\nensure that you are all on the same page,\\nand that expectations are aligned.\\nTake a moment to walk through the types of\\nbusiness process models from the context, functional flow,\\ncross-functional, and detailed flow chart diagrams.\\nUnderstand what your end deliverables need to be,\\nand the process to get you there.\\nThis way you'll have the support of your project team\\nand stakeholders, and the process will be more streamlined.\\n\\nOf course, most importantly, whatever you decide,\\nthe key is be consistent across all of your\\ncross-functional flow diagrams.\\nWith modern modeling software, there's an avalanche of\\navailable symbols, graphics, and shapes to select from.\\nMy advice is to limit the options in what shapes\\nyou will use, as the last thing you want to create\\nin any misinterpretation of what you are trying to share.\\nAs you finalize your cross-functional flow diagrams,\\nbegin socializing them with your stakeholders.\\n\\nWhen doing this there are a few really important things\\nthat you should be aware of.\\nFirstly, plan for iterations, re-works,\\nand additional discussions.\\nDon't expect that you'll have it documented right first off.\\nA common problem is not allowing enough time\\nfor adequate walkthroughs.\\nSecondly, understand timings of reviews.\\nThe walkthrough process always takes longer than you expect,\\nespecially if you have a number of stakeholders.\\nSending documents out prior to the walkthrough session,\\nand requesting attendees come prepared with questions\\ncan speed this process up.\\n\\nNext, maintain good version control.\\nEnsure the models are the most

diagram.\\nBefore you put pen to paper, or the whiteboard,\\nit's important that you understand\\nthat flowchart process maps should always trace back,\\nto their parent, cross-functional flow diagram.\\n\\nKeeping this connection in mind,\\nwill help you think about what you should,\\nand shouldn't include, on your flowchart diagram.\\nRemembering back to our lessons on cross-functional\\nflow diagrams, there are times where it's\\nnot practical to include lengthy, step by step\\nworkflow details, and the number of steps\\nbegin to overwhelm the diagram.\\nI recommend you group these workflows together,\\nin what we called pre-defined, or sub-processes.\\nIt is these sub-processes that are expanded further,\\nand detailed, now, in your flowchart diagram.\\n\\nTo guide you through the steps,\\nlet's use raise purchase order,\\nas an example of a sub-process,\\nthat is being mapped in a cross-functional\\nflow diagram, using a sub-process box.\\nSo, from this, to this.\\nFirstly, you need to use the round cornered rectangle\\nas the symbol used as the start, and end points,\\nalso known, as a terminator.\\nIn other templates covered, in this\\ncourse, we've also used circles.\\nEither is fine, as long as you're consistent,\\nin your diagrams, and, your stakeholders\\nunderstand what you mean, by your symbols.\\n\\nIn this box, you note the trigger for the process.\\nTo do this, ask yourself: how do they know\\nthat they have to raise a purchase order?\\nRefer back to your cross-functional flow diagram,\\nwhich will show you the step just before\\nthe raise purchase order sub-processes was mapped.\\nThis will be the step, that triggers this activity.\\nLet's say that the last step was done, by procurement,\\nand, it was for them to send approval.\\nThis means that your trigger, to start\\nyour flowchart diagram, will be\\nreceive approval, from procurement.\\n\\nSecond step, which is the actual, multiple steps,\\nin one, is to map out each part of the process.\\nTo do this, you use the process box symbol,\\nuntil the activities workflow is complete.\\nThe trick is never having more than one step, in each box.\\nThis is your chance, to break down\\nthe process, into the finest detail.\\nAnother trick to remember, is that\\nyour flowchart diagram, or process map,\\ndoesn't need to flow from left to right.\\nIt can flow in a switchback formation,\\nor, up and down the page, as long as it is logical,\\nand the reader can interpret the flow of the events.\\n\\nThird step, as you map out each activity,\\nis to note where a decision is required.\\nThis will alter the flow of events, and,\\nit is where you need to use your decision diamond.\\nThe diamond symbolizes that the pathways are not broken,\\nand the normal flow of work can continue.\\nIn the same way the decision diamond is used,\\nin the cross-functional flow diagram,\\nyou need to choose the best way, to annotate your response.\\nRemember to try and be consistent,\\nwherever possible, across all your maps.\\nThe fourth, and final step, is to never assume anything.\\n\\nAlways run workshops.

Have a central repository to store them.  \\n Once written down in detail to the same level,  \\n represent and agree those  \\n as per the requirements approval process.  \\n Irrespective of whether the requirement  \\n came from meeting minutes or from the top executive,  \\n it should all follow the same process.  \\n You could have all the tools, smart reports,  \\n and top support on the project,  \\n but it's the basic due diligence principle  \\n to document everything thoroughly and regularly.  \\n Number three. Replay requirements back to the requesters  \\n and other stakeholders.  \\n If it's agreed, it's in the can, right? Not always.  \\n Even though you may have received it, documented it,  \\n agreed it with the project team and the stakeholders,  \\n there's still a chance that it's not needed.  \\n Over time and with perspective,  \\n they may come to realize a requirement is not needed.  \\n Also, what I have learned  \\n is that the same business stakeholders and end users  \\n may see the same business need differently.  \\n Include regular review meetings,  \\n review and replay requirements all together  \\n and with the same group of requesters.  \\n Prioritize and reprioritize  \\n until you are certain your list is solid.  \\n Number four. Lock them down.  \\n What I mean by this is once you agree to the requirements,  \\n have a deadline for changes and additions.  \\n Once the deadline is passed, this is it.  \\n No more amendments or improvements or tweaks.  \\n This, of course, is in the purest world  \\n and the real project dynamics may differ.  \\n I get it.

Yes.  \\n The terms are sometimes used interchangeably,  \\n but that's wrong.  \\n They're actually very different,  \\n but they're also linked.  \\n Let me show you.  \\n Let's look at an example  \\n such as delivering any project successfully.  \\n So here are the five typical critical success factors:  \\n Clear project objective,  \\n executive support for the initiative,  \\n stakeholder involvement, project management expertise,  \\n and stakeholder buying.  \\n Once we have the critical success factors,  \\n you use them to define specific KPIs.  \\n These are data points that enable a project  \\n or an organization to decide whether CSFs have been met.  \\n For our project example, this will be things like  \\n the percentage of employees  \\n who clearly get the project objective,  \\n the number of executives supporting the transformation,  \\n the percentage of stakeholders dedicated  \\n to the project initiative,  \\n percentage of employees dedicated  \\n to their initiative with project management skills,  \\n the percentage of stakeholders  \\n who support the transformation.  \\n This type of work is normally driven  \\n by people like the project manager,  \\n senior project team members, and business stakeholders.  \\n But now you know the process and the steps involved,  \\n you can help develop  \\n your project's critical success factors and KPIs.  \\n And why are we doing any of this?  \\n To demonstrate clearly that the business transformation  \\n is delivering value.  \\n So define your CSFs.  \\n Use your KPIs.  \\n You measure that it's working.  \\n You measure that it's progressing.  \\n And you measure that the organization is truly transforming.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4361492\",\"duration\":263,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Balanced business scorecard for performance management\",\"fileName\":\"2453332_en_US_03_02_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about the framework used to craft a balanced business scorecard (BSC) to monitor performance.

When it comes to business transformation,  \\n there is one tool  \\n with unparalleled power,  \\n clearly showing the achievements  \\n as well as the pitfalls.  \\n The balance business scorecard is  \\n a set of performance targets.  \\n It covers four dimensions of performance,  \\n financial, operational,  \\n customer, and innovation.  \\n Now, the idea of the card is  \\n that we need to present measures  \\n to gauge how well we are tracking,  \\n but if we only focus on, let's say,  \\n the operational side,  \\n and we measure turnover,  \\n time, and defects,  \\n we may not understand  \\n the customer's needs and wants.  \\n Equally, if we're focused  \\n on customers only,  \\n the resulting measures may not give us  \\n much in terms of internal capability,  \\n learning and growth.  \\n So income, the balance business scorecard,  \\n you want to create a view  \\n with a balance presentation of financial,  \\n operational, customer,  \\n and innovation measures.  \\n The scorecard is presented  \\n in an easy to read dashboard format.  \\n It enables organizations  \\n to visually draw  \\n and consolidate information  \\n in a single view.  \\n Here I'll go through the basic building blocks  \\n of a balanced business scorecard.  \\n The original balance scorecard  \\n includes four perspectives,  \\n innovation, operational,  \\n customer, and financial.  \\n These can be flexed somewhat,  \\n and I have seen scorecards  \\n from other perspectives,  \\n including risk, for example.  \\n For our purposes,  \\n we'll stick with the original.  \\n Let zoom in on innovation perspective.  \\n You may also see this referenced  \\n as organizational capacity,  \\n also, the Babbel guide calls this  \\n learning and growth.  \\n I tend to gravitate first to this aspect,  \\n as it covers people,  \\n and indicates how good the organization is  \\n at innovation.  \\n It gives us a steer  \\n for the corporate culture,  \\n the employees openness,  \\n and ability to change,  \\n and scores the employees existing training  \\n and capability.  \\n Now, the outcomes of the metrics guide  \\n the organizational investment  \\n when it comes to knowledge up skill.  \\n It also casts a perspective  \\n on the organizational enablers,  \\n such as the infrastructure  \\n and the technology,  \\n with the idea for the employees  \\n to gain further capabilities  \\n and resources that convert their knowledge  \\n into a competitive advantage.  \\n Next area is the operational perspective.  \\n I've seen this referenced  \\n as business processes,  \\n as well as internal processes.  \\n This is where operations are tracked  \\n and analyzed to ensure  \\n the organizational promise  \\n to customers is fulfilled.  \\n These are the metrics  \\n that would also guide things such  \\n as cost saving initiatives.  \\n This is also the area  \\n where you can look at automation  \\n and innovation when it comes to internal processes.  \\n After that,  \\n we have the customer perspective.  \\n The area that speaks directly  \\n to how satisfied the customers are,  \\n with the product or service.  \\n Customer feedback is used  \\n to come up with the measures,  \\n things such as customer satisfaction,  \\n net promoter scores,  \\n customer retention,  \\n and acquisition.  \\n This is important,  \\n as it gives us a view from the outside,  \\n a biased perspective.  \\n And last but not least,  \\n is the financial leg.  \\n Yes, I've called them perspectives still now,  \\n but you can also see them as legs.  \\n Do what works for you.  \\n The financial metrics are  \\n the easiest to come up with,  \\n but be warned,  \\n the fact that you may strive  \\n for increased sales or lower expenses,  \\n does not provide a steer  \\n for how to actually achieve these.  \\n Only once you link the outcome  \\n from the four perspectives,  \\n a balanced picture will start to emerge.  \\n This is definitely an advanced tool  \\n in business analysis,  \\n but don't get overwhelmed,  \\n it's just another tool  \\n that you can master with practice.  \\n The best part is  \\n that the scorecard can be used  \\n to validate the CSFs  \\n and KPIs you developed earlier.  \\n They should all stem  \\n from the organizational mission, vision,  \\n and values for the project.  \\n In the next video,  \\n I'll go through a real life example  \\n and show you how to implement this  \\n on any project.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4361493\",\"duration\":259,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"How to apply a balanced business scorecard to your project\",\"fileName\":\"2453332_en_US_03_03_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to apply the BBS to a real-life scenario.

Next is customer.  \\n The main functions of a new HR tech  \\n are to meet customer needs more effectively  \\n and to increase customer satisfaction.  \\n For the example we're working on,  \\n our customers are our internal employees.  \\n So what should we measure?  \\n Well, it's things like internal employee satisfaction score,  \\n number of employee complaints for HR processes.  \\n At last, the area that I love talking about, innovation,  \\n or learning and growth, the employee's ability  \\n to scale up knowledge and skills.  \\n Part of the project is to teach employees  \\n how to use the new HR system.  \\n So we are measuring things such as  \\n number of Workday tickets logged  \\n and number of closed Workday tickets.  \\n And the good thing, or the tricky thing,  \\n depending on how you look at it,  \\n about HR Tech is that everyone  \\n within the organization is a customer,  \\n including the HR employees themselves, even your CEO.  \\n And you know the saying, the customer's always right.  \\n Well, during elicitation time,  \\n I'm sure all the customers will be  \\n coming up with new perspectives all the time,  \\n especially those vocal or high-level stakeholders.  \\n So while the voice of the customer is important,  \\n this scorecard will help us to view performance  \\n in several areas simultaneously.  \\n That's what makes it balanced, that's what makes it great  \\n and that's what makes it objective  \\n for you and for your stakeholders.  \\n You can use the card as a project initiative gauge,  \\n as a communication tool,  \\n as a performance improvement motivator.  \\n In fact, you can use it  \\n as an underlying conversation starter  \\n in most business contexts because of its wide grasp.  \\n If you're assigned to a business transformation initiative  \\n and there is no mention of this tool, then think again.  \\n Do one of your own.  \\n Show it to the team. Show them the benefits.  \\n Show them that the outcomes are directly correlated  \\n to the promise the business transformation will deliver.  \\n You will gain points not only with stakeholders  \\n but with your own product and delivery teams too,  \\n ensuring a balanced view,  \\n highlighting the most pressing challenges  \\n are front and center.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

increments\\nthat we can get feedback on and learn from.\\n\\nThe first step I've found to be really hard for many teams,\\nand it's something that the Agile BA\\nhas a huge influence on.\\nThis enables teams to get fast feedback\\nand this feedback helps them reduce risk\\nand know they are making real progress.\\nBeing able to identify, analyze, and define these increments\\nand then communicate these to the team and stakeholders\\nis where I see agile BAs shine.\\nThis course will be digging much more into the skills\\nin play to make this happen.\\n\\nAnd last, being an agile BA is about owning our role\\nand the skill gaps we fill on the team.\\nUnderstanding how analysis skills\\ncontribute to the success of an agile team\\nand performing these skills can be a big shift for some.\\nSo let's embrace learning\\nand practicing the agile mindset and values.\\nIt's a journey, not a point in time.\\nIt's an intentional and concentrated practice,\\none of evaluating your past and present behaviors\\nand thinking about how to change them\\ninto a more agile manner.\\n\\nIt's a journey of reflecting on\\nhow we can continuously improve\\nand adapt with others to reduce risk, get value sooner,\\nand work in complex environments more effectively.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5202673\",\"duration\":216,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Key agile values and principles for

principles of the Agile Manifesto.\\nThe 12 principles of the Agile Manifesto bring clarity\\nto what being Agile truly means.\\nIt's about being Agile in our behaviors and mindset.\\nThe principles don't talk about analysis specifically,\\nbut they are still very meaningful\\nand impact analysis in big ways.\\n\\nHere are some of the highlights\\nfrom a few of my favorite Agile principles\\nto help us understand Agile\\nin relationship to business analysis and requirements.\\nPrinciple number 1,\\nour highest priority is to satisfy the customer\\nthrough early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\\nYour role in helping ensure that each sprint\\nor iteration delivers something usable is key.\\nBAs facilitate the dialogue\\nthat helps the product owner prioritize\\nwhat the team builds and in what order.\\n\\nBusiness leaders see large chunks of functionality,\\nand the technical team focuses on technical components\\nand technical layers.\\nAs a BA, you help bridge this big-picture thinking\\nwith the details.\\nYou advocate for small increments of value\\nthat users can see and experience in order to give feedback.\\nNext, principle number 2,\\nwe welcome changing requirements even late in development.\\n\\nAgile processes harness change\\nfor the customer's competitive advantage.\\nAs BAs, we facilitate the team\\nin discovering emerging thoughts and ideas\\nthat will make the product more valuable.\\nFixed scope is out, emerging scope is in.\\nExternal market changes,\\nbusiness changes, technology advancements,\\nand feedback from customers continuously influence\\nthe product needs.\\nBAs help incorporate this feedback\\ninto the product backlog and priorities.\\n\\nChanging requirements are good.\\nThey mean the product is getting better\\nthan previously imagined.\\nOkay, next is number 7,\\nworking software is the primary measure of progress.\\nAgile teams demonstrate progress with working product,\\nnot documents about it.\\nWe want feedback associated with something working\\nto guide our detailed requirements and designs.\\nWe want to increment and iterate.\\nWe want to accumulate value, not risk.\\n\\nValue is accumulated\\nwhen we get quick feedback loops in place,\\nso we're not working and unknowingly off track for long.\\nLast but certainly not least,\\nmy favorite one, principle number 10,\\nsimplicity, the art of maximizing\\nthe amount of work not done is essential.\\nWait a minute, what does that say?\\nYep, maximize what's not done.\\nBAs ensure that many backlog items actually never get done.\\n\\nBut why?\\nBecause the BA and product owner are working together\\nto make sure only the most valuable things get done.\\nFocus, feedback, and change are the key themes here\\nto keep our analysis and delivery aligned and value-driven.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4297921\",\"duration\":187,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Agile ways of working for

BAs.\\nOkay, first, when and where the details happen.\\n\\nDesign details like what database field to use,\\nthe exact details and how the screen is designed\\nand the exact text of messages displayed to users\\nare things we work on together with the development team\\nand in real time.\\nAgile teams work hard\\nto not document these types of details upfront.\\nThese types of details are

continuous analysis.\\nAnalysis should not be a phase,\\nbut rather a continuous part of the work the team does.\\nWe work to avoid waste and increase quality\\nand value by using continuous analysis.\\nWe focus on continuously improving the solution\\nas we work not only working on a perfectly planned\\nand defined scope, we are constantly improving\\nand reflecting with the team and

project\\nwith things transparent\\nfrom a user and business perspective,\\nand a business leader can attach meaning to this,\\nmeaning to help them run their business team.\\nImagine if we could see\\nthe same level of transparency for our team's work.\\nTransparency is really important to agile teams\\nand how they manage expectations.\\nA business analyst work can directly impact\\nhow transparent the team is\\nand how well others understand the team's work.\\n\\nWithout this transparency,\\nteams often fight micromanaging\\nfrom leaders who really do not understand the status,\\nand often find themselves too busy\\nwith administration, questions,\\nand status meetings to explain things\\nand more status reporting.\\nOur planning in Agile asks us\\nto plan from a

team in a backlog refinement session.\\nUser story splitting helps ensure the team can estimate,\\ncommit, and plan the work.\\n\\nA common mistake teams make is splitting the user story\\nby breaking it into technical tasks.\\nThis is task planning, not user stories.\\nRemember, user stories are meant\\nto be independent, demoable,\\nand we want feedback on them from users.\\nIf user stories are

story.\\nAs a customer, I want to pay with a gift card\\nso I can use the gift to buy something I want.\\nNext, let's slice this story.\\nIt's likely too big for the team to commit\\nto developing in

Since we don't have unlimited time and resources  \\n to address the various needs of the organization,  \\n we need to document our findings in a manner  \\n that helps with the prioritization of work to be done.  \\n As we do our needs assessment,  \\n we need to gather relevant data  \\n to make sure that we understand the magnitude  \\n of the problem or opportunity.  \\n This helps us make sure that we properly size the solution.  \\n Once we understand the need,  \\n with the supporting data,  \\n the business analyst drafts a situation statement  \\n to provide not just what the situation was  \\n that we encountered,  \\n but also the impact on the organization.  \\n The first part of a situation statement  \\n states the current problem to be solved  \\n or the opportunity that needs to be explored  \\n in a structured manner.  \\n The second part then identifies the impact  \\n of that situation on the organization.  \\n The format of this statement is:  \\n the problem or opportunity has the effect  \\n of X on the organization  \\n with the resulting impact of Y.  \\n So here's an example.  \\n The existing process for processing returns  \\n involves the need to submit paperwork  \\n duplicating the digital record.  \\n This results in significant delays and extra labor costs.  \\n The impact is that additional staff is hired  \\n to meet established quotas.  \\n It's critical to review this with the key stakeholders  \\n to make sure we've captured the situation correctly,  \\n so that we can develop a proposed solution  \\n that addresses the real problem or opportunity.  \\n One of the most commonly used tools  \\n to help correctly understand the situation  \\n is an Ishikawa diagram  \\n for documenting a root cause analysis of the problem.  \\n Another tool which is used in adaptive or agile projects  \\n is the five whys.  \\n We can also create models of the flow of processes  \\n to help discover where problems might exist,  \\n and then recommend solutions.  \\n We might recommend a solution  \\n by just making a modification to the current process  \\n without any additional resources needed.  \\n Once we've defined the situation,  \\n it's time to move on to a potential solution.  \\n The solution is something that is developed  \\n to deliver measurable business value.  \\n It could be a new product,  \\n components of a product,  \\n an enhancement of an existing product,  \\n or just a fix.  \\n The solution statement recommends  \\n the most viable option to meet the need.  \\n The solution statement or approach defines at a high level  \\n the areas to be included or the initial scope  \\n and possible steps to move from the current situation  \\n or state to a future state.  \\n If there are multiple options,  \\n weighted criteria may also be used  \\n to propose the best option  \\n that will be further expanded upon in the business case.  \\n Before developing a final solution statement,  \\n we may need to do a feasibility study  \\n to help gather more information.  \\n This may include reviewing operational capability  \\n and the ability to either change or sustain the change.  \\n This may include  \\n whether the solution is technically feasible,  \\n whether it might work in the current environment,  \\n as well as help estimating potential cost  \\n or time requirements.  \\n We never want to provide only one solution.  \\n Instead, we provide multiple options.  \\n This allows the stakeholders to choose the one  \\n they think has the best chance of success.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

 \\n Sometimes, we don't even know who these people are.  \\n Here's an example that might help you start  \\n thinking more broadly about stakeholders.  \\n So, one of my neighbors was doing some construction.  \\n He got the permits from the city.  \\n He hired the trucks,  \\n and notified the neighborhood  \\n that some big equipment would be making noise  \\n and, occasionally, blocking the road.  \\n But what he didn't realize was  \\n that the dirt kicked up from the construction  \\n would land on everyone's solar panels.  \\n Everybody was furious because, now,  \\n they had to get their panels professionally cleaned.  \\n The takeaway, here, is this:  \\n those stakeholders, or neighbors, really,  \\n who had solar panels were impacted by the construction.  \\n He wasn't aware that those stakeholders  \\n would be impacted by his work.  \\n So what do we need to do?  \\n We need to make sure we know who our stakeholders are.  \\n Once we understand the need,  \\n the business analyst has to identify anyone  \\n who might be impacted by what we have been analyzing.  \\n These are usually referred to as \\\"stakeholders.\\\"  \\n The definition of a stakeholder is  \\n \\\"any individual, group, or organization  \\n that may be affected by,  \\n or perceive itself to be affected by,  \\n or can impact a decision, activity, or outcome  \\n of a program or project.\\\"  \\n Stakeholders can include several people:  \\n the group or individuals who initially propose the study,  \\n those who will benefit from the solution,  \\n those who have special knowledge of the current situation,  \\n and those that will use, support, or implement the result.  \\n So yes, stakeholders are often thought of  \\n as those affected by the project.  \\n But we also need to consider those stakeholders  \\n who will be affecting us.  \\n Usually, it's regulatory groups.  \\n For example, if you need to get a permit  \\n and it takes forever to get it approved,  \\n that can impact your schedule.  \\n Any group, either internal or external,  \\n that requires specific compliance  \\n can impact your work.  \\n An example of an internal stakeholder might be purchasing.  \\n Likely, they have a set of vendors you can buy from.  \\n But they don't realize that  \\n what you need to buy has to be compliant  \\n with certain standards.  \\n And the approved vendors don't comply.  \\n So you can't buy what you need.  \\n You can now see how the notion of a stakeholder can vary.  \\n The BA needs to be aware of and anticipate  \\n what impact they may have on the project.  \\n So how many stakeholders do we usually engage with?  \\n Well, it depends.  \\n But it's never a small number.  \\n Identifying your stakeholders is  \\n just part of the challenge,  \\n but it's important that we know  \\n who we are impacting  \\n and who may have an impact on us.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4362159\",\"duration\":198,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Classifying your stakeholders\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_en_US_03_02_2022Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to classify stakeholders.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3008774,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Not all stakeholders are created equal.  \\n Some have a vision and some are deep down in the weeds.  \\n The first thing you need to ask yourself is this.  \\n Who have I been given, and who do I really need?

 \\n How much detail? Which details?  \\n Have a conversation with your stakeholders  \\n to make sure you're on the same page  \\n with their expectations.  \\n You'll also want to determine the timeframe  \\n and frequency of communication.  \\n But this doesn't mean that the stakeholder  \\n can order information from you like a menu.  \\n We have to understand the reason  \\n that specific information is required at that time  \\n and what the expected result or impact will be upon receipt.  \\n As the project progresses,  \\n we need to continue monitoring  \\n how we will keep the stakeholders engaged.  \\n We'll always have new stakeholders join in the project  \\n while other stakeholders remove themselves.  \\n Continual monitoring  \\n of the involvement of stakeholders is important.  \\n This allows us to determine why involvement may have changed  \\n and whether additional engagements are needed.  \\n Here's a final tip that's always helped me:  \\n figure out how much time you need  \\n for individual stakeholders,  \\n especially those that are executives.  \\n Then preschedule them for the times when you need them.  \\n Reserve dates and times  \\n for meetings with these stakeholders.  \\n They're going to be surprised  \\n by how much of their time you really need.  \\n You need to continually remind them, though,  \\n of their importance to the result of the project.  \\n By the end of the project,  \\n you want to make sure they feel their engagement  \\n was well worth the time spent.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

Requirements come in all shapes and forms,  \\n but don't let that confuse you.  \\n In a nutshell, requirements are what we need to do,  \\n they're what we need to do to satisfy the customer.  \\n But what the customer puts in their list  \\n of requirements isn't necessarily what we'll eventually do.  \\n It's a wish list that gives us a direction,  \\n and depending on where you work, or who the client is,  \\n these requirements come to us in different formats.  \\n It's our job to interpret that list,  \\n and then determine the most appropriate way  \\n to fulfill the customer's needs.  \\n So let's review the different types of requirements.  \\n There are six major categories.  \\n First, the business requirements.  \\n They represent the higher level needs of the organization.  \\n Usually business requirements are identified  \\n through the needs assessment process,  \\n as either issues or opportunities.  \\n They're the reason why the project was selected  \\n and justified in the first place.  \\n The stakeholder requirements describe the needs  \\n of individual stakeholders, or groups of stakeholders.  \\n These requirements could come from within the organization,  \\n internally, or from customers, suppliers, partners,  \\n or other external organizations.  \\n Solution requirements describe the features, functions,  \\n and characteristics of the result.  \\n By result, I mean this is what the customer wants  \\n at the end of our work.  \\n Solution requirements have two subcategories,  \\n functional and nonfunctional requirements.  \\n Functional requirements describe what the user  \\n will be able to do, or what they'll receive when we're done.  \\n So this could be something like an online shopping site  \\n being able to process orders or returns.  \\n This type of requirement is just a high level example  \\n of the features to be included.  \\n Nonfunctional requirements on the other hand,  \\n describe environment, or quality of service conditions.  \\n These can also include technology requirements.  \\n An example might be the security requirements  \\n for your online store's credit card processing.  \\n Another category, transition requirements.  \\n These include the activities who help transition  \\n from the current state to the desired future state.  \\n These include training, documentation, and possibly  \\n conversion and implementation requirements.  \\n Now the next set of requirements are interesting  \\n because these are the responsibilities  \\n of the project manager, not the business analyst,  \\n but we still need to know them  \\n to have a full picture of the process.  \\n I'm talking about project requirements.  \\n They're often specified by either agreements  \\n or internal procedures.  \\n They include processes and deliverables  \\n to ensure that the project is completed on time.  \\n These may include management reviews,  \\n status updates, and performance reports.  \\n The last set of requirements identify  \\n the quality levels required.  \\n They're the responsibility of either a quality analyst  \\n or a group, like quality assurance.  \\n These include the conditions or capability used  \\n to assess conformance to the requirements.  \\n Regardless of the type of requirement,  \\n it's important to define how requirements  \\n will be managed and tracked.  \\n To do this, you use the requirements management plan,  \\n and the traceability matrix, but don't worry about that,  \\n we'll address those in another video.  \\n What's important is managing and understanding requirements,  \\n because this helps you control the scope.  \\n Once you finalize your requirements  \\n and scope boundaries, stick to them.  \\n Requirements start out as an unreprioritized wishlist,  \\n so it's important to be clear  \\n about exactly which ones have been selected.  \\n That way you're more likely to provide the greatest value.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4364147\",\"duration\":237,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Requirements elicitation techniques\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_en_US_06_02_2022Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to identify different elicitation techniques.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3583022,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - There are lots of ways to do elicitation,  \\n and you'll want to customize your strategy to each situation.  \\n Different stakeholders mean different elicitation  \\n techniques.  \\n One common technique  \\n uses structured or facilitated sessions.  \\n You have a facilitator that guides the conversation  \\n of the participants, prompts brainstorming,  \\n and makes sure that the session fulfills its goal.  \\n Facilitated workshops are great for a couple of reasons.  \\n One, they can be used throughout the project.  \\n It allows us to make the elicitation process  \\n truly iterative.  \\n Two, you can bring cross-functional participants together.  \\n Having diverse participants naturally uncovers gaps,  \\n redundancies, needs, and other important information.  \\n Finally, having a facilitator means someone is there  \\n to help with communication between stakeholders,  \\n leading to better relationships and consensus.  \\n Interviews have been used for years.  \\n They're basically three loose categories  \\n of interview styles.  \\n Highly structured, with predefined questions.  \\n Semi-structured, with some prepared questions,  \\n and follow up on answers or,  \\n unstructured interviews where you allow the conversation  \\n to develop naturally.  \\n These are most appropriate when confidential  \\n or sensitive information is needed,  \\n or the information is needed from high level managers.  \\n You can do these face to face, over the phone,  \\n video conferences, through email,  \\n or even have the person record the responses  \\n into an audio file.  \\n In addition, we collect and analyze existing documentation.  \\n A major focus of our analysis is to ask,  \\n \\\"Why certain information is even there?\\\"  \\n The answer, \\\"Because it's always been done that way,\\\"  \\n is not a valid response.  \\n What I've often done is have the stakeholders  \\n take the documentation of a process,  \\n and literally circle what they use or don't.  \\n It can be a really revealing process for them  \\n and it's a quick way for me to get to the heart  \\n of what matters and what doesn't.  \\n You could also try shadowing people  \\n in their environment while performing their duties.  \\n If you have a large number of stakeholders  \\n use questionnaires and surveys.  \\n Remember though that open-ended questions  \\n obtain more detailed responses,  \\n but will require additional time to consolidate.  \\n One word of caution here, the process can get very lengthy.  \\n You want to be thorough,  \\n but don't fall into analysis paralysis.  \\n Constrain yourself to two phases.  \\n One, initial elicitation  \\n during the needs assessment activities.  \\n A second discovery is done after the project  \\n has been initiated.  \\n It's an iterative process.  \\n Okay.  \\n You have to choose your elicitation techniques.  \\n This is what you should consider,  \\n the type of project and approach used,  \\n time and budget constraints,  \\n number and location of stakeholders,  \\n and requirement documentation type and detail required.  \\n So regardless of the technique you choose,  \\n elicitation activities take up project resources.  \\n So choose wisely so your time spent appropriately  \\n defines the product solution.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4361190\",\"duration\":218,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using requirements modeling techniques\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_en_US_06_03_2022Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to use process and data modeling.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3292830,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Let's talk about the importance  \\n of modeling business requirements.  \\n As a business analyst,  \\n you're very important to the project effort  \\n because of your ability to not just discover requirements,  \\n but also to analyze those requirements.  \\n To best wrap our mind around this,  \\n we develop various models  \\n to look at requirements from three points of view,  \\n nouns, verbs, and rules.  \\n Let's take the example.  \\n I, as a customer, want to order a camera  \\n to take photos of my family.  \\n If you break the requirement down,  \\n \\\"to order\\\" is the verb and the \\\"camera\\\" is the noun.  \\n Keep in mind though  \\n that there are some unspoken rules in there, too.  \\n You'll utilize two key models  \\n to break the requirements down.  \\n One for the process or verbs, call process modeling,  \\n and one for the data or nouns, call data modeling.  \\n Easy to remember, right?  \\n So we create the process model firs.  \\n To understand the various steps required,  \\n you'll be looking for those verbs.  \\n One of the best methods to do this is  \\n by having a face-to-face discussion  \\n with your business stakeholders at a white board.  \\n You can use the board to take notes, sketch drawings,  \\n and capture the discussion.  \\n Start by drawing out the order  \\n in which things happen, your verbs.  \\n That will complete your process model.  \\n Next, ask what's the noun or the product.  \\n Cameras? Customers?  \\n Are there different types of cameras  \\n or different types of customers?  \\n We use what's called data modeling techniques  \\n to figure it out.  \\n Now, picture yourself adding your nouns or products  \\n to the whiteboard on stickies.  \\n The first part of the data modeling technique is done.  \\n And now you can move on to the business rule model.  \\n Let's refer back to what we already know.  \\n Our nouns and verbs are what make the rules.  \\n Picture yourself with your stakeholder, again.  \\n You'll be listening during the discussion  \\n for relationships and differences.  \\n Here's a pro tip.  \\n Stickies are an effective way to show the differences,  \\n in this case,  \\n between different types of customers and cameras.  \\n Once identified, these rules identify the steps  \\n that apply for individual customers,  \\n as well as any pricing discounts that might apply.  \\n Now, the process model, data model,  \\n and business rule model will help you  \\n analyze requirements individually.  \\n But the real power comes from bringing it all together.  \\n Don't worry if you don't have formal complete models.  \\n Fragments of requirements still help you know  \\n what steps are needed to fulfill an order request,  \\n which exact product is being requested,  \\n what price is being charged  \\n depending on the product and the customer, et cetera.  \\n If you can map everything together,  \\n you'll be able to deliver a solution  \\n that exceeds the customer's expectations  \\n while still following the rules  \\n established by the organization.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"6.

Since we don't have unlimited time and resources  \\n to address the various needs of the organization,  \\n we need to document our findings in a manner  \\n that helps with the prioritization of work to be done.  \\n As we do our needs assessment,  \\n we need to gather relevant data  \\n to make sure that we understand the magnitude  \\n of the problem or opportunity.  \\n This helps us make sure  \\n that we properly size the solution.  \\n Once we understand the need with the supporting data,  \\n the business analyst drafts a situation statement  \\n to provide not just what the situation was  \\n that we encountered,  \\n but also the impact on the organization.  \\n The first part of a situation statement  \\n states the current problem to be solved  \\n or the opportunity that needs to be explored  \\n in a structured manner.  \\n The second part then identifies the impact  \\n of that situation on the organization.  \\n The format of this statement is the problem or opportunity  \\n has the effect of x on the organization  \\n with the resulting impact of y.  \\n So here's an example.  \\n The existing process for processing returns  \\n involves the need to submit paperwork  \\n duplicating the digital record.  \\n This results in significant delays  \\n and extra labor costs.  \\n The impact is that additional staff is hired  \\n to meet established quotas.  \\n It's critical to review this with the key stakeholders  \\n to make sure we've captured the situation correctly,  \\n so that we can develop a proposed solution  \\n that addresses the real problem or opportunity.  \\n One of the most commonly used tools  \\n to help correctly understand the situation  \\n is an Ishikawa diagram  \\n for documenting a root cause analysis of the problem.  \\n Another tool which is used in adaptive or agile projects  \\n is the Five Why's.  \\n We can also create models of the flow of processes  \\n to help discover where problems might exist,  \\n and then recommend solutions.  \\n We might recommend a solution  \\n by just making a modification to the current process  \\n without any additional resources needed.  \\n Once we define the situation,  \\n it's time to move on to a potential solution.  \\n The solution is something that is developed  \\n to deliver measurable business value.  \\n It could be a new product, components of a product,  \\n an enhancement of an existing product, or just a fix.  \\n The solution statement recommends  \\n the most viable option to meet the need.  \\n The solution statement or approach defines at a high level  \\n the areas to be included or the initial scope,  \\n and possible steps to move  \\n from the current situation or state to a future state.  \\n If there are multiple options,  \\n weighted criteria may also be used  \\n to propose the best option  \\n that will be further expanded upon in the business case.  \\n Before developing a final solution statement,  \\n we may need to do a feasibility study  \\n to help gather more information.  \\n This may include reviewing operational capability  \\n and the ability to either change or sustain the change.  \\n This may include whether the solution  \\n is technically feasible,  \\n whether it might work in the current environment,  \\n as well as help estimating potential costs  \\n or time requirements.  \\n We never want to provide only one solution.  \\n Instead, we provide multiple options.  \\n This allows the stakeholders to choose the one  \\n they think has the best chance of success.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

 \\n Sometimes we don't even know who these people are.  \\n Here's an example that might help you start thinking  \\n more broadly about stakeholders.  \\n So one of my neighbors was doing some construction.  \\n He got the permits from the city,  \\n he hired the trucks  \\n and notified the neighborhood  \\n that some big equipment would be making noise  \\n and occasionally blocking the road.  \\n But what he didn't realize was that the dirt kicked up  \\n from the construction would land on everyone's solar panels.  \\n Everybody was furious because now they had to get their  \\n panels professionally cleaned.  \\n The takeaway here is this,  \\n those stakeholders or neighbors really  \\n who had solar panels were impacted by the construction.  \\n He wasn't aware that those stakeholders  \\n would be impacted by his work.  \\n So what do we need to do?  \\n We need to make sure we know who our stakeholders are.  \\n Once we understand the need,  \\n the business analyst has to identify anyone  \\n who might be impacted by what we have been analyzing.  \\n These are usually referred to as stakeholders.  \\n The definition of a stakeholder is any individual, group  \\n or organization that may be affected by  \\n or perceive itself to be affected by  \\n or can impact a decision activity  \\n or outcome of a program or project.  \\n Stakeholders can include several people,  \\n the group or individuals who initially proposed the study,  \\n those who will benefit from the solution,  \\n those who have special knowledge of the current situation  \\n and those that will use, support  \\n or implement the result.  \\n So yes, stakeholders are often thought of  \\n as those affected by the project.  \\n But we also need to consider those stakeholders  \\n who will be affecting us.  \\n Usually, it's regulatory groups.  \\n For example, if you need to get a permit  \\n and it takes forever to get it approved,  \\n that can impact your schedule.  \\n Any group, either internal or external  \\n that requires specific compliance can impact your work.  \\n An example of an internal stakeholder might be purchasing,  \\n likely they have a set of vendors you can buy from.  \\n But they don't realize that what you need to buy  \\n has to be compliant with certain standards.  \\n And the approved vendors don't comply,  \\n so you can't buy what you need.  \\n You can now see how the notion of a stakeholder can vary.  \\n The BA needs to be aware of  \\n and anticipate what impact they may have on the project.  \\n So how many stakeholders do we usually engage with?  \\n Well, it depends,  \\n but it's never a small number.  \\n Identifying your stakeholders is just part of the challenge,  \\n but it's important that we know who we are impacting  \\n and who may have an impact on us.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2911934\",\"duration\":198,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Classifying your stakeholders\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_03_02_MM30_classify\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3020352,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Not all stakeholders are created equal.  \\n Some have a vision and some are deep down in the weeds.  \\n The first thing you need to ask yourself is this.  \\n Who've I been given and who do I really need?

Requirements come in all shapes and forms,  \\n but don't let that confuse you.  \\n In a nutshell,  \\n requirements are what we need to do.  \\n They're what we need to do to satisfy the customer,  \\n but what the customer puts in their list of requirements  \\n isn't necessarily what we'll eventually do.  \\n It's a wishlist that gives us a direction  \\n and depending on where you work or who the client is,  \\n these requirements come to us in different formats.  \\n It's our job to interpret that list  \\n and then determine the most appropriate way  \\n to fulfill the customer's needs.  \\n So, let's review the different types of requirements.  \\n There are six major categories.  \\n First, the business requirements.  \\n They represent the higher-level needs of the organization.  \\n Usually, business requirements are identified  \\n through the needs assessment process  \\n as either issues or opportunities.  \\n They're the reason why the project was selected  \\n and justified in the first place.  \\n The stakeholder requirements describe the needs  \\n of individual stakeholders or groups of stakeholders.  \\n These requirements could come  \\n from within the organization, internally  \\n or from customers, suppliers,  \\n partners or other external organizations.  \\n Solution requirements describe the features, functions  \\n and characteristics of the result.  \\n By result I mean,  \\n this is what the customer wants at the end of our work.  \\n Solution requirements have two sub categories,  \\n functional and nonfunctional requirements.  \\n Functional requirements describe  \\n what the user will be able to do  \\n or what they'll receive when we're done.  \\n So, this could be something like an online shopping site  \\n being able to process orders or returns.  \\n This type of requirement is just a high-level example  \\n of the features to be included.  \\n Nonfunctional requirements on the other hand,  \\n describe environment or quality of service conditions.  \\n These can also include technology requirements.  \\n An example might be the security requirements  \\n for your online store's credit card processing.  \\n Another category, transition requirements.  \\n These include the activities to help transition  \\n from the current state to the desired future state.  \\n These include training, documentation  \\n and possibly conversion and implementation requirements.  \\n Now, the next set of requirements are interesting  \\n because these are the responsibilities  \\n of the project manager not the business analyst,  \\n but we still need to know them  \\n to have a full picture of the process.  \\n I'm talking about project requirements.  \\n They're often specified by either agreements  \\n or internal procedures.  \\n They include processes and deliverables  \\n to ensure that the project is completed on time.  \\n These may include management reviews,  \\n status updates and performance reports.  \\n The last set of requirements  \\n identify the quality levels required.  \\n They're the responsibility of either a quality analyst  \\n or a group like quality assurance.  \\n These include the conditions or capability used  \\n to assess conformance to the requirements.  \\n Regardless of the type of requirement,  \\n it's important to define  \\n how requirements will be managed and tracked.  \\n To do this,  \\n and the traceability matrix,  \\n but don't worry about that,  \\n we'll address those in another video.  \\n What's important is managing and understanding requirements,  \\n because this helps you control the scope.  \\n Once you finalized your requirements and scope boundaries,  \\n stick to them.  \\n Requirements start out as an unprioritized wishlist.  \\n So, it's important to be clear  \\n about exactly which ones have been selected.  \\n That way you're more likely to provide the greatest value.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2917000\",\"duration\":237,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Requirements elicitation techniques\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_06_02_MM30_ellicitation\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Identify and describe different types of elicitation techniques.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3587467,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

Throughout the world organizations use models and modeling  \\n as a cost effective way to share and demonstrate  \\n the concepts and designs to larger audiences to receive  \\n feedback on what is to come.  \\n You may know this as prototyping.  \\n Organizations use business process modeling tools  \\n in the same way to determine  \\n what is being performed today in our current state  \\n and what is planned as the expected future state.  \\n Process modeling captures the interrelationships  \\n between the people, processes, activities,  \\n and systems in delivering the expected outcome.  \\n I want to share with you the four most commonly used  \\n business modeling tools at a high level overview.  \\n The first tool is referred to as the Context Diagram.  \\n The context diagram provides the high level framework  \\n and interaction of an organization.  \\n The context diagram depicts the organization  \\n that has been analyzed as shown as a circle.  \\n The external entities that connect  \\n to the area or system being analyzed, represented by boxes.  \\n And lastly, the relationship of interactions  \\n between the organization and the external entities.  \\n These are shown as the arrows.  \\n Our focus here are the interrelationships and activities  \\n that are either initiated or needed by the organization.  \\n We now arrive at our next diagram  \\n the Functional Flow Diagram.  \\n The functional flow diagram is a simple model showing  \\n the functional areas or stakeholders internally  \\n to our organization and how they interact in a logical  \\n overall flow of work.  \\n The functional flow diagram always starts  \\n with a stakeholder, usually the customer or another entity  \\n external to the organization, initiating a transaction.  \\n Stakeholders and internal functional areas  \\n are captured in the ovals.  \\n Then, the appropriate relationships and workflows are drawn  \\n between these stakeholder groups.  \\n As we continue our journey down in to the next level  \\n of detail, we start creating Cross-Functional Flow Diagrams  \\n as a way to capture and sequentially display  \\n the activities that are performed.  \\n Cross-functional flow diagrams also referred  \\n to as activity diagrams, and swimlane diagrams.  \\n The stakeholders also referred to as actors in the process.  \\n Remembering an actor can be a person,  \\n system or functional area.  \\n These diagrams organize activity sequences that displays  \\n the process in the context of the actors responsible  \\n for performing the work.  \\n This added structure makes it very easy to read and quickly  \\n identifies the individual actors work  \\n as well as cross-functional interactions needed.  \\n These diagrams are very effective in visually sharing  \\n a process is performed from start to finish,  \\n and what each and every stakeholder or actor needs  \\n to perform to enable completion of the activity.  \\n Finally, we come to the fourth type of model  \\n known as process flow charting.  \\n These traditional process flow models  \\n show the sequential flow of activities, decision points,  \\n and other interactions.  \\n Process Flow models are used as a way to capture  \\n the step by step procedures and activities performed  \\n by an individual actor.  \\n These processes describe who and what has to be involved  \\n in fully responding to an event, or how people  \\n in the enterprise collaborate to achieve a goal.  \\n These process workflow models are the low level detail  \\n not represented in the cross functional swimlane models.  \\n By visually starting with the big picture,  \\n we cascade into finer detail and create the fourth business  \\n process modeling diagrams.  \\n The context diagram, the functional flow diagram,  \\n the cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n and the process flowchart.  \\n These four business process models should now form the basis  \\n of your business process modeling toolbox.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2330908\",\"duration\":191,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Modeling consistency and standards\",\"fileName\":\"490754_00_04_MM30_Modeling_2020Q2\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, discover the most commonly used modeling symbols, best practices, and international standards.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2903197,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

- Have you ever been in a situation  \\n where you've had to make a decision quickly  \\n or had someone call to you from in another room  \\n and ask you a question like,  \\n \\\"Can we make the change now?\\\"  \\n What is it that they want to change and why?  \\n Before you can answer this seemingly simple question,  \\n you need to ensure you understand the context.  \\n The same is true if you need to analyze  \\n a business unit or an organization.  \\n Before you can delve into the detail  \\n of what an organization does, or more importantly,  \\n make or suggest changes,  \\n you first need to understand where and how  \\n the organization fits into the big picture of things.  \\n The context diagram provides a visual view  \\n of how the organization fits within the outside world  \\n and is viewed at the highest level.  \\n In a way it becomes the checklist for future analysis  \\n as each component can be analyzed by drilling down  \\n into other detail.  \\n The context diagram is the perfect at-a-glance tool  \\n to show where the organization fits  \\n in the greater scheme of things.  \\n Every organization interacts with external entities.  \\n These external entities are represented  \\n by the boxes in the diagram.  \\n They may include the customer, suppliers,  \\n banks, contractors, and so on.  \\n They're essentially any external entity,  \\n the organization shares a relationship with.  \\n These relationships are shown  \\n by the interactions coming into or from the organization.  \\n In the example, we see that the customer  \\n places a purchase order against the organization.  \\n The organization sends the products  \\n and invoice back to the customer.  \\n And the customer then makes payment to the organization.  \\n The organization deposits the money into the bank and so on.  \\n A context diagram is a tool that can be used  \\n in a number of situations.  \\n It's a great way to understand the relationship  \\n the organization has between the various external entities.  \\n This high level knowledge enables you  \\n to identify any significant impacts  \\n that a change through an organization may have  \\n and the way they interact with the outside world.  \\n By providing context around  \\n how the organization interacts externally,  \\n you can then start to build an understanding  \\n of the functions required within the organization  \\n to support these interactions.  \\n Another great use for a context diagram  \\n is when explaining the scope of a project  \\n and how it fits in within the organization.  \\n Let's say you're working on a billing system.  \\n A system context diagram can communicate  \\n to your stakeholders how the new system will interact  \\n with the various internal business units  \\n and external business partners, if any.  \\n When using this tool to communicate to key stakeholders,  \\n they can quickly identify the relationships  \\n that need to change.  \\n These changes become the scope and analysis  \\n of what needs to be performed as part of the project.  \\n If you're someone new to the organization,  \\n creating a context diagram is a great way for you  \\n to quickly gain an understanding of the organization  \\n and how it interacts.  \\n In fact, it's a great starting point  \\n with any analysis you need to do.  \\n Context diagrams are wonderful visual modeling techniques  \\n that provide the overall view of the area  \\n in which you'll be interacting with  \\n and how it all fits together.  \\n So next time you're asked a simple question  \\n on whether or not you can make the change,  \\n creating and understanding the context  \\n will enable you to make a better  \\n and more informed decision.  \\n

Ask any great photographer,  \\n and they'll tell you that you need certain building blocks  \\n to create an awesome shot.  \\n Lighting, structure, depth, a good subject matter,  \\n and a moment in time  \\n that they wish to capture through their lens.  \\n Photographers also use different lenses  \\n for different distances and expected detail.  \\n Context diagrams represent the overall panoramic photograph  \\n depicting the highest level.  \\n The following definitions assist  \\n in framing the context diagram.  \\n Context.  \\n How a business area, system, process,  \\n organizational area being analyzed,  \\n interacts with the world.  \\n Actor.  \\n A person, department, or system  \\n that is directly involved  \\n with the business area being analyzed.  \\n External entity.  \\n A person, department, organization, or system  \\n that interacts with the business area,  \\n but is not being analyzed.  \\n They can be the source or destination of data  \\n outside of the system.  \\n Analysis considers only the inputs or outputs,  \\n but does not review the external entity's processes  \\n or systems.  \\n Context diagrams also leverage three common components,  \\n or building blocks.  \\n Entities,  \\n relationships,  \\n and processes.  \\n All of which are needed in creating that perfect,  \\n high-level diagram.  \\n Entities are the elements or actors  \\n that represent each player  \\n that fits within the context of the diagram.  \\n They can be shown in any way that provides clarity  \\n and helps the reader identify them easily.  \\n It's not uncommon to see these entities represented  \\n and labeled in boxes.  \\n Within those boxes you may find ovals, stick figures,  \\n or even graphics of paper art,  \\n as long as it fits within the message you wish to convey.  \\n However, when creating a context diagram  \\n for the organization you're analyzing,  \\n you would use a circle to represent the main entity,  \\n and use boxes around the outside  \\n to represent the external entities.  \\n A circle is used as it indicates what you have control of.  \\n In this case, what goes on internal to your organization  \\n lives inside the circle,  \\n whereas a box indicates  \\n what your organization only has an influence over.  \\n It's all very well and good  \\n to have all the entities identified,  \\n but what really provides the context we are looking for  \\n are the relationships between each of them.  \\n This is done with arrows or flows.  \\n The flows represent the relationship  \\n between the two entities.  \\n The direction of the flow  \\n indicates whether the interaction is incoming or outgoing.  \\n These flows represent activities  \\n that the analyzing organization must perform  \\n and adhere to to ensure smooth interactions  \\n that pass between the two entities.  \\n One entity is sending an activity,  \\n also known as an output,  \\n and one is receiving the activity.  \\n And these are called inputs.  \\n Good modeling standards dictate that each relationship  \\n starts from one entity and finishes at another.  \\n The customer flows here clearly show  \\n incoming and outgoing interactions  \\n between the customer and the organization.  \\n These are the processes needed in achieving  \\n the expected outcome of the external entity.  \\n Each arrow represents the flow of information, data,  \\n products, artifacts being sent between the organization  \\n and the external entity.  \\n These flows should be labeled to provide further context.  \\n Always remember to keep your context diagram  \\n at the highest level.  \\n Rather than having a flow for each interaction,  \\n you can simplify your diagram  \\n by listing all the types of interactions on a single flow.  \\n These single flows represent the process.  \\n These processes can each be analyzed separately  \\n and drilled down to into more detail  \\n when you create your functional flow diagram.  \\n So just like framing that perfect photograph,  \\n the best context diagrams are simple, clear,  \\n uncluttered, and usually fit on one page.  \\n By utilizing the three fundamental features  \\n of a context diagram, entities, relationships,  \\n and processes,  \\n you start your business process modeling  \\n at the highest level,  \\n and creates the foundation for future  \\n and more detailed analysis.  \\n Context diagrams are the pictures  \\n in which the organization fits with the outside world,  \\n and becomes the diagram

As with any diagram,  \\n making complex things simple is the aim of the game.  \\n Too much detail, and people won't engage.  \\n But not enough detail,  \\n people will start to worry you missed something.  \\n Finding the right mix is essential.  \\n There are a few easy steps  \\n to creating a good context diagram,  \\n but before you can begin to piece together  \\n how the organization fits in the big picture,  \\n you first need to do some research.  \\n You can research the organization on the intranet,  \\n ask colleagues a lot of questions,  \\n or run a series of workshops  \\n with key people with business knowledge.  \\n In my experience, all of the above are great ways  \\n to begin building your knowledge  \\n and validate your context diagram.  \\n The important thing is to remember  \\n that this is the start of our business process modeling.  \\n We need to keep it simple and high level.  \\n As a rule of thumb, you should start with a single page.  \\n Why?  \\n Well, having a single page forces you  \\n to keep your diagram at the highest level.  \\n There's a tendency to dive into the detail  \\n and try and fit in too much information.  \\n If you find your page needs to be really big  \\n to fit everything in,  \\n then you're probably overcomplicating it  \\n and need to pull yourself back out of the detail.  \\n Start with the main entity that you wish  \\n to provide the context for  \\n by drawing a circle in the middle of the page  \\n with its name inside the circle.  \\n All interactions with the external entities will stem in  \\n and out from the circle.  \\n Remembering a circle is used to indicate  \\n what you have control over,  \\n what and how things happen within the organization.  \\n From your research and discussions,  \\n begin to add all the external stakeholders  \\n around the outside of the circle.  \\n As they are external to your organization,  \\n you will place them in a box.  \\n Each box will represent a single entity  \\n that interacts with the organization.  \\n Throughout the analysis,  \\n you'll become aware of more external entities.  \\n These can be added as you go.  \\n Remember, a box is used to represent entities  \\n where your organization only has influence over.  \\n An example of influence may be the ability  \\n to negotiate an agreement.  \\n You may need them to adapt to your needs, for instance,  \\n having them use a template supplied by your organization  \\n or complying with secure electronic bank standards.  \\n Not having control essentially means having  \\n to work within the constraints and constrictions imposed  \\n by their entity, such as legislation,  \\n regulations, industry and international standards.  \\n As you identify and place the external entities  \\n onto your diagram,  \\n begin to connect the relationships that occur  \\n between each external entity and your organization  \\n by drawing one directional arrow  \\n either coming or leaving the organization.  \\n Using the right angles  \\n for the relationship flows simplifies the diagram  \\n and enables greater area to label the flows.  \\n Then label the flows with what interactions are taking place  \\n and whether they are incoming or outgoing.  \\n Incoming relationship flows trigger the start  \\n of an internal activity within your organization.  \\n Once you have drafted your context diagram,  \\n it's essential to validate your analysis.  \\n Share the diagrams with others in the organization  \\n in seeking their view of who and what is involved.  \\n By keeping them in the loop,  \\n you give them the comfort of knowing that their processes  \\n and relationships are being included for further analysis  \\n and ensures you don't miss out on that

I don't know,\\\"  \\n to conscious competence,  \\n \\\"I now know and it starts to show.\\\"  \\n Investigating how organizations come together  \\n becomes easier once all the pieces fit into

diagram loses part of its value  \\n by being too complex.  \\n I want to share a few pitfalls that you can easily fall into  \\n when creating context diagrams.  \\n The most common is getting too detailed.  \\n Rather than having a flow for each interaction,  \\n you can simplify your diagram  \\n by listing all types of interactions on a single flow.  \\n These are called processes.  \\n These processes can each be analyzed separately  \\n and drilled down to in more detail  \\n when we create the next level of detail  \\n in the functional flow diagram.  \\n Let's take an example of an organization  \\n that has the bulk of its IT operations done overseas.  \\n If we were to mention every single overseas partner,  \\n the diagram would be difficult to read  \\n and would not create an easy at-a-glance view.  \\n Let's take a closer look at this example.  \\n Here, the organization has partnered  \\n with multiple external offshore businesses  \\n responsible for all the IT operational support  \\n for the organization.  \\n They have partnerships in Manila, India, Philippines,  \\n just to mention a few.  \\n As the information that needs to flow  \\n to the external provider,  \\n the delivered outcome from the external provider  \\n is the same.  \\n All entities can be grouped together and simply labeled  \\n offshore IT operations.  \\n If there are differences between how the interactions occur,  \\n these differences will come to light  \\n when you drill down into the next level,  \\n when you create your functional flow diagram  \\n for each entity's interactions.  \\n Context diagrams do have their limitations and weaknesses,  \\n as they do not  \\n indicate the internal functionality of the organization,  \\n indicate timing or system interaction  \\n with its external entities,  \\n and do not capture all the modes  \\n that relationships are undertaken.  \\n It is possible to create many different models  \\n of any one system.  \\n This may well be necessary at some point,  \\n but when initiating a modeling exercise,  \\n it is a best practice to start with the operational view  \\n and the way the system has been designed and installed  \\n to deliver on the day to day operations.  \\n Constructing a context diagram might also require several  \\n build review iterations.  \\n It is unlikely that a fully populated context diagram  \\n can be drawn first up.  \\n Be careful and be sure  \\n to always validate your information as you go.  \\n Even if the context diagram you're analyzing  \\n is not going to be socialized,  \\n you need to ensure that your foundation  \\n is accurate as possible  \\n before you delve into the next level of detail.  \\n By keeping the diagram simple,  \\n your stakeholders can be easily walked through  \\n each of the relationships  \\n without being distracted or losing focus.  \\n Once you've worked through a few context diagrams,  \\n you'll be thankful that you've always had  \\n the big picture reference to refer back to  \\n when you start drilling down  \\n into the other business process modeling.  \\n Hopefully you will then end up in an enviable place

Have you ever been in a situation  \\n when something that looks easy is hard than you expected?  \\n We use assumptions, things that we believe to be true,  \\n to fill in our gaps of knowledge,  \\n only then realizing what we don't know  \\n once we have to do it ourselves.  \\n Functional flow diagrams are one of the most overlooked  \\n of the modeling diagrams,  \\n because people make assumptions on how information  \\n and activities flow across  \\n and externally to and from our organizations.  \\n When you create a context diagram,  \\n you've established where your organization fits  \\n at the highest level.  \\n Now we can begin to explore each of the interactions  \\n the organization has.  \\n You look at each individual external entity  \\n and the functions within your organization  \\n that action or support these interactions.  \\n The functional flow diagram is a simple model showing  \\n each functional area or stakeholder  \\n internal to your organization,  \\n and how they interact in the logical overall flow of work.  \\n Starting with the external entity initiating the activity,  \\n your functional flow diagram will then capture  \\n the sequenced activities in completing a transaction.  \\n These diagrams are very effective  \\n in showing new users and executives  \\n the conceptual detail of how, internally,  \\n information, data and activities pass between  \\n the different functional areas of your organization.  \\n At no time does the functional flow diagram mention  \\n anything about how the activities are performed,  \\n merely that a function takes place.  \\n Remember, this is the second highest level  \\n of process modeling and should focus on a single interaction  \\n between the external entity and your organization.  \\n A great place to start determining the functional areas  \\n within your organization  \\n is to look at the organizational chart  \\n and which functional departments report  \\n into the most senior of management.  \\n While the accounts receivable and accounts payable areas  \\n of an organization are important functions,  \\n they normally report into the finance area.  \\n Functional flow diagrams are interested in the interactions  \\n between these main functional areas.  \\n The functional flow diagram can be used  \\n to target specific audiences when analyzing the detail  \\n within each functional area.  \\n It is a necessary tool as it ensures  \\n that you have covered all the touch points  \\n within your organization prior to documenting  \\n your cross functional flow diagram,  \\n which is the next level down.  \\n This level of processing is the perfect level  \\n for you to validate who your stakeholders are.  \\n When creating your functional flow diagram,  \\n you have the opportunity to ensure  \\n that stakeholders within your organization are questioned,  \\n and you can ascertain whether they are involved or not.  \\n The functional flow diagram analysis  \\n is a good initiation test in understanding  \\n who performs and owns the functional activities,  \\n what triggers the activity,  \\n and the time taken for these activities to be completed.  \\n Creating a functional flow diagram is as much for yourself  \\n than it is a desired deliverable for a project.  \\n Often it's a step you need to take  \\n to ensure coverage before moving  \\n into the next level of detail.  \\n If you don't get the basic functions mapped,  \\n then you'll be headed down the wrong path,  \\n and we know that assumptions will cause a lot of pain  \\n if you don't turn them into facts through your analysis.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2335082\",\"duration\":221,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Functional flow diagram features\",\"fileName\":\"490754_02_02_MM30_flow_2020Q2\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, explore the features of the functional flow diagram including common symbols and formatting options and the instances where you would apply each of them.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3347603,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

So where do you start?  \\n The answer always starts with the external entity  \\n whose relationship you are looking to analyze.  \\n In nearly all cases,  \\n it is the customer that initiates the process,  \\n based on their needs, wants or expectations.  \\n The functional flow diagram is the next level of detail.  \\n By focusing on a single external entity,  \\n you can map out what functions are required  \\n inside your organization,  \\n providing context to the relationship  \\n that you are now analyzing.  \\n Think of it a bit like a context diagram  \\n within a context diagram.  \\n Rather than providing context to the organization itself,  \\n you are now providing context  \\n to the interaction between these two entities.  \\n Choose the external entity in the interaction  \\n that you want to focus on in the functional flow diagram.  \\n In this case, we will choose the customer making a purchase.  \\n Have a think about all the potential stakeholders  \\n or functional areas within your organization  \\n that are involved throughout the end-to-end process  \\n you are analyzing.  \\n With all of the potential stakeholders listed,  \\n you're now in a great position to work with them  \\n in validating their involvement.  \\n The best way to achieve this  \\n is to run high-level process workshops  \\n with subject matter experts from the areas  \\n that you believe are impacted, especially if you are not.  \\n It's a great to whiteboard each function from end-to-end.  \\n These stakeholders will be able to tell you  \\n if their respective areas are involved or not.  \\n We will now walk through an example  \\n on how to create a functional flow diagram.  \\n Firstly, we start with drawing an oval  \\n and labeling inside the oval with the narrative customer.  \\n The customer initiates a purchase request  \\n against the merchant selling the product.  \\n You will note that we do not map what was purchased,  \\n but only capture that a purchase has been requested.  \\n The merchant then needs to determine  \\n if the customer has authority to make the purchase  \\n by sending a request for approval  \\n to the authorizations department.  \\n The decision on the request for approval  \\n is returned to the merchant  \\n and the merchant sends a charge receipt to the customer.  \\n The authorization department also sends  \\n the purchase information on to the billing department.  \\n The billing department is required  \\n to send a bill to the customer.  \\n The customer makes the purchase payment,  \\n which is the received by the billing department  \\n and a statement is sent to the customer.  \\n The customer happily leave the merchant  \\n with their newly purchased goods.  \\n So the core of creating a functional flow diagram  \\n is, one, draw a circle to represent each functional area.  \\n Secondly, connect the areas with arrows  \\n to illustrate the relationships.  \\n And thirdly, label the arrows  \\n to identify what is exchanged in the two areas.  \\n Remember, at no time does the functional flow diagram  \\n mention anything about how the merchant requests approval  \\n or how the billing department issues a receipt.  \\n These steps are captured in a process flowchart  \\n at a later stage.  \\n Then, lastly, be sure to check back in with the stakeholders  \\n that represented each of the functional area  \\n and validate your functional flow diagram.  \\n They'll be delighted to see  \\n that their area has been captured correctly  \\n and you'll be prepared for more detailed analysis.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2337108\",\"duration\":179,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Pitfalls of functional flow diagrams\",\"fileName\":\"490754_02_04_MM30_issues_2020Q2\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about some of the issues that can surface when creating the functional flow diagram, common mistakes that can be made when developing the diagram, and how you can avoid them.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2729742,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

- I was once a baseball coach with little kids.  \\n At the start of every season,  \\n we'd go through the rules of the game.  \\n Stand here at home plate, hit the ball, and run.  \\n Invariably,

Swimmers, take your mark, get set, go!  \\n Cross-functional flow diagrams  \\n are recognized by their distinctive swim lane appearance.  \\n In fact, they're often referred to as swim lane diagrams.  \\n The swim lane will encompass all activities  \\n that fall to the responsibility  \\n of a particular functional area,  \\n just like a swimming race.  \\n You need to stay in your lane.  \\n All cross-functional flow diagrams are clearly named  \\n at the top of the diagram.  \\n Each actor is assigned their own swim lane  \\n and only those actors that have a part to play  \\n in the process need to be involved  \\n and assigned a swim lane.  \\n You will see in the example, the customer,  \\n merchant and credit card company  \\n are the three actors that will be participating  \\n in this cross-functional flow process.  \\n The great thing about these diagrams  \\n is that at a glance, you can see who is involved  \\n in the end-to-end process.  \\n There are many templates out there  \\n that can be used to create cross-functional flow diagrams  \\n and you'll find that their shapes can vary slightly.  \\n However, the general appearance of the shape  \\n will be the same.  \\n Each shape means something specific,  \\n so it's important that you understand  \\n that each is used for and what they represent.  \\n These shapes are called flow chart symbols.  \\n There are many different flow chart symbols  \\n and each have a specific purpose.  \\n To get started through,  \\n let's take a look at the six most common shapes.  \\n Firstly, there is the circle,  \\n which is the symbol used as the start  \\n and endpoints, also known as a terminator.  \\n The terminator represents  \\n where the process starts and terminates.  \\n Some templates use circles  \\n as connectors or links to other process maps  \\n and add the trigger on top of the circle.  \\n You can use circles or rounded rectangles like this one  \\n on your start or end point  \\n where the trigger is inside the rounded rectangle.  \\n Just make sure you're consistent  \\n so as not to confuse the reader.  \\n The next shape, and the one that's most commonly used  \\n is the rectangle or process box.  \\n I like to use the 90-degree angle boxes,  \\n though you may also encounter round edges.  \\n They both mean the same thing.  \\n The process box is used  \\n to capture each action needed to be performed  \\n and it is mapped out  \\n in the swim lane of the actor responsible  \\n for that activity.  \\n Here the merchant will submit purchase amount.  \\n The credit card company will authorize purchase  \\n and the merchant will complete sale  \\n and so the process goes on.  \\n Where the activities are more detailed,  \\n a separate process workflow or flow chart  \\n may be required.  \\n They can be represented in cross-functional flow diagrams  \\n as a pre-defined process or sub processes.  \\n Type boxes with the distinctive parallel lines.  \\n Some templates with have a small plus symbol as well  \\n and that will indicate they can be expanded on  \\n for more detail.  \\n This is a great feature  \\n as you're able to concentrate  \\n on communicating thoroughly  \\n how actions flow from functional area to functional area  \\n without clouding the document  \\n with lengthy, detailed workflows.  \\n Next up, we have the diamond shape or decision symbol.  \\n This symbol is used to indicate a step  \\n in the process where a decision has to be made.  \\n The outcome of that decision will split the flow  \\n of events into different exit paths from the diamond.  \\n Finally, all of the components are linked together  \\n with arrows or connectors,  \\n indicating the direction and order  \\n that the activities take place.  \\n They essentially connect all of the elements together  \\n and direct the reader through the process.  \\n In cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n the sequencing of steps will flow from the left  \\n to the right, moving up and down  \\n as the activity passes onto the next functional area  \\n so that they can perform their task.  \\n Arrows or connectors are not just used  \\n to show the direction of flow  \\n but can also be used to provide additional key information.  \\n Take the decision process symbol, for instance.  \\n You can see here  \\n that the diamond symbol contains a question.  \\n The direction of flow will be determined  \\n by the answer to that question.  \\n Annotating the connector with a yes  \\n or no allows the flow to respond accordingly  \\n and an alternative path is created.  \\n Now that you know how to create end-to-end processes  \\n using cross-functional flow diagrams,  \\n you'll be well on your way  \\n to winning that next swimming gold medal in no time.

Just like a jigsaw puzzle,  \\n you need all the pieces in a project  \\n to fit together to create the whole picture.  \\n Creating a cross-functional flow diagram  \\n is best achieved after you have validated the pieces  \\n of your functional flow diagram.  \\n We now take the functional flow diagram  \\n and drill down into the next level of detail.  \\n Each functional area and all the entities captured  \\n in your functional flow  \\n will essentially become a swim lane  \\n in your new diagram.  \\n Actors are allocated to each of the lanes down  \\n the left-hand side.  \\n Now you're ready to plot the sequence  \\n of activities across the swim lanes.  \\n In a way, what you are doing  \\n is unraveling the functional flow of diagrams  \\n in a linear process  \\n with a distinct start and end point.  \\n You will tell the story from where it initiates  \\n and then illustrate the flow of events,  \\n in particular how they cross over  \\n between each functional area.  \\n When documenting a business flow,  \\n I like to make the diagram horizontal with the actors  \\n on the left-hand side.  \\n A vertical format is more commonly used  \\n when mapping out technical  \\n or system cross-functional flow diagrams.  \\n However, the principles remain the same.  \\n Each cross-functional flow diagram needs  \\n to start with the process with the trigger event.  \\n A trigger is an event  \\n that has activated the process  \\n to begin on this template,  \\n it's represented by a solid terminated dot.  \\n You can also use circle shapes or rounded rectangles  \\n at the start and end of your diagram.  \\n From the trigger,  \\n we begin mapping out each activity using process box symbols  \\n and then connecting the two activities together  \\n using connecting arrows in the direction  \\n that the workflow needs to take.  \\n When creating a cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n ask yourself: in a perfect world  \\n what functions need to occur  \\n from start to finish to achieve the fastest way  \\n of completing the transaction?  \\n This is referred to as the happy path or main path.  \\n As you work through each step,  \\n clearly label each activity.  \\n As a general rule, each activity should be labeled  \\n with a verb-noun combination,  \\n such as authorize payment.  \\n There shouldn't be more than a few words in each box.  \\n If you find you need a really big box  \\n to explain everything that needs to happen  \\n at this point in the process,  \\n then you may need to consider breaking it  \\n into smaller several steps.  \\n As you map out each activity,  \\n there'll be situations where a decision is required,  \\n altering the flow of the events.  \\n This is where you need to use your decision diamond.  \\n The question is found inside the diamond  \\n and the yes, no path is added showing the flow  \\n with the outcome of the question.  \\n Within every organization,  \\n there's always challenges and unforeseen problems  \\n which occur and prevent a function  \\n from being completed.  \\n These are called alternate flows and exception flows.  \\n An example of an alternate flow  \\n is where a transaction continues  \\n via an alternate path, rejoining the original path  \\n to complete the transaction  \\n after the alternate process is complete.  \\n Exception flows are when a process comes  \\n to a complete stop.  \\n A completely different process or trigger  \\n is required to complete the activity.  \\n This is when you would create another swim lane diagram  \\n to capture the handling of this exception.  \\n Once you have completed your cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n you should have it validated by the actors.  \\n The best way is to organize a series  \\n of walk-throughs with the impacted areas  \\n of the business.  \\n During these sessions, ensure that you have representation  \\n from each area and have them validate  \\n what has been mapped in fact is what they do.  \\n When you are satisfied  \\n that you have conducted thorough validation walk-throughs  \\n and made all necessary changes,  \\n you are ready to expand all of your high-level process steps  \\n into what we call flow charts or process maps.  \\n These are the detailed steps  \\n that each individual actor needs  \\n to know how to complete their part in the

inefficiencies, and complexities.  \\n Because of this,  \\n there is a tendency for business analysts to start here  \\n without truly understanding the full context  \\n of the functions that they're trying to document.  \\n This is an easy trap to fall into.  \\n If you don't do your homework,  \\n you will find yourself chasing your tail,  \\n validating and cross-checking  \\n and, in some cases, having to untangle  \\n and redo hours of work.  \\n Make sure that you always start with a context flow diagram,  \\n even if you think that you know your organization well.  \\n This could save you time and your reputation.  \\n Cross-functional flow diagrams  \\n are also often the main deliverables requested  \\n from key stakeholders and project managers  \\n and who may not necessarily understand the background work  \\n involved in producing an accurate version.  \\n A good business analyst will educate  \\n and involve those stakeholders early on in the process.  \\n This is incredibly useful  \\n when needing to sell ideas or options down the track.  \\n Another question I'm commonly asked  \\n by analysts from all over the world is,  \\n what level of detail do I need to include  \\n in my swim lanes?  \\n This one is a little tricky to answer without context.  \\n However, a general rule of thumb  \\n is to create a subprocess or process flowchart  \\n if you think that a series of steps can be grouped  \\n into a single action.  \\n The last thing you want to do is clutter the diagram.  \\n It's also important not to over-clutter  \\n or confuse your diagram with unnecessary detail.  \\n Your diagram will remain clear and concise  \\n if you simply include a subprocess  \\n rather than providing all the detail at this level.  \\n There's a rule of thumb  \\n that you should not exceed 16 activity boxes  \\n on any one sheet.  \\n White real estate around the shapes in the models  \\n also enables great readability and understanding.  \\n This all comes back  \\n to educating your project team and stakeholders.  \\n If you've been tasked with providing process maps,  \\n ensure that you are all on the same page  \\n and that expectations are aligned.  \\n Take a moment  \\n to walk through the types of business process models  \\n from the context, functional flow,  \\n cross-functional, and detailed flowchart diagrams.  \\n Understand what your end deliverables need to be  \\n and the process to get you there.  \\n This way, you'll have the support  \\n of your project team and stakeholders,  \\n and the process will be more streamlined.  \\n Of course, most importantly, whatever you decide,  \\n the key is be consistent  \\n across all of your cross-functional flow diagrams.  \\n With modern modeling software,  \\n there's an avalanche of available symbols,  \\n graphics, and shapes to select from.  \\n My advice is to limit the options  \\n in what shapes you will use  \\n as the last thing you want to create  \\n in any misinterpretation of what you are trying to share.  \\n As you finalize your cross-functional flow diagrams,  \\n begin socializing them with your stakeholders.  \\n When doing this, there are a few really important things  \\n that you should be aware of.  \\n Firstly, plan for interactions, reworks,  \\n and additional discussions.  \\n Don't expect that you'll have it documented right first off.  \\n A common problem is not allowing enough time  \\n for adequate walkthroughs.  \\n Secondly, understand timings of reviews.  \\n The walkthrough process always takes longer than you expect,  \\n especially if you have a number of stakeholders.  \\n Sending documents out prior to the walkthrough session  \\n and requesting attendees come prepared with questions  \\n can speed this process up.  \\n Next, maintain good version control.  \\n Ensure the models are the most current  \\n as you make any changes  \\n so as to ensure everyone is working off the correct version.  \\n And finally, authority to validate and provide sign off.  \\n It's important that stakeholders  \\n who attend verification meetings have the authority  \\n to validate and provide sign off if necessary.  \\n By following these guidelines  \\n and creating consistency in your modeling practice,  \\n you'll have a library that is valuable for years to come.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

Have you ever bought modular furniture?  \\n You know, the sort that requires you to self-assemble it?  \\n Getting hold of the instructions is essential.  \\n They give you the steps that need to be done  \\n and knowing in which sequence they need to happen.  \\n I've tried to do it on my own a number of times  \\n only to find that I have screws and bits left over.  \\n If I'd used the assembly instructions  \\n and followed the pictures, arrows and sequence,  \\n I'm sure it would have taken less time  \\n and achieved the result that looks  \\n just like the one on the front of the box.  \\n Flowchart diagrams are often referred to  \\n as simply process maps.  \\n Process maps document the flow of activities  \\n performed by a single actor at the lowest level of detail.  \\n Like the cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n these can be documented as existing,  \\n also referred to as current-state or as-is,  \\n or future-state, to-be process maps.  \\n A current-state flowchart process map is extremely useful  \\n in identifying and breaking down  \\n complex business processes.  \\n It also helps you analyze  \\n and identify process inefficiencies.  \\n The KRAC Model is a great tool to use for this process.  \\n When analyzing the current-state processes,  \\n you can look at what steps you need to keep,  \\n remove, maybe add or change to improve  \\n the end-to-end process.  \\n As inefficiencies are found,  \\n it is these changes that will form the beginning  \\n of your proposed new-and-improved, future-state processes.  \\n When you overlay both the current  \\n and future-state process maps together,  \\n the difference that you can find  \\n becomes a set of requirements.  \\n It is these requirements that the business needs  \\n in order to get to their desired future-state.  \\n By identifying what has changed,  \\n you can begin to analyze the impacts  \\n to the existing functional areas.  \\n This is called an impact assessment  \\n and it's extremely useful to help you understand  \\n the transition from the way things are done now  \\n to the way it needs to be.  \\n This old and the new way of doing things  \\n allows you to analyze organizational improvements  \\n and changes, but most importantly,  \\n to manage change across all levels of your organization.  \\n One of the greatest benefits in documenting  \\n flowchart process maps at this level  \\n is that they become the single source of truth  \\n and what needs to be done and in what sequence  \\n an actor needs to perform them.  \\n Process maps support the creation of test scripts  \\n and ensure the process delivers a consistent outcome.  \\n As testing is performed,  \\n errors and updates may impact on your processes.  \\n This feedback loop is vital for ongoing,  \\n continuous improvement activities.  \\n When used in conjunction  \\n with cross-functional flow diagrams,  \\n the flowchart process maps can be used  \\n to create instructional guides and other training materials  \\n like online knowledge center content,  \\n quick reference guides and training manuals.  \\n The analysis that goes into flowcharts  \\n can also help identify the amount of training required  \\n and the number of resources needed for tasks  \\n in the existing or new environment.  \\n The beauty of the detail in your flowchart process map  \\n is that a single activity performed by an individual  \\n or system can be captured in its entirety  \\n from start to end.  \\n A further benefit is its ability to isolate each activity.  \\n An activity can be assessed, refined,  \\n quality controlled, automated and updated  \\n without having to update the cross-functional flow diagram.  \\n Remember the process map is documented  \\n at the lowest level of detail,  \\n which means each step-by-step process will, in turn,  \\n become a step-by-step instruction for the end user  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2330911\",\"duration\":187,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Flowchart diagram features\",\"fileName\":\"490754_04_02_MM30_options_2020Q2\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, explore the features of the flowchart diagram including common symbols and formatting options and the instances where you would apply each of them.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2857480,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

I've referred to the flowchart diagrams,  \\n or process maps, as stepping stones.  \\n To get across a river without getting wet  \\n it's always a good idea to step on the stones  \\n closest to bank and then navigate your way step by step.  \\n So too with the steps to creating a flowchart diagram.  \\n Let's go through the best order  \\n to help you create an accurate and effective diagram.  \\n Before you put pen to paper or the whiteboard,  \\n it's important that you understand  \\n that flowchart process maps should always trace back  \\n to their parent cross-functional flow diagram.  \\n Keeping this connection in mind will help you think about  \\n what you should and shouldn't include  \\n on your flowchart diagram.  \\n Remembering back to our lessons  \\n on cross-functional flow diagrams,  \\n there are times where it's not practical  \\n to include lengthy step-by-step workflow details,  \\n and the number of steps begin to overwhelm the diagram.  \\n I recommend you group these workflows together  \\n in what we call predefined or subprocesses.  \\n It is these subprocesses that are expanded further  \\n and detailed now in your flowchart diagram.  \\n To guide you through the steps,  \\n let's use raise purchase order as an example  \\n of a subprocess that is being mapped  \\n in a cross-functional flow diagram using a subprocess box,  \\n so from this to this.  \\n Firstly, you need to use the round-cornered rectangle  \\n as the symbol used as the start and end points,  \\n also known as a terminator.  \\n In other templates covered in this course,  \\n we've also used circles.  \\n Either is fine as long as you're consistent in your diagrams  \\n and your stakeholders understand  \\n what you mean by your symbols.  \\n Refer back to your cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n which will show you the step just before  \\n the raise purchase order subprocesses was mapped.  \\n This will be the step that triggers this activity.  \\n Let's say that the last step was done by procurement,  \\n and it was for them to send approval.  \\n This means that your trigger to start your flowchart diagram  \\n will be receive approval from procurement.  \\n Second step, which is the actual multiple steps in one,  \\n is to map out each part of the process.  \\n To do this, you use the process box symbol  \\n until the activities workflow is complete.  \\n The trick is never having more than one step in each box.  \\n This is your chance to breakdown the process  \\n into the finest detail.  \\n Another trick to remember is that your flowchart diagram  \\n or process map doesn't need to flow from left to right.  \\n It can flow in a switchback formation  \\n or up and down the page as long as it is logical  \\n and the reader can interpret the flow of the events.  \\n Third step as you map out each activity  \\n is to note where a decision is required.  \\n This will alter the flow of events,  \\n and it is where you need to use your decision diamond.  \\n The diamond symbolizes that the pathways are not broken,  \\n and the normal flow of work can continue.  \\n In the same way the decision diamond is used  \\n in the cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n you need to choose the best way to annotate your response.  \\n Remember to try and be consistent  \\n wherever possible across all your maps.  \\n The fourth and final step is to never assume anything.  \\n Always run workshops.  \\n Talk to the people who are responsible  \\n for the work that you are trying to capture.  \\n Keep your sessions on track  \\n focusing on the normal process first  \\n and then considering the alternate flows.  \\n This will save you a lot of time and effort.  \\n I would also encourage you to ask one of your stakeholders  \\n to step you through the process  \\n and follow it on your flowchart  \\n if they deviate from the sequence you have captured.  \\n This will give you a greater insight  \\n into how different people interpret executing the process  \\n and keeping you all from falling into the murky waters  \\n of inaccurate process and flowchart mapping.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2331554\",\"duration\":203,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Pitfalls of flowchart diagrams\",\"fileName\":\"490754_04_04_MM30_mistakes_2020Q2\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about some of the issues that can surface when creating the flowchart diagram, common mistakes that can be made when developing the diagram, and how you can avoid them.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3090592,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - I like to relate work to life.  \\n It really helps get things sorted in my head.  \\n So when I think of flow chart diagrams  \\n and cross functional flow diagrams,  \\n I think of the challenges that come  \\n with raising my 12 year old twins.  \\n They are a boy and a girl, so they're not identical.  \\n They have similarities that are easy to spot,  \\n but they're also very different.  \\n And they want to be treated differently.  \\n So to with your diagrams.  \\n Drawing the line between cross functional flow diagrams  \\n and process maps, is the first problem I find.  \\n They may seem a little odd  \\n considering that the differences appear pretty clear.  \\n One has multiple actors, and the other a sole actor.  \\n However, you'd be surprised how often analysts  \\n will try to create a hybrid version,  \\n that attempts to encompass multiple players,  \\n in a single flow chart process map.  \\n Another challenge occurs when there hasn't been enough  \\n groundwork done before the flow chart is drawn up.  \\n I have seen occasions where the analyst  \\n jumps straight in trying to map out a flow chart process map  \\n without understanding the context  \\n in which the activity sits.  \\n It's a bit like starting a new job  \\n without knowing where your desk is, the floor you are on,  \\n or even the name of the company you work for.  \\n Without understanding the context  \\n behind the work flow that you want to map,  \\n you will struggle.  \\n This all comes back  \\n to educating your project team and stakeholders  \\n on the standards, guidelines, and principles  \\n to ensure discipline consistency.  \\n If you've been tasked with providing process maps,  \\n ensure that you are all on the same page.  \\n And that expectations are aligned.  \\n I like to include a legend of the symbols used  \\n at the bottom of each model, so there is no confusion.  \\n Take a moment to walk through  \\n the types of business process models,  \\n from the context, functional flow, cross functional flow,  \\n and detailed flow chart process maps.  \\n Understand what your end deliverable needs to be  \\n and the process you need to follow,  \\n in order to get you there.  \\n This way you'll have the support  \\n of your project team and stakeholders,  \\n and you will achieve what you set out to achieve,  \\n at the start of the project.  \\n Assumptions.  \\n Things that we believe to be true,  \\n but are not facts, can get you into a whole world of pain.  \\n The rule I follow is, don't assume anything.  \\n The next challenge is to engage your stakeholders  \\n every step of the way.  \\n Taking them on the journey with you  \\n will help you manage their expectations and create buying.  \\n Giving stakeholders their own sense  \\n of ownership of the processes you are mapping,  \\n will encourage them  \\n because they want to see the results.  \\n Don't be lazy.  \\n Validate your flow charts  \\n by circling back with the stakeholders  \\n and ensure that you have captured your information correctly  \\n and involve the necessary stakeholders.  \\n Remember all flow chart diagrams or process maps,  \\n must trace back to a cross functional flow diagram.  \\n They need to have context.  \\n If they don't belong to a cross functional flow,  \\n then they just simply float, and don't belong anywhere,  \\n and will be impossible to manage.  \\n Just like kids in a family really,  \\n as the parent analyst, all you have to do is make sure  \\n you're consistent, guide them in the same way,  \\n and respect their differences  \\n so that they achieve the outcomes that each is capable of.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"4.

at the highest level,  \\n then work your way down.  \\n Let's recap and see your journey  \\n from the initial context diagram of your organization,  \\n all the way through to the flowchart process maps.  \\n First up, we explored how your organization fits  \\n in the big picture and relates with the outside world.  \\n This is called the context diagram.  \\n Context diagram captures the relationships,  \\n input, and outputs that help your organization  \\n understand what is needed  \\n by these external entity relationships  \\n to deliver products and services to customers.  \\n These diagrams assist in understanding  \\n who and what you do to comply or influence  \\n in achieving the outcomes you're expecting.  \\n Your functional flow diagram  \\n shows a number of functional areas  \\n internal to your organization,  \\n and how they interact with the customer,  \\n being an external entity and each other.  \\n You have far greater influence and possible control  \\n over how your organization performs the required activities.  \\n The cross-functional flow diagram is exactly that,  \\n focusing on how the flow of work  \\n moves across the functional areas of your organization.  \\n This diagram should contain the complete end-to-end process  \\n of a single transaction or interaction  \\n from the initial customer trigger  \\n through to the delivery of a service or product.  \\n These diagrams are immensely valuable  \\n when it comes to seeking how you can sequence  \\n or change the activities  \\n to ensure greater efficacy or required compliance.  \\n You then have the ability  \\n to perform time and motion analysis  \\n to inform better ways of delivering the required outcome.  \\n Though placing too much information  \\n into these diagrams will dilute their value,  \\n imagine how many detailed processes  \\n would need to be captured.  \\n There would be potentially thousands of steps  \\n that need to be completed to cover the end-to-end process.  \\n This is where subprocesses come in.  \\n Through the creation of this diagram,  \\n you'll have identified many subprocesses.  \\n Finally, we take all of the subprocesses  \\n that are in our cross-functional flow diagram  \\n and expand them into the finest level of detail  \\n in what you now know as flowchart process maps.  \\n The more sub processes that you identified  \\n in your cross-functional flow diagram,  \\n the more flowcharts you will need to map.  \\n This is a beautiful way of visualizing  \\n how fundamentally your

now that we know what the four different models are  \\n and how they interrelate,  \\n let's discuss how we put our modeling practice into action  \\n with your stakeholders.  \\n The key to understanding which model you need  \\n to focus on  \\n is in understanding your objective.  \\n Depending on your objectives,  \\n the emphasis or focus on each model will be different.  \\n Essentially, you'll need to use them in some degree  \\n to ensure you have adequate coverage  \\n and don't miss anything.  \\n Ask yourself, what is the area of focus?  \\n What already exists?  \\n Who is the end user?  \\n And how will the information I am capturing be used?  \\n Answering all of these questions  \\n will greatly assist in ensuring that you have  \\n the right stakeholders at the right workshops,  \\n and that you are delivering  \\n the best quality business processes fit for purpose.  \\n Throughout the course  \\n I will have mentioned the use of workshops and walk-throughs  \\n with key stakeholders and subject matter experts.  \\n Let's talk a little about  \\n engaging these subject matter experts  \\n in process elicitation workshops.  \\n Firstly, target your SME audience to meet your needs.  \\n Collaboration with key stakeholders  \\n and subject matter experts is exceptionally important,  \\n ensuring that you set up a workshop environment  \\n that has a clear objective,  \\n and that the right people are present and participating.  \\n The last thing we want to do  \\n is make false assumptions during our modeling.  \\n Let's make use of the whiteboard.  \\n Whiteboards are great  \\n because you can freely outline the context,  \\n and go back and update or build upon them at any point.  \\n In my experience,  \\n I've found making use of colored markers  \\n for distinction between actors  \\n or a change in process flow to be a great help.  \\n The best thing about using a whiteboard  \\n is that at the end of the session  \\n you can take a photo of the information you have captured,  \\n and go back and document it at your leisure.  \\n Another great method is simply using sticky notes.  \\n These sticky notes are particularly good if you're mapping  \\n cross-functional flow or flowchart process maps.  \\n During a workshop situation  \\n you can have your stakeholders participate,  \\n and together map out a process  \\n on a whiteboard, wall, or even a table.  \\n The sticky notes can be easily added, removed,  \\n or moved about as the process is discussed and agreed upon.  \\n The beauty of using sticky notes  \\n is everyone can see, comment,  \\n and get involved in the mapping process.  \\n Again, don't forget to take a photo  \\n so you can document the processes later.  \\n Next, once you have completed your diagram  \\n you are ready to have it validated.  \\n A stakeholder walk-through session is ideal.  \\n In my experience the best way to do this  \\n is to project your models up on a screen  \\n and walk through each step of the process  \\n to ensure that your audience is happy.  \\n And finally, to achieve sign off or approval,  \\n ensure that you have the key stakeholders  \\n who are responsible for sign off  \\n present at your walk-through sessions.  \\n I'd also recommend that you include representation  \\n from the ones who will be using your maps  \\n whether that is for training purposes  \\n or organizational change management needs.  \\n Modeling is an awesome way to leverage the use of visuals.  \\n With these diagrams you can capture, analyze,  \\n and determine future ways  \\n that organizations perform the work required.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Put It All

[Instructor] Have you every wondered how organizations\\nfit together and perform all their functions?\\nAdd on top of that, organizations are needing to change\\nand respond to market and user demands.\\nThese constant changes require the organization to be aware\\nof how they perform their activities\\nand how these activities fit into the bigger picture\\nof achieving their expected outcomes and goals.\\nThis is where Business process modeling comes in.\\nIt's a fantastic visual way to represent how an organization\\ncomes together and performs the work and services needed.\\n\\nEffective process modeling allows us\\ncapturing various levels of detail\\nthrough the benefits of pictures and how the different parts\\nof the organization interact with one another.\\nBusiness process modeling is a technique\\nof capturing the series of processes\\nand how they relate to one another.\\nThe reasons we create process models is to provide\\na visual representation of who does what and in what order.\\nThese models provide us with a better awareness\\nof the end-to-end processes and identify the additional\\ninformation and detail needed to deliver successful change,\\nwith process modeling providing the framework for detailing\\nand documenting important aspects of the organization.\\n\\nThese models enable us to represent the current state,\\nthe way things are done today,\\npotentially define the future state,\\nthe way we want things to be,\\nand recognizing the gaps\\nbetween the two in a consistent format\\nthat can be easily compared and understood by many.\\nThe value Business process modeling represents\\nto the organization is to visually demonstrate\\nthe flow of activities between various stakeholders\\nand the interaction that enables outcomes to be achieved.\\nIn modeling terminology, the stakeholders\\nare referred to as actors.\\n\\nAn actor can be a person, department, system,\\nor an external entity to the organization.\\nThe effectiveness of Business process modeling\\nis to firstly help clarify the steps needed\\nin a particular process.\\nWe then need to add our understanding how\\nthe people, processes, and technologies\\nwithin an organization interact\\nto create the overall system and outcomes.\\nBusiness process modeling is used in understanding\\nthe business operation and, hence,\\nis useful in analysis and design.\\n\\nSo what are the benefits of process modeling?\\nFirstly, it's a great way to ensure that you understand\\nhow the organization runs and performs\\nits business activities right now,\\nand how they touch and relate to the outside world.\\nSecondly, it helps identify areas of the business\\nthat are not well-understood and helps in clarifying\\nresponsibilities across the whole process.\\nThirdly, it helps identity and breaks down\\ncomplex business processes and provides the ability\\nto analyze and identify process inefficiencies.\\n\\nAnd, lastly, these models become artifacts\\nto help you with your training documentation,\\nin understanding and enabling the end-user\\nof what the old and the new way looks like.\\nBusiness process modeling leverages the effective use\\nof visuals and modeling techniques\\nin helping organizations and individuals\\nwork from the 30,000-foot view\\ndown to the level of

Throughout the world, organizations use models\\nand modeling as a cost-effective way\\nto share and demonstrate the concepts and designs\\nto large audiences to receive feedback on what is to

planned\\nas the expected future state.\\nProcess modeling captures the interrelationships\\nbetween the people, processes, activities, and systems\\nin delivering the expected outcome.\\n\\nI want to share with you the four most commonly used\\nbusiness modeling tools at a high-level overview.\\nThe first tool is referred to as the context diagram.\\nThe context diagram provides the high-level framework\\nand interaction of an organization.\\nThe context diagram depicts the organization\\nthat is being analyzed as shown as a circle,\\nthe external entities that connect to the area\\nor system being analyzed represented by boxes,\\nand lastly the relationship of interactions\\nbetween the organization and the external entities.\\n\\nThese are shown as the arrows.\\nThe context diagram is commonly used\\nin understanding and documenting the interrelationship\\nbetween those outside of the organization,\\nnamely the external entities,\\nand the touchpoints into your organization.\\nAs can be seen by the diagram,\\nour focus here are the interrelationships and activities\\nthat are either initiated or needed by the organization.\\nWe now arrive at our next diagram,\\nthe functional flow diagram.\\nThe functional flow diagram is a simple model\\nshowing the functional areas or stakeholders\\ninternally to our organization\\nand how they interact in a logical overall flow of work.\\n\\nThe functional flow diagram always starts\\nwith a stakeholder, usually the customer\\nor another entity external to the organization,\\ninitiating a transaction.\\nStakeholders and internal functional areas\\nare captured in the ovals.\\nThen the appropriate relationships and workflows\\nare drawn between these stakeholder groups.\\nAs we continue our journey down\\ninto the next level of detail,\\nwe start creating cross-functional flow diagrams\\nas a way to capture and sequentially display\\nthe activities that are performed.\\n\\nThe stakeholders are also referred to\\nas actors in the process.\\nRemembering an actor can be a person, system,\\nor functional area.\\nCross-functional flow diagrams are also referred to\\nas activity diagrams and swim lane diagrams.\\nThese diagrams organize activity sequences\\nthat displays the process in the context\\nof the actors responsible for performing the work.\\nThis added structure makes it very easy to read\\nand quickly identifies the individual actor's work\\nas well as cross-functional interactions needed.\\n\\nThese diagrams are very effective in visually sharing\\na process is performed from start to finish\\nand what each and every stakeholder or actor\\nneeds to perform to enable completion of the activity.\\nFinally, we come to the fourth type of modeling\\nknown as process flowcharting.\\nThese traditional process flow models\\nshow the sequential flow of activities,\\ndecision points and other interactions.\\nProcess flow models are used as a way\\nto capture the step-by-step procedures\\nand activities performed by an individual actor.\\n\\nThese process describe who and what has to be involved\\nin fully responding to an event\\nor how people in the enterprise\\ncollaborate to achieve a goal.\\nThese process workflow models are the lower-level detail\\nnot represented in the cross-functional swim lane models.\\nBy visually starting with the big picture,\\nwe cascade into finer detail\\nand create the fourth business process modeling diagrams,\\nthe context diagram, the functional flow diagram,\\nthe cross-functional flow diagram,\\nand the process flow chart.\\n\\nThese four business process models should now form\\nthe basis of your business process modeling toolbox.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:561780\",\"duration\":193,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Modeling consistency and

now?\\\"\\nWhat is it that they want to change, and why?\\nBefore you can answer this seemingly simple question,\\nyou need to ensure you understand the context.\\nThe same is true if you need to analyze a business unit,\\nor an organization.\\nBefore you can delve into the detail\\nof what an organization does,\\nor more importantly, make or suggest changes,\\nyou first need to understand where and how the organization\\nfits into the big picture of things.\\n\\nThe context diagram provides a visual view\\nof how the organization fits within the outside world,\\nand is viewed at the highest level.\\nIn a way, it becomes the checklist for future analysis\\nas each component can be analyzed\\nby drilling down into other detail.\\nThe context diagram is the perfect at-a-glance tool\\nto show where the organization fits\\nin the greater scheme of things.\\nEvery organization interacts with external entities.\\n\\nThese external entities are represented\\nby the boxes in the diagram.\\nThey may include the customer, suppliers, banks,\\ncontractors, and so on.\\nThey're essentially any external entity\\nthe organization shares a relationship with.\\nThese relationships are shown by the interactions coming\\ninto or from the organization.\\nIn the example, we see that the customer places\\na purchase order against the organization.\\nThe organization sends the products and invoice\\nback to the customer,\\nand the customer then makes payment to the organization.\\n\\nThe organization deposits the money into the bank,\\nand so on.\\nA context diagram is a tool that can be used\\nin a number of situations.\\nIt's a great way to understand the relationship\\nthe organization has between the various external entities.\\nThis high level knowledge enables you\\nto identify any significant impacts\\nthat a change to the organization may have\\nin the way they interact with the outside world.\\nBy providing context around how the organization\\ninteracts externally, you can then start to build\\nan understanding of the functions required\\nwithin the organization to support these interactions.\\n\\nAnother great use for a context diagram\\nis when explaining the scope of a project,\\nand how it fits in within the organization.\\nLet's say you're working on a billing system.\\nA system context diagram can communicate\\nto your stakeholders how the new system will interact\\nwith the various internal business units\\nand external business partners, if any.\\nWhen using this tool to communicate to key stakeholders,\\nthey can quickly identify the relationships\\nthat need to change.\\nThese changes become the scope and analysis\\nof what needs to be performed as part of the project.\\n\\nIf you're someone new to the organization,\\ncreating a context diagram is a great way\\nfor you to quickly gain an understanding\\nof the organization and how it interacts.\\nIn fact, it's a great starting point\\nwith any analysis you need to do.\\nContext diagrams are wonderful, visual, modelling techniques\\nthat provide the overall view of the area\\nin which you'll be interacting with,\\nand how it all fits

considers only the inputs or outputs,\\nbut does not review the external entities,\\nprocesses, or systems.\\nContext diagrams also leverage three common components\\nor building blocks.\\nEntities, relationships, and processes.\\nAll of which are needed in creating\\nthat perfect, high level diagram.\\nEntities are the elements or actors\\nthat represent each player\\nthat fits within the context of the diagram.\\n\\nThey can be shown in any way\\nthat provides clarity and helps the reader\\nidentity them easily.\\nIt's not uncommon to see these entities represented\\nand labeled in boxes.\\nWithin those boxes you might find ovals,\\nstick figures, or even graphics or clip art,\\nas long as it fits within\\nthe message you wish to convey.\\nHowever, when creating a context diagram\\nfor the organization you're analyzing,\\nyou would use a circle to represent the main entity\\nand use boxes around the outside\\nto represent the external entities.\\n\\nA circle is used as it indicates\\nwhat you have control of.\\nIn this case, what goes on internal\\nto your organization lives inside the circle,\\nwhereas a box indicates what your organization\\nonly has an influence over.\\nIt's all very well and good\\nto have all the entities identified.\\nWhat really provides the context we are looking for\\nare the relationships between each of them.\\nThis is done with arrows, or flows.\\nThe flows represent the relationship\\nbetween the two entities.\\n\\nThe direction of the flow indicates\\nwhether the interaction is incoming or outgoing.\\nThese flows represent activities\\nthat the analyzing organization must perform\\nand adhere to to ensure smooth interactions\\nthat pass between the two entities.\\nOne entity is sending an activity,\\nalso known as an output\\nand one is receiving the activity\\nand these are called inputs.\\nGood modeling standards dictate\\nthat each relationship starts from one entity\\nand finishes at another.\\n\\nThe customer

further context.\\nAlways remember to keep your context diagram\\nat the highest level.\\n\\nRather than having a flow for each interaction,\\nyou can simplify a diagram\\nby listing all the types in interactions\\non a single flow.\\nThese single flows represent the process.\\nThese processes can each be analyzed separately\\nand drilled down to into more detail\\nwhen you create your functional flow diagram.\\nSo just like framing that perfect photograph,\\nthe best context diagram are simple,\\nclear, uncluttered, and usually fit on one page.\\n\\nBy utilizing the three fundamental

are external to your organization,\\nyou'll place them in a box.\\n\\nEach box will represent a single entity\\nthat interacts with the organization.\\nThroughout the analysis, you will\\nbecome aware of more external entities.\\nThese can be added as you go.\\nRemember, a box is used to represent entities\\nwhere your organization only has influence over.\\nAn example of influence may be\\nthe ability to negotiate an agreement.\\nYou may need them to adapt to your needs.\\nFor instance, having them use\\na template supplied by your organization\\nor complying with secure electronic bank

standards.\\nAs you identify and place\\nthe external entities onto your diagram,\\nbegin to connect the relationships\\nthat occur between each external entity\\nand your organization by drawing one directional arrow\\neither coming or leaving the organization.\\nUsing the right angles for the relationship flows\\nsimplifies the diagram and enables\\ngreater area to label the flows.\\n\\nThen, label the flows with\\nwhat interactions are taking place\\nand whether they're incoming or outgoing.\\nIncoming relationship flows trigger the start\\nof an internal activity within your organization.\\nOnce you have drafted your context diagram,\\nit's essential to validate your analysis.\\nShare the diagrams with others in the organization\\nin seeking their view of who and what is involved.\\nBy keeping them in the loop,\\nyou give them the comfort of knowing\\nthat their processes and relationships\\nare being included for further analysis\\nand insures you don't miss out\\non

required\\ninside your organization,\\nproviding context to the relationship\\nthat you are now analyzing.\\n\\nThink of a bit like a context diagram\\nwithin a context diagram.\\nRather than providing context to the organization itself,\\nyou are now providing context to the interaction\\nbetween these two entities.\\nChoose the external entity and interaction\\nthat you want to focus on in the functional flow diagram.\\nIn this case, we will choose the customer making a purchase.\\nHave a think about all the potential stakeholders\\nof functional areas within your organization,\\ntheir involvement throughout the intimate process\\nyou are analyzing.\\n\\nWith all of the potential stakeholders listed,\\nyou're now in a great position to work with them\\nin validating their involvement.\\nThe best way to achieve this is to run high-level\\nprocess workshops with subject matter experts\\nfrom the areas that you believe are impacted,\\nespecially if you are not.\\nIt's a great way to whiteboard each function\\nfrom end to end.\\nThese stakeholders will be able to tell you\\nif their respective areas are involved or not.\\nWe will now walk through an example of how to create\\na functional flow diagram.\\n\\nFirstly, we start with drawing an oval,\\nand labeling inside the oval with the narrative, customer.\\nThe customer initiates a purchase request\\nagainst the merchant selling the process.\\nYou will note that we do not map what was purchased,\\nthough only capture that a purchase has been requested.\\nThe merchant then needs to determine if the customer\\nhas authority to make the purchase by sending a request\\nfor approval to the authorizations department.\\nThe decisions on the request for approval\\nis returned to the merchant,\\nand the merchant sends a charge receipt to the customer.\\n\\nThe authorization department also sends the purchase\\ninformation onto the billing department.\\nThe billing department is required to send a bill\\nto the customer.\\nThe customer makes the purchase payment\\nwhich was received by the billing department,\\nand a statement is sent to the customer.\\nThe customer happily leaves the merchant\\nwith their newly purchased goods.\\nSo, the core of creating a functional flow diagram is one,\\ndraw a circle to represent each functional area.\\n\\nSecondly, connect the areas with arrows\\nto illustrate their relationships,\\nand thirdly, label the arrows to identify\\nwhat is exchanged in the two areas.\\nRemember, at no time does the functional flow diagram\\nmention anything about how the merchant requests approval,\\nor how the billing department issues a receipt.\\nThese steps are captured in a process flow chart\\nat a later stage.\\nThen lastly, be sure to check back in with the stakeholders\\nthat represented each of the functional areas\\nand validate your functional flow diagram.\\n\\nThey'll be delighted to see that their area\\nhas been captured correctly,\\nand you'll be prepared for more detailed

Swimmers, take your mark, get set, go!\\nCross-functional flow diagrams are recognized\\nby their distinctive swim line appearance.\\nIn fact, they're often referred to as swim line diagrams.\\nThe swim line will encompass all activities\\nthat fall to the responsibility of a particular\\nfunctional area, just like a swimming race.\\nYou need to stay in your lane.\\nStakeholders are found at the start of each lane.\\nThey are referred to as actors.\\n\\nThis is because each actor is playing\\na role in the end to end story.\\nAll cross-functional flow diagrams are clearly\\nnamed at the top of the diagram.\\nEach actor is assigned their own swim lane,\\nand only those actors that have a part to play in the\\nprocess need to be involved, and assigned a swim lane.\\nYou're seeing the example, a customer, merchant,\\nand credit card company are the three actors\\nthat will be participating in this\\ncross-functional flow process.\\n\\nThe great thing about these diagrams, is that at a glance\\nyou can see who is involved in the end to end process.\\nThere are many templates out there that can be\\nused to create cross-functional flow diagrams.\\nYou will find that their shapes can vary slightly.\\nHowever, the general appearance of\\nthe shape will be the same.\\nEach shape means something specific,\\nso it's important that you understand that each is used for,\\nand what they represent.\\nThese shapes are called flow chart symbols.\\n\\nThere are many different flow chart symbols,\\nand each have a specific purpose.\\nTo get started through, let's take a look\\nat the six most common shapes.\\nFirstly, there is the circle, which is the symbol used\\nas the start and end points, also known as, a terminator.\\nThe terminator represents where the\\nprocess starts, and terminates.\\nSome templates use circles as connectors,\\nor links, to other process maps,\\nand add the trigger on top of the circle.\\n\\nYou can use circles, or rounded rectangles,\\nlike this one on your start or end point,\\nwhere the trigger is inside the rounded rectangle.\\nJust make sure you're consistent,\\nso as not to confuse the reader.\\nThe next shape, and the one that's most commonly used,\\nis the rectangle, or process box.\\nI like to use the 90 degree angle boxes.\\nThough, you may also encounter round edges.\\nThey both mean the same thing.\\nThe process boxes used to capture each action needed\\nto be performed, and it is mapped out in the swim lane\\nof the actor responsible for that activity.\\n\\nHere the merchant will submit purchase amount.\\nThe credit card company will authorize purchase.\\nThe merchant will complete sale.\\nSo the process goes on.\\nWhere the activities are more detailed,\\na separate process work flow,\\nor flow chart, may be required.\\nThat can be represented in cross-functional flow diagrams,\\nas a predefined process, or subprocesses\\ntype boxes with a distinctive parallel lines.\\n\\nSome templates will have a small plus symbol as well,\\nand that will indicate they can be\\nexpanded on for more detail.\\nThis is a great feature, as you're able to concentrate\\non communicating thoroughly how actions flow\\nfrom functional area to functional area,\\nwithout clouding the document with\\nlengthy detailed workflows.\\nNext up, we have the diamond shape, or decision symbol.\\nThis symbol is used to indicate a step in the process,\\nwhere a decision has to be made.\\n\\nThe outcome of that decision will split the flow of\\nevents into different exit paths from the diamond.\\nFinally, all of the components are\\nlinked together with arrows or connectors.\\nIndicating the direction, and order,\\nthat the activities take place.\\nThey essentially connect all of the elements together,\\nand direct the reader through the process.\\nIn cross-functional flow diagram,\\nthe sequencing of steps will flow\\nfrom the left to the right.\\nMoving up, and down, as the activity passes\\non to the next functional area,\\nso that they can perform their task.\\n\\nArrows, or connectors, are not just\\nused to show the direction of flow.\\nThey can also be used to provide\\nadditional key information.\\nTake the decision process symbol, for instance.\\nYou can see that the diamond symbol contains a question.\\nThe direction of flow will be determined\\nby the answer to that question.\\nAnnotating the connector with a yes, or no,\\nallows the flow to respond accordingly,\\nand an alternative path is created.\\nNow that you know how to create end to end processes\\nusing cross-functional flow diagrams,\\nyou'll be well on your way to winning\\nthat next swimming gold medal in no time.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:561794\",\"duration\":253,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"How to create a cross-functional flow

format is more commonly used when mapping out\\ntechnical, or a system cross-functional flow diagrams.\\nHowever, the principles remain the same.\\nEach cross-functional flow diagram needs to start\\nthe process with a trigger event.\\nA trigger is an event that has activated\\nthe process to begin.\\nOn this template, it's represented by\\na solid terminated dot.\\n\\nYou can also use circle shapes or rounded rectangles\\nat the start and end of your diagram.\\nFrom the trigger, we begin mapping out each activity using\\nprocess box symbols, and then connecting the two activities\\ntogether using connecting arrows in the direction\\nthat the work flow needs to take.\\nWhen creating a cross-functional flow diagram,\\nask yourself, in a perfect world, what functions\\nneed to occur from start to finish to achieve\\nthe fastest way of completing the transaction.\\n\\nThis is referred to as the happy path, or main path.\\nAs you work through each step, clearly label each activity.\\nAs a general rule, each activity should be labeled\\nwith a verb-noun combination such as authorize payment.\\nThere shouldn't be more than a few words in each box.\\nIf you find you need a really big box to explain everything\\nthat needs to happen at this point in the process,\\nthen you may need to consider breaking it\\ninto smaller, several steps.\\n\\nAs you map out each activity, there will be situations where\\na decision is required, altering the flow of the events.\\nThis is where you need to use your decision diamond.\\nThe question is found inside the diamond,\\nand the yes-no path is added showing the flow\\nwith the outcome of the question.\\nWithin every organization, there are always challenges\\nand unforeseen problems which occur and prevent\\na function from being completed.\\nThese are called alternate flows and exception flows.\\n\\nAn example of an alternate flow is where a transaction\\ncontinues by an alternate path, rejoining the\\noriginal path to complete the transaction\\nafter the alternate process is complete.\\nException flows are when a process comes to a complete stop.\\nA completely different process or trigger\\nis required to complete the activity.\\nThis is when you would create another swim lane diagram\\nto capture the handling of this exception.\\nOnce you have completed your cross-functional flow diagram,\\nyou should have it validated by the actors.\\n\\nThe best way is to organize a series of walkthroughs\\nwith the impacted areas of the business.\\nDuring these sessions, ensure that you have representation\\nfrom each area, and have them validate what has been mapped,\\nin fact, is what they do.\\nWhen you are satisfied that you have conducted\\nthorough validation walkthroughs

we get into how to create flowcharts,\\nlet's take a closer look at the specific features\\nof the flowchart process map.\\nThe main difference that you will immediately see\\nbetween this level of diagram\\nand the cross-functional flow diagram\\nis that there are no swim lanes.\\nThis is because you are only concentrating\\non a single actor.\\nIn other words, there is no interaction\\nwith any other functional area.\\nYou'll also notice that the workflows don't flow\\nfrom left to right necessarily.\\nThey can flow in whichever direction that suits your needs.\\n\\nNormally, the trigger, or starting point,\\nstarts in the top left-hand corner.\\nThey're usually mapped out in a logical way\\nwhere they can easily be followed,\\nand where possible, fitted onto a single page.\\nLike the cross-functional flowchart parent,\\nthe flowchart process maps\\nuse the standard flowchart symbols.\\nThere are many different flowchart symbols,\\nand each has a specific purpose.\\nThe most commonly used are the process box,\\ndecision diamond, and the arrow or connector\\nused to link them all together\\nand show the direction of the workflow.\\n\\nEvery flowchart process map\\nwill have a starting point and an endpoint.\\nThe start, or trigger, can be both a solid circle\\nor a curved-in rectangle and found at\\nthe top left-hand corner of the map.\\nThe flowchart process map then continues to document\\nthe actor's step by step tasks\\nusing process boxes and decision diamonds\\nlinked with connectors until they reach the end\\nand the actor has completed the required tasks.\\nYou'll also notice the use of alternate paths\\ncoming from the diamond decisions,\\nlinking activities back to other process boxes,\\nwhich leads to completing the end-to-end process.\\n\\nIn this example, you will see that there are two endpoints\\nbased on the outcome of those decisions.\\nRemember to always use verb/noun combinations\\nas your descriptors,

I've referred to the flowchart diagrams,\\nor process maps, as stepping stones.\\nTo get across the river, without getting wet,\\nit's always a good idea to step onto the stones\\nclosest to the bank, and, then,\\nnavigate your way, step by step.\\nSo, too, with the steps to creating a flowchart diagram.\\nLet's go through the best order, to help you\\ncreate an accurate, and effective diagram.\\nBefore you put pen to paper, or the whiteboard,\\nit's important that you understand\\nthat flowchart process maps should always trace back,\\nto their parent, cross-functional flow diagram.\\n\\nKeeping this connection in mind,\\nwill help you think about what you should,\\nand shouldn't include, on your flowchart diagram.\\nRemembering back to our lessons on cross-functional\\nflow diagrams, there are times where it's\\nnot practical to include lengthy, step by step\\nworkflow details, and the number of steps\\nbegin to overwhelm the diagram.\\nI recommend you group these workflows together,\\nin what we called pre-defined, or sub-processes.\\nIt is these sub-processes that are expanded further,\\nand detailed, now, in your flowchart diagram.\\n\\nTo guide you through the steps,\\nlet's use raise purchase order,\\nas an example of a sub-process,\\nthat is being mapped in a cross-functional\\nflow diagram, using a sub-process box.\\nSo, from this, to this.\\nFirstly, you need to use the round cornered rectangle\\nas the symbol used as the start, and end points,\\nalso known, as a terminator.\\nIn other templates covered, in this\\ncourse, we've also used circles.\\nEither is fine, as long as you're consistent,\\nin your diagrams, and, your stakeholders\\nunderstand what you mean, by your symbols.\\n\\nIn this box, you note the trigger for the process.\\nTo do this, ask yourself: how do they know\\nthat they have to raise a purchase order?\\nRefer back to your cross-functional flow diagram,\\nwhich will show you the step just before\\nthe raise purchase order sub-processes was mapped.\\nThis will be the step, that triggers this activity.\\nLet's say that the last step was done, by procurement,\\nand, it was for them to send approval.\\nThis means that your trigger, to start\\nyour flowchart diagram, will be\\nreceive approval, from procurement.\\n\\nSecond step, which is the actual, multiple steps,\\nin one, is to map out each part of the process.\\nTo do this, you use the process box symbol,\\nuntil the activities workflow is complete.\\nThe trick is never having more than one step, in each box.\\nThis is your chance, to break down\\nthe process, into the finest detail.\\nAnother trick to remember, is that\\nyour flowchart diagram, or process map,\\ndoesn't need to flow from left to right.\\nIt can flow in a switchback formation,\\nor, up and down the page, as long as it is logical,\\nand the reader can interpret the flow of the events.\\n\\nThird step, as you map out each activity,\\nis to note where a decision is required.\\nThis will alter the flow of events, and,\\nit is where you need to use your decision diamond.\\nThe diamond symbolizes that the pathways are not broken,\\nand the normal flow of work can continue.\\nIn the same way the decision diamond is used,\\nin the cross-functional flow diagram,\\nyou need to choose the best way, to annotate your response.\\nRemember to try and be consistent,\\nwherever possible, across all your maps.\\nThe fourth, and final step, is to never assume anything.\\n\\nAlways run workshops. Talk to the people\\nwho are responsible for the work\\nthat you are trying to capture.\\nKeep your sessions on track, focusing\\non the normal process first, and, then,\\nconsidering the alternate flows.\\nThis will save you a lot of time, and effort.\\nI would also encourage you to ask\\none of your stakeholders, to step you\\nthrough the process, and, follow it,\\non your flowchart, if they deviate\\nfrom the sequence you have captured.\\nThis will give you a greater insight,\\ninto how different people interpret\\nexecuting the process, and, keeping you\\nall from falling into the murky waters\\nof inaccurate process, and flowchart mapping.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:561800\",\"duration\":211,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Understanding the pitfalls of flowchart diagrams\",\"fileName\":\"490754_05_04_MM30_mistakes\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"This video discusses some of the issues that can surface when creating the flowchart diagram, as well as common mistakes that can be made when developing the diagram and how you can avoid them.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3118195,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\"- I like to relate work to life.\\nIt really helps get things sorted in my head.\\nSo when I think of flowchart diagrams\\nand cross-functional flow diagrams,\\nI think of the challenges that come\\nwith raising my 12-year-old twins.\\nThey are a boy and a girl so they're not identical.\\nThey have similarities that are easy to spot,\\nbut there's also very different\\nand they want to be treated differently.\\nSo too with your diagrams.\\nDrawing the line between cross-functional flow diagrams\\nand process maps is the first problem I find.\\n\\nThey may seem a little odd considering\\nthat the differences appear pretty clear.\\nOne has multiple actors and the other a sole actor.\\nHowever, you'd be surprised how often analysts\\nwill try to create a hybrid version\\nthat attempts to encompass multiple players\\nin a single flowchart process map.\\nAnother challenge occurs when there hasn't been\\nenough groundwork done before the flowchart is drawn up.\\nI have seen occasions where the analyst\\njumps straight in trying to map out a flow chart process map\\nwithout understanding the context\\nin which the activity sits.\\n\\nIt's a bit like starting a new job\\nwithout knowing where your desk is, the floor you are on,\\nor even the name of the company you work for.\\nWithout understanding the context behind\\nthe workflow that you want to map, you will struggle.\\nThis all comes back to educating your project team\\nand stakeholders on the standards, guidelines,\\nand principles to ensure discipline consistency.\\nIf you've been tasked with providing process maps,\\nensure that you are all on the same page\\nand that expectations are aligned.\\n\\nI like to include a legend of the symbols used\\nat the bottom of each model so there is no confusion.\\nTake a moment to walk through the types\\nof business process models from the context,\\nfunctional flow, cross-functional flow,\\nand detailed flowchart process maps.\\nUnderstand what your end deliverable needs to be\\nand the process you need to follow\\nin order to get you there.\\nThis way you'll have the support of your project team\\nand stakeholders and you will achieve\\nwhat you set out to achieve at the start of the project.\\n\\nAssumptions,\\nthings that we believe to be true but are not facts,\\ncan get you into a whole world of pain.\\nThe rule I follow is don't assume anything.\\nThe next challenge is to engage your stakeholders\\nevery step of the way.\\nTaking them on the journey with you\\nwill help you manage their expectations and create buying.\\nGiving stakeholders their own sense of ownership\\nof the processes you are mapping\\nwill encourage them to be forthcoming\\nwith information and support\\nbecause they want to see the results.\\n\\nLike slack parents, I see some analysts\\nwho don't put in the work that the process charts demands.\\nDon't be lazy.\\nValidate your flowcharts\\nby circling back with the stakeholders\\nand ensure that you have captured your information correctly\\nand involve the necessary stakeholders.\\nRemember, all flowchart diagrams or process maps\\nmust trace back to a cross-functional flow diagram.\\nThey need to have context.\\nIf they don't belong to a cross-functional flow,\\nthen they just simply float and don't belong anywhere\\nand will be impossible to manage.\\n\\nJust like kids in a family really.\\nAs the parent analyst, all you have to do is make sure\\nyou're consistent, guide them in the same way,\\nand respect their differences\\nso that they achieve the outcomes that each is capable of.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"4.

 \\n - Oh, I'm good.  \\n You know, I could totally relate to that.  \\n Besides the online records project we're working on,  \\n I'm also working on the claims update project.  \\n - Oh yeah, Melissa's been working on that one.  \\n Have you spoken with her?  \\n - You know, I think she's on  \\n my list of folks to connect with,  \\n but I'm sensing a little...  \\n - You know, her area has been impacted,  \\n so she's just so nervous about everything.  \\n - Okay, wow.  \\n You know, thanks for the heads up on that.  \\n It's super helpful context about her current mindset.  \\n - Absolutely, for sure.  \\n - Well, why don't we dig into the medical records  \\n project we're here to talk about.  \\n - Yeah, let's.  \\n - So tell me more about it.  \\n What's the goal of all this?  \\n I want to hear it straight from you.  \\n - Okay.  \\n Well, you know, we're looking to continue  \\n to improve the online medical records for our team  \\n and patients, and we'd like  \\n to see the patients use the self-service more  \\n and this will decrease the volume  \\n in our customer service area.  \\n This is a strategy that we've been doing  \\n and it's a great opportunity for us,  \\n but there have been some areas we're worried about  \\n and we just want to keep the momentum  \\n moving in the right direction.  \\n - Yeah, that makes sense.  \\n Thanks for sharing.  \\n It sounds like you've had some ideas on  \\n how to accomplish some of this.  \\n I'm really hoping that you and I can dig into more  \\n so we can truly accomplish your intended goals.  \\n - Yeah, absolutely.  \\n What do you need to know?  \\n - Well, I really want to understand this  \\n from your perspective and your vision.  \\n It'll really help me connect the other teams  \\n and prepare for upcoming meetings that I'm having.  \\n So why don't we start off with  \\n what does success look like from your perspective,  \\n a patient's perspective  \\n and any other perspective you can share?  \\n - Well, I'm working with Joe in the call center  \\n and he wants to convert the patient's phone inquiries  \\n to online self-service,  \\n as well as leverage AI in that process to help.  \\n Right now, people are calling in  \\n and saying it's a lot easier to call than it is  \\n to get the information online.  \\n And this is just an area of confusion  \\n and obviously a concern for us.  \\n We really need to improve this  \\n and make self-service valuable to the patients.  \\n - Got it, okay.  \\n So patients are trying  \\n to use the online portal and they want to use it,  \\n but it's just too frustrating for them  \\n and they end up calling in instead?  \\n - Exactly, yeah.  \\n - Ah, okay.  \\n All right, well the good news is  \\n that we're here to fix this, right?  \\n - Yeah.  \\n - Well, I think this project started a year  \\n and a half ago with the same mission,  \\n and it seems like the first time we tried  \\n we really missed the mark,  \\n and we only met the technical need in scope,  \\n but we didn't really deliver on the patient behavior  \\n results we were looking for.  \\n What do you see as the biggest risks?  \\n - Well, you know,  \\n for me the biggest risk is that we  \\n continue to frustrate patients.  \\n Right now they're using the site  \\n and I don't want them to give up on us.  \\n - Oh, that's understandable.  \\n So how would you measure success then for this project?  \\n - More of the patients  \\n that are logging in successfully getting what they need.  \\n I want to see the ones that we frustrated in the past  \\n and I want to convert them over to using the online site.  \\n - Right, so it sounds like we really need  \\n to put a high priority on usability  \\n and the patient experience.  \\n - Yes.  \\n - Okay, thanks for that.  \\n I would love to gather some data  \\n that tells us exactly what's happening to users  \\n as they use the online portal.  \\n Things like where they're dropping off in their user  \\n experience and what's likely frustrating them.  \\n I can work with the data analytics team  \\n to research what's happening with the user experience,  \\n and also work with them to predict when a user is likely  \\n to abandon their online experience.  \\n There may also be ways we can predict  \\n and prescribe actions to the user.  \\n If we can model it out with this,  \\n we can look at possible solutions  \\n that will improve all of this.  \\n We can model these solutions and test out some options.  \\n Who on your team would you like us to work with  \\n as we investigate and explore this data  \\n and these various options?

 \\n What research would you do ahead of time  \\n and what questions would you likely start out with  \\n in your plan to talk to them?  \\n I hope you're willing to work through one more example  \\n to fully understand conversation planning.  \\n So here's scenario three:  \\n You've been asked to work on a new project  \\n for the audit operations team.  \\n This team would like to automate some of their work  \\n and need your help in identifying what should be automated  \\n and what some possible solutions are.  \\n Who would you meet with  \\n and what would your objective be for the meeting?  \\n What research would you do ahead of time,  \\n and last, what questions would you likely start out with  \\n in your plan to meet with them?  \\n Okay, do you have your answers ready?  \\n In the next video,  \\n I'll share with you some of my answers  \\n and we can compare.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4520493\",\"duration\":239,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Solution 1: Plan requirements elicitation interviews\",\"fileName\":\"4490066_en_US_03_07_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"TK01. rollbacks noted in storyboard.\\npickup at end of TK01, noted in storyboard.\",\"handoutNotes\":\"Exercise Files > Challenge Scenario Information.pdf\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":true,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":408,\"exerciseFileDisplayText\":\"Exercise Files > Challenge Scenario Information.pdf\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"This video covers planning a successful requirements conversation.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":10736590,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" (upbeat music)  \\n - Before we get to the solution answers, I want you to know  \\n that these answers are just guidelines.  \\n Definitely focus on the concepts, not specific roles,  \\n titles, or perfect answers.  \\n If your answers are different,  \\n just reflect on the differences  \\n as different organizations use different terms  \\n and there's different context.  \\n Okay, let's look at scenario one.  \\n It's about the legacy replacement  \\n of a customer relationship management system  \\n to a package software,  \\n and you've already gotten the project  \\n background from the IT leader.  \\n You can also take a look at the exercise file  \\n for more details to jog your memory.  \\n Now let's answer the challenge questions,  \\n so who would you meet with first?  \\n My answer is the sponsor, and why I chose the sponsor is  \\n because it would be critical  \\n to understand why the sponsor picked this package software  \\n and what he is looking for in a package software.  \\n Understanding the sponsor's goals  \\n and vision is critical to determining how  \\n to approach the users next.  \\n With this info, then I'm ready  \\n to prep and meet with the others.  \\n Next, the meeting objective.  \\n My answer is to understand the goals  \\n and vision of their business operations  \\n with this new software  \\n and the why behind the package software.  \\n And last, what questions would I likely start with?

 \\n Also, what risks do you see are the biggest  \\n risks to this project?  \\n Great, now let's look at scenario two.  \\n It's about the website enhancements  \\n to view medical claim information.  \\n Who would you meet with first?  \\n Well, my answer to this one is  \\n the Director of Customer Service.  \\n I chose them because I'll need to understand the context  \\n of the last six months  \\n and how these two enhancements connect  \\n to the bigger picture, other enhancement requests  \\n and the current issues the customer service team is facing.  \\n This will then help me meet with the others.  \\n My objective is to understand the context  \\n and why these two are the most important  \\n enhancements at this time.  \\n My questions, what pain points are we trying to alleviate  \\n with these two enhancements,  \\n and how will you know  \\n that we've implemented them successfully?  \\n Also, I'd ask,  \\n who will benefit most from these enhancements?  \\n Okay, scenario three, the audit operations project.  \\n I chose the Operations Manager or General Manager.  \\n My objective in meeting with them is  \\n to understand the pain points  \\n and goals of the automation efforts.  \\n The questions that I chose.  \\n What does success look like  \\n and what pain points are we trying to alleviate?  \\n What teams or areas is your team dependent on,  \\n and what teams or areas are dependent on your team?  \\n Also, I'd ask, what parts of your operation are repeatable,  \\n high volume, and maybe good candidates for automation?  \\n One of the biggest mistakes we can make in requirement  \\n solicitation is to dive into the details  \\n before understanding the context and big picture.  \\n When this happens, we often and unknowingly go  \\n after the wrong details.  \\n Remember our online medical record example,  \\n the project has been spending precious time  \\n and money on details that were not creating the  \\n needed business outcomes.  \\n The value of the users converting  \\n to the online system was not originally met.  \\n In all of these examples, we are setting up the context  \\n so when we get to the details,  \\n we're going in the right direction.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4522470\",\"duration\":131,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge 2: Identify what went wrong\",\"fileName\":\"4490066_en_US_03_08_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"There are two files: author and screencap.

You've probably heard about active listening before  \\n and how it's about paraphrasing  \\n what you hear from others in your own words.  \\n But what does this mean to requirement solicitation  \\n and talking with stakeholders?  \\n Well, when eliciting requirements,  \\n it's largely about restating stated requirements  \\n into actual requirements.  \\n A stated requirement is what the stakeholder says they want.  \\n An actual requirement is what the stakeholder actually needs  \\n and is in a language the team can work with.  \\n Plain language without technical terms is best.  \\n It's not always easy to get from one to the other,  \\n but I'd like to share some examples and thoughts  \\n to help evolve your active-listening skills  \\n in the context of requirements.  \\n Just like other areas of life and relationships,  \\n it's important to actively listen  \\n by not just hearing the words,  \\n but listening for the underlying intent.  \\n In requirements,  \\n these underlying intents need to be drawn out  \\n with deep questioning, listening, and probing questions.  \\n Imagine the following scenario.  \\n You're discussing enhancements to a software application  \\n with a stakeholder,  \\n and they say,  \\n \\\"I need a button on the left side of the screen  \\n \\\"that says Submit.\\\"  \\n Now, this is a stated requirement,  \\n but the actual requirement?  \\n Well, that's a mystery at this point.  \\n So I'm going to reply with something like,  \\n \\\"Okay, so let me make sure I understand.  \\n \\\"You need to be able to send the order  \\n \\\"once you've completed  \\n \\\"entering the order pricing information.  \\n \\\"Did I get that right?\\\"  \\n The stakeholder then either agrees  \\n and confirms my paraphrasing into an actual requirement  \\n or corrects my understanding of what the user's trying to do  \\n and provides more information.  \\n So listening for actual requirements that are unstated,  \\n it's difficult,  \\n and this is where active listening comes in.  \\n Active listening is 100% focused on the other person  \\n and what they're trying to communicate  \\n rather than what their exact words are.  \\n Our stakeholders,  \\n they don't understand what good requirements sound like.  \\n We have to reframe what they say  \\n to get to good requirements.  \\n We use active listening and our requirements skills  \\n to do this.  \\n It's listening for the pain  \\n and for what the user is trying to do and solve for  \\n as they talk about the solutions,  \\n and it's listening for  \\n the actions and scenarios users perform  \\n rather than the technical things they say and imagine.  \\n When we're not actively listening,  \\n we're having an internal dialogue  \\n with our own inner voice,  \\n and perhaps we're designing potential solutions  \\n to fix the problem.  \\n Or maybe there's a lot going on in the room  \\n and you're easily distracted.  \\n Or perhaps you're even thinking about  \\n what your next question is  \\n and worried about getting all your questions in  \\n before the time is up.  \\n These are all super normal,  \\n normal types of things and responses when listening.  \\n All of us can easily get caught up  \\n in our own inner dialogue and distractions.  \\n It's important to develop awareness  \\n of when this is happening  \\n so you can slip back  \\n and focus on the other person  \\n and their stated and unstated requirements.  \\n Practicing active listening  \\n and developing self-awareness is a skill  \\n that will enhance your conversation skills greatly.  \\n With analysis and requirements,  \\n this means listening for unstated and actual requirements.  \\n In your next requirements discussion,  \\n practice this unique lens on requirements listening  \\n and see what happens.  \\n I think you'll see great progress  \\n on high quality requirements.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4521483\",\"duration\":192,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Take notes during a requirements elicitation conversation\",\"fileName\":\"4490066_en_US_03_13_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"TK01. rollbacks noted in storyboard\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":410,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"This video explains approaches for taking notes during a requirements elicitation interview or conversation.

 \\n Well, here are some options to consider.  \\n First, old-fashioned note-taking.  \\n This can actually work quite well.  \\n Another option is to use a whiteboard,  \\n where you and the participants can both contribute  \\n to key lists, diagrams, visuals,  \\n action items, and decisions made.  \\n One of my favorite go-to approaches for capturing details  \\n is to prepare for the dialogue with a visual model diagram  \\n or other framework.  \\n So, for example,  \\n if I'm talking to a subject matter expert  \\n on the process that she follows,  \\n I'll create a high-level picture of the process,  \\n and then below it,  \\n I'll create space for each step in the process,  \\n and its people, exceptions, systems, and current issues.  \\n I'll come to the meeting with this framework blank,  \\n or perhaps just the high-level process steps filled in,  \\n and we'll complete the rest as we chat.  \\n I really hope these ideas give you all kinds of reasons  \\n to break out of the traditional note-taking mold  \\n and get better interviewing conversation results.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4522471\",\"duration\":142,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Ending the conversation\",\"fileName\":\"4490066_en_US_03_14_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"TK01. rollbacks noted in storyboard\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":166,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"This video demonstrates how to best wrap up a requirements conversation.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":6770914,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Requirements, conversations that end in a flurry,  \\n they're a risk.  \\n A risk to your reputation  \\n and the project results.  \\n Make sure you have a plan and stick to it.  \\n Plan time appropriately to end the conversation.  \\n To ensure stakeholders are comfortable with our progress,  \\n we need to end the conversation with confidence,  \\n next steps, and appreciation.  \\n Without this, stakeholders leave the room feeling uneasy,  \\n frustrated, and may talk behind your back,  \\n creating unneeded conflict and drama for the project.  \\n I would like to go over some tips on ending the conversation  \\n with comfort and ease.  \\n First, make sure you keep your eye on the clock  \\n and save time at the end of the conversation as well.  \\n I would rather decide with the others  \\n to schedule another block of time than rush  \\n through the agenda, thinking everything got covered.  \\n During the last 10 minutes,  \\n review and summarize what was covered.  \\n You may also want to review the key points, decisions made  \\n and next steps with everyone.  \\n I also like to ask what remains lingering in their minds.  \\n This simple yet powerful technique helps you see  \\n how their mindset has evolved throughout the conversation.  \\n When you are able to evolve the other's mindset,  \\n you're showing your value in the process  \\n As a follow-up to what lingers,  \\n I like to ask, \\\"What concerns  \\n or risk are they thinking about?\\\"  \\n This shows you really care about their concerns  \\n and are not just trying to get through your agenda.  \\n This question also helps provide more context to emphasize  \\n and understand the stakeholder's point of view.  \\n Next, once you understand where their mindset is,  \\n you'll need to quickly determine if more time is needed.  \\n You can ask them if they think more time would be helpful  \\n to explore certain topics.  \\n You can agree on a rough date  \\n and an amount of time needed with them.  \\n Last but not least, review the items to follow up on  \\n with each person, including scheduling any follow up  \\n meetings and when they can expect to hear from you next.  \\n And of course, don't forget to thank them  \\n for their time.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

Sometimes after a requirements conversation,  \\n I can hardly read my own notes.  \\n And yes, I like to take notes by hand.  \\n It's a bit scary when you could barely make out  \\n your own handwriting, but I also realized  \\n that I was so focused on eye contact with the other person  \\n I wasn't paying attention to my own writing.  \\n I would rather have maintained eye contact  \\n and keep the relationship strong than have perfect notes.  \\n Following up on a few things to clarify  \\n isn't always a bad thing either.  \\n It's critical to review your conversation notes  \\n for a few very important reasons.  \\n First, you want to make sure that you understand  \\n the intent of what the person was talking about,  \\n not just the words of the notes that you took.  \\n I like to compare this to the active listening you do  \\n during the conversation and reviewing your notes  \\n with that active listening mindset.  \\n While reading and thinking about your notes,  \\n allow your mind to connect emotionally with the stakeholders  \\n and allow yourself to analyze  \\n in order to develop further questions.  \\n This analysis is critical to identifying requirements gaps  \\n and also a shared understanding.  \\n So many missed requirements could be blamed on the idea  \\n that the stakeholder didn't mention it.  \\n But wait a minute, I want to challenge that and ask,  \\n have we truly analyzed what they've said  \\n and been proactive about thinking about possible gaps?  \\n I'll typically have 15 to 20 or more questions to ask  \\n after one of these conversations,  \\n especially and even after reviewing my notes  \\n and thinking about what needs to be explored further.  \\n Once you've had some time to focus on the notes,  \\n determine a plan to follow up  \\n on further questions and clarifications.  \\n Your plan might be to get more time with them  \\n or send a note with some questions  \\n to clarify things further.  \\n This is your opportunity to analyze, be consultative,  \\n and improve the requirements.  \\n Taking the requirements from stated to actual  \\n with your analysis is worth so much value  \\n in our role comes in.  \\n Some analysts like to just type up the notes  \\n and send 'em off for review,  \\n but I don't recommend this without these analysis pieces  \\n and looking for the intent and missing gaps.  \\n Be strategic about what you send  \\n and the value that you're adding.  \\n Having some follow-up questions keeps the dialogue going  \\n rather than simply just validating what was said.  \\n Another key area is to write up the decisions  \\n that were made.  \\n Also, give them a heads up on the next steps  \\n and when you'll be in touch again.  \\n Remember when sending follow-up emails  \\n that the project is likely not their full-time job,  \\n so emails need to be concise and bulleted  \\n with lots of white space so they're easy to read  \\n and easy to reply and act on.  \\n Rambling emails will often not get replies.  \\n Following up from a requirements conversation is important  \\n and a very strategic part of our work.  \\n Leveraging this step can ensure your relationships  \\n are positive and missed requirements are minimized.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4524439\",\"duration\":139,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Leverage AI in requirements conversations\",\"fileName\":\"4490066_en_US_04_03_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"TK01. rollbacks noted in storyboard\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":221,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"This video goes over how to leverage generative AI to help with requirements conversations.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":6773216,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

 \\n See, sure, you'll have to make the business case  \\n with more details, but even the contextual acknowledgement  \\n that you're not an IT company, you're a customer company.  \\n That's important.  \\n The final part is realizing that data  \\n is just one piece of your puzzle.  \\n When you recommend decisions  \\n or are trying to get people to act,  \\n you always have to step back and consider the full picture.  \\n Just consider the business context.  \\n Simply ask things like, what is the business capable of  \\n or what are their competencies?

 \\n This has the potential where one action  \\n causes the behavior of another action,  \\n and that's where you need to live now with your data  \\n to drive successful decision making,  \\n looking for this causation.  \\n Why?  \\n 'Cause then we can use this knowledge  \\n to now cause our desired outcomes to happen.  \\n Say the team wants more sales,  \\n well what data trends or insights do you have  \\n that shows the actions you took caused an increase in sales?  \\n A promotional event the month prior  \\n could have caused the increase in sales,  \\n so your team thinks it's a good idea  \\n to do another promotional event in the upcoming months.  \\n It's simple logic here  \\n in considering how likely is it  \\n that the action caused the results.  \\n If it's likely, then that gives you insights  \\n on what might work again.  \\n Let's consider HR, the Human Resource department,  \\n they're always looking for ways to hire quality talent,  \\n so they do a job fair.  \\n You ask, \\\"Does a job fair cause talent to become available?\\\"  \\n There might be some correlations here.  \\n But if we took some different actions,  \\n say we reworded the job descriptions, qualifications,  \\n and expectations being advertised.  \\n Can we cause the flow of applicants to change?  \\n Perhaps.  \\n This might have a more direct effect on the desired outcome  \\n of finding quality talent.  \\n But you got to ask that hard question,  \\n \\\"What's going to cause my outcome to happen?\\\"  \\n Avoid the these could happen or has happened,  \\n but get to what will happen.  \\n What in your data can you use  \\n to get the results you want.  \\n Finding those causation results  \\n are what helps you drive the right actions  \\n that deliver your desired outcome.  \\n Like consider this,  \\n mergers and acquisitions are major corporate decisions.  \\n You may not do these every day.  \\n But the same day-to-day cause and effect  \\n you might be making in your work  \\n can be applied here too.  \\n And again, being careful here,  \\n mergers and acquisitions are not caused by something,  \\n they are major strategic decisions.  \\n The action of the merger is how the organization  \\n is hoping to cause the outcome.  \\n And that's what we're doing here.  \\n If we're looking to expand our reach in the global market  \\n or remain competitive in a place  \\n where we are not a leader in technology,  \\n what decision could cause the outcome  \\n of better positioning our organization for success.  \\n Acquiring an organization  \\n that has the technological know-how and capabilities  \\n is the action.  \\n And this action hopefully positions the organization  \\n to achieve it's outcome of greater profits  \\n and expanded markets.  \\n It's just being careful what you're pushing.  \\n You want to use your data  \\n to be the basis of your conclusions.  \\n The trick is to find where there is causation  \\n versus simply correlation in your data  \\n and then you'll have the right data  \\n to base your conclusions on  \\n for a successful data-driven decision.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

 \\n We might need some Training,  \\n so I enter that deliverable and we might want to mark it  \\n that we have an improved website.  \\n So we'll have some marketing done,  \\n and I'll enter Marketing.  \\n I'm now going to copy down the project objective  \\n of website upgrade next to each of these deliverables.  \\n So that each thing we're delivering,  \\n we know why it's needed.  \\n Next, we need our business requirements, those features.  \\n So yep, in the next column,  \\n I'll title it Business requirements.  \\n We want to list now what is required  \\n to achieve those project objectives  \\n and deliver those deliverables.  \\n Start simple and just listen to your stakeholders.  \\n For our Website upgrade,  \\n I hear things like a subscription feature,  \\n so I enter that here.  \\n And they mentioned those pretty interactive images  \\n of site amenities.  \\n So I'll insert another row here  \\n and add Amenities interactive images.  \\n And I'll copy down my deliverable  \\n this requirements trace to along with its trace objective.  \\n Now these are high level what.  \\n So let's start getting into some details of the how.  \\n My how here are simply Solution requirements,  \\n and so I'll enter that here in the next column.  \\n Expand the column to fit.  \\n So then I can start entering in those details  \\n about the requirements.  \\n Like when my stakeholder said  \\n they want a notification of promotions,  \\n I'll enter that here next to Subscription features,  \\n Notification of promotions.  \\n And when talking about the subscriptions,  \\n my stakeholders mentioned the ability to self subscribe.  \\n So since that's tied to the Subscription feature,  \\n I'll add a new line and enter Self-subscribed requirement.  \\n And I'll ensure it's traced to its Subscription feature  \\n in all the corresponding trace deliverables  \\n and project objectives.  \\n Copy it down.  \\n Now Self-subscribed is traced to the business requirement  \\n and all the deliverables and project objectives  \\n that requirement supports.  \\n And now my stakeholders mentioned  \\n a great non-functional requirement  \\n of wanting mobile views or accessible on mobile devices.  \\n So again, this is back to that subscription feature.  \\n So we add another line and copy down  \\n the Subscription feature and all its trace requirements  \\n right from the start.  \\n And then I'll add into the Solution requirements  \\n Available on mobile devices.  \\n Even If you're not sure how these things  \\n might get implemented,  \\n keep listening to your stakeholders.  \\n So I'm going to add in the next column Use case,  \\n and expand it a little bit.  \\n So when I hear stakeholders  \\n talking about being able to subscribe to notifications  \\n when on their smartphone,  \\n that's exactly what I want to capture here.  \\n In the Use case column, for the mobile device requirement,  \\n I enter Subscribe via smartphone,  \\n and expand the column to fit.  \\n This gives some great context to each of our requirements  \\n as we elicit them.  \\n You add in the requirements  \\n at whatever level you identify the math  \\n and then just work to trace them back to objectives,  \\n aligning as needed.  \\n And then now any gaps that remain  \\n is where you know you need to complete your analysis work.  \\n So you work towards your goal of fully trace requirements  \\n in a well laid out, easy to read  \\n requirements traceability matrix.  \\n Then just keep listening for requirements.  \\n If a user states they need to access the website  \\n from a tablet device, then capture that use case.  \\n Just make sure you can trace it to the requirements.  \\n This requirement is Available on mobile devices,  \\n so it's traced to that one,  \\n which is then trace to our prior business requirements  \\n and deliverables and objectives, so I copy those down.  \\n Now, Access via tablet is nicely traced.  \\n And if something wants to throw out,  \\n something that sounds more like a want than a need.  \\n Say IT asks for a test and development site,  \\n go ahead and still enter it as a solutions requirement,  \\n Test and development site,  \\n here are my solution requirements.  \\n And then ask, what requirement does this support?  \\n For example here,  \\n the Landon team might want to add more features  \\n in the future.  \\n So that's the business requirement for this,  \\n Ability to easily add new features in the future.  \\n So I enter in business requirements  \\n Ability to easily add new features.  \\n And then you get your stakeholders to confirm  \\n this is an objective of an Upgraded website.  \\n And so then I can trace this business requirement  \\n to its deliverable and objective.  \\n An Upgraded website is the deliverable that it supports  \\n and website upgrade project objective.  \\n Now, Test and development site is nicely traced.  \\n And we validate this again  \\n by asking the stakeholders for an example of a use case.  \\n They say they want to be able to add new features  \\n to only one section of the website  \\n and not have to redo the whole website.  \\n So I add that in.  \\n Here in the Use case add Able to add a new feature  \\n to only one section of the website.  \\n Now you have a complete picture of not only what's required,  \\n but you also have a valuable tool to help organize  \\n and logically analyze your requirements.  \\n Anything that stakeholders want to see in the project,  \\n you can trace and show the value of each small piece  \\n is adding to the larger overall objectives.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3025079\",\"duration\":371,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Tracing requirements through testing\",\"fileName\":\"3001270_en_US_01_03_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn how to utilize your requirements to facilitate testing and confirmation of the delivered solution.

 \\n Well, what do you test?  \\n So we literally add a column for test case.  \\n I'll expand that out a little bit.  \\n And then I always put a test case  \\n description in the next column,  \\n again, expanding out to fit.  \\n And I'll even wrap the text for easier reading.  \\n This way, now, I start capturing the details  \\n of what we're testing, that we truly delivered  \\n the value adding features.  \\n Say for the smartphone requirement,  \\n I'm going to break up the acceptance criteria  \\n and do small, more manageable tests.  \\n First let's make sure the smartphone can access the website.  \\n So I'll add a test case, access via smartphone,  \\n and I'll put a description in there.  \\n Website is accessible from smartphone  \\n and displays all website features.  \\n So I know now what we'll be testing,  \\n but I'll add another row because there's more  \\n than one test case for requirement,  \\n and that's perfectly normal.  \\n I'll add another row and just ensure  \\n I copied down all the trace requirements.  \\n And so here, I'll add another test case to subscribe  \\n to the sales promotions via smartphone,  \\n and then I'll enter a description  \\n of what I'm testing and validating here.  \\n On a mobile device, we want to be able to select  \\n subscribe to sales promotions,  \\n able to enter our email address and select subscribe,  \\n and then get a confirmation screen that shows to the user.  \\n We're getting a lot of details here,  \\n but the traceability matrix is what helps keep you focused.  \\n If you're editing these items,  \\n we want to trace them all the way through testing.  \\n So now you add in an expected outcomes in the next column.  \\n I'll enter expected outcomes in column M.  \\n Here now in this column is where you can  \\n enter what you expect to happen.  \\n So say for our smartphone test case,  \\n I'll enter of the expected outcome of that on a smartphone,  \\n navigation and menus, subscription features, reservation,  \\n amenity, views, they all display.  \\n And I'll do this now for every single test case,  \\n as this is where you define what is right  \\n or correct functionality that we want our testers to verify.  \\n We then add in the next column, actual outcomes.  \\n I'm going to expand it to fit.  \\n This is where testers can capture  \\n what actually happened when testing.  \\n So that means I'll need another column.  \\n So now I'm going to add in a status column.  \\n Status.  \\n This allows me to track the status of each test case.  \\n As for the results, if the expected outcome  \\n is the exact same as the actual outcome,  \\n then we know the test case has passed.  \\n And so I would simply put the status here as pass.  \\n We'll center for easy reading.  \\n If the expected and actuals, though, do not match,  \\n then the test case is a fail.  \\n And you'd want to now do some  \\n root cause analysis whenever test cases fail.  \\n But the status column is really helpful  \\n to help you manage your entire testing effort,  \\n as you could add in additional statuses,  \\n such as not started and in progress.  \\n And so now you're not just managing requirements,  \\n you're tracking the entire delivery  \\n of those requirements by keeping them traced.  \\n And the coolest thing, if you've tested everything,  \\n and they all pass, then you know  \\n you've delivered all the requirements.  \\n Why?

 \\n It works.  \\n 'Cause next, we want to get visual.  \\n And so, I'll open up a blank page in my modeling software.  \\n I'm using Lucidchart, but anything that can do  \\n visual representations works.  \\n And I'll start with a basic sticky note.  \\n Sticky notes are by far one of the best tools,  \\n whether in-person or digital.  \\n The trick is to write one step per note,  \\n such as first, the customer calls into the call center.  \\n So I'll write, customer calls call center.  \\n And then, the call center greets the customer.  \\n So I'll write, call center greets customer  \\n on a new sticky note.  \\n Next, the call center asks for the customer's name.  \\n And the customer then provides their name.  \\n So then, the call center asks  \\n what the nature of the call is.  \\n So the customer provides explanation for calling.  \\n Call center thanks the customer for calling  \\n and routes the call to the right person  \\n to assist the customer.  \\n That's it, just lay them out.  \\n This creates that really clear picture of  \\n what does and does not happen in the work,  \\n and that's what we want.  \\n Going back to our caller scenario,  \\n the customer says they are unable to login to the website.  \\n So we heard customer, so we label the swim lane.  \\n And now, my first swim lane is labeled Customer.  \\n Then we add the process step for the action  \\n this user is doing, the unable to log into the website.  \\n So I'll add a process box,  \\n unable to log into website.  \\n Next was the call center thanking the customer  \\n for the information and transferring to  \\n the website support team.  \\n So we heard call center now.  \\n So first, let's label the next swim lane.  \\n The next swim lane is labeled Call Center  \\n so we know that role is happening.  \\n We actually heard two process steps in that last comment.  \\n First, they thank the customer for the information.  \\n So I'll add that piece, thank customer for information.  \\n And then they said, transfers to the website support team.  \\n Now here, we have another role.  \\n So let's label that next swim lane as Website Support Team.  \\n Again, do this whenever you hear any role,  \\n just to keep you organized.  \\n So we ask then, what happens next,  \\n and the website support team answers the call  \\n and asks how they can help the customer.  \\n Again, I hear two actions, two activities happening there.  \\n I hear first, they answer the call.  \\n Then, they ask how they can help the customer.  \\n This is great to breakout as you go,  \\n being clear to enter the steps in the swim lane of  \\n who's doing the activity helps keep you really focused,  \\n as now, the customer explains the problem.  \\n So we go back up to Customer  \\n and we explain problem.  \\n Then, when the website support team resolves a problem,  \\n we scroll back down to the website support team swim lane  \\n and we add the process step,  \\n resolves problem.  \\n Notice I just put the steps.  \\n Always do this first.  \\n It keeps things simple.  \\n I'll now review what we've captured with my stakeholders,  \\n as when I do, this is when I'll add in some arrows  \\n to better show the flow of work, like this.  \\n Going back to the first step,  \\n we start with, the customer is unable to  \\n log into the website.  \\n Then, the call center thanks the customer  \\n for the information, so I'll connect these two.  \\n Who then, transfers the customer  \\n to the website support team, so connect that next.  \\n And then, the website support team answers the call,  \\n so draw down to that.  \\n And they ask how they can help, so that's next.  \\n Where the customer then explains their problem,  \\n so back to the customer.  \\n With their website support team then  \\n hopefully resolving the problem.  \\n And so, back down  \\n to the website support team.  \\n Now you can see, we have a complete process flow of  \\n how the work is done and by whom.  \\n I know, probably not that simple in your work,  \\n but the process is exactly the same.  \\n Add your swim lanes, add your process steps,  \\n then connect your process steps as you confirm the workflow.  \\n And then, you'll leave with a clear picture for everyone  \\n of how things work.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3025080\",\"duration\":174,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using process models for process analysis\",\"fileName\":\"3001270_en_US_02_03_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"This video shows you how to identify the different levels of detail of your process models to use with your analysis work.

 \\n And my stakeholders might say an upgrade to website.  \\n So I'll add an element, upgraded website,  \\n or they might mention marketing, so I'll add that in.  \\n And I'll ask who do we have to work with?  \\n And they mention IT, sales team, customer service.  \\n So let's add those in.  \\n IT,  \\n sales team  \\n and customer service.  \\n I'll then ask what other projects  \\n or activities are also going on  \\n or we have to consider.  \\n There's mention of a CRM upgrade  \\n as well as marketing planning for some holiday specials.  \\n So we'll note those here  \\n by adding context of a CRM upgrade  \\n and marketing holiday specials.  \\n Again, I like to have my stakeholders  \\n give me as much information as possible in a live session,  \\n but don't be afraid to continue to add an update.  \\n You may add in anything else you find  \\n during your analysis work  \\n as you can always confirm and validate items  \\n as you continue to review and use your diagram.  \\n Now once you have the items here,  \\n then you think about the relationships.  \\n That's what a line represents  \\n when you do a context diagram.  \\n You can start asking questions like  \\n what is the relationship?  \\n Does one have one of the other?  \\n A one-to-many relationship?  \\n Is there data flowing from one source to another?  \\n Are messages being sent and received between two items?  \\n Does one depend on the other?  \\n Or is one a small component or subset of the larger one?  \\n And if you have this one, must you have the other element?  \\n So going back to our diagram, I look at our central idea,  \\n our website upgrade, and think about how it relates  \\n to each of the elements we added.  \\n So for our website upgrade,  \\n we'll deliver an upgraded website.  \\n I grab an arrow tool and connect website upgrade  \\n to upgraded website and label the relationship as delivers.  \\n And again, for marketing, draw the line,  \\n then label it simply needs marketing.  \\n And I'll continue to ask this relationship question  \\n for each element listed,  \\n connecting each with a simple arrow,  \\n then labeling the relationship.  \\n Again, try to do this with your stakeholders  \\n so they give you the answer.  \\n Why?  \\n Because sometimes we think of something,  \\n but it's not really in scope.  \\n It's good to be aware of, sure,  \\n but just doesn't apply at this point in time,  \\n like the IT is worried about the change  \\n in leadership right now.  \\n So go ahead and add that to the diagram,  \\n change in leadership,  \\n and when I ask how is this connected  \\n to our website upgrade project?  \\n And no one knows.  \\n So then I just leave it.  \\n It's a great way to show items  \\n that could potentially be out of scope,  \\n but lets you acknowledge this stakeholder's input.  \\n Also, because this is an analysis tool,  \\n it's okay if you have some lines missing.  \\n This just means you have to do some more analysis work  \\n to find out how and why,  \\n even if the item is related or included.  \\n And so, the final key is then to use your diagram  \\n throughout your entire change effort.  \\n Don't just create once and toss to the side.  \\n Every time there's a discussion about designs, delivery,  \\n or even simply, should the team do something or not?  \\n Pull out the diagram.  \\n It's a great tangible item to bounce ideas off of,  \\n but then, also consider it a living document.  \\n What I mean is, as your work evolves,  \\n if new information is found out,  \\n then simply add it to your diagram.  \\n If something changes, then change the diagram,  \\n maybe even highlighting the change,  \\n because then, at the end of your effort or project,  \\n you'll have not only a powerful visual of the change,  \\n you'll have a resource that can continue  \\n to be used for future efforts.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3017842\",\"duration\":280,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using a context data flow diagram\",\"fileName\":\"3001270_en_US_03_03_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"This video shows you how to create and utilize a context data flow diagram.

 \\n In this case, there might be a simple confirmation message.  \\n So I draw a line with an arrow going back to the web form,  \\n and then label it as confirmation message.  \\n And so you keep asking what else?  \\n I'll put the CRM system on here since someone mentioned it,  \\n customer relationship management system.  \\n So as a good analyst, then I ask, how is this related?  \\n And my stakeholders may say that the subscription feature  \\n needs to save the customer profile with their email address  \\n in our CRM database.  \\n Okay, two things here, though.  \\n First, save customer profile with email.  \\n So let's add that connection.  \\n Then I heard CRM database, so let's add that here.  \\n 'Cause this is a storage location,  \\n not a function or system like our other circles,  \\n I'm going to use a box and label it CRM database.  \\n This notation is common, you'll see,  \\n when doing data flow diagrams,  \\n but don't worry too much about format right now.  \\n Now I'll add the arrow that the CRM data,  \\n in this case, customer profile and customer email,  \\n are stored in this database.  \\n And then again, think about any data coming back.  \\n We add in that arrow  \\n that the CRM system receives confirmation  \\n of both the stored profile and email address.  \\n Now we are starting to get some great context  \\n and set space for good questions,  \\n as seeing this, my stakeholders then might ask,  \\n what if the customer profile already exists?  \\n Remember, we want both current and future customers.  \\n So we can add in another line to update customer profile.  \\n And then as a customer,  \\n I want to see my profile and just update or confirm it.  \\n So the CRM system would return the current customer profile  \\n to user of this subscription feature.  \\n So draw that in here,  \\n that CRM system returns current customer profile.  \\n Notice there's no order here.  \\n We're solely focused on the data,  \\n knowing what is being sent where.  \\n Helps to get some logical structure for your solutions.  \\n A best practice is to include maybe a process model  \\n to help you articulate when and what is occurring  \\n that creates these data calls and processes.  \\n And so you keep asking what data  \\n the subscription feature needs.  \\n There's talk about showing product information  \\n based on subscription selections, so we add that in.  \\n And when we inquire where this data is,  \\n we learned there's a whole other database  \\n that marketing uses to manage product information.  \\n So we add that in, too.  \\n And now, don't forget about that web form.  \\n Where is that data being entered?  \\n Perhaps an IT person already decided  \\n it's using a Google form,  \\n so we just note that here for now, Google Form.  \\n And I'm using a different shape to help me realize  \\n this is an external item,  \\n what they might call an external entity.  \\n And so this form displays the form fields.  \\n So connect that back.  \\n Now, we've got some great context on what data we need  \\n and where it resides  \\n to start getting a better grasp  \\n on what the subscription feature actually is  \\n and needs to look like that we can continue to work with  \\n as we deliver the final solution.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

Have a central repository to store them.  \\n Once written down in detail to the same level,  \\n represent and agree those  \\n as per the requirements approval process.  \\n Irrespective of whether the requirement  \\n came from meeting minutes or from the top executive,  \\n it should all follow the same process.  \\n You could have all the tools, smart reports,  \\n and top support on the project,  \\n but it's the basic due diligence principle  \\n to document everything thoroughly and regularly.  \\n Number three. Replay requirements back to the requesters  \\n and other stakeholders.  \\n If it's agreed, it's in the can, right? Not always.  \\n Even though you may have received it, documented it,  \\n agreed it with the project team and the stakeholders,  \\n there's still a chance that it's not needed.  \\n Over time and with perspective,  \\n they may come to realize a requirement is not needed.  \\n Also, what I have learned  \\n is that the same business stakeholders and end users  \\n may see the same business need differently.  \\n Include regular review meetings,  \\n review and replay requirements all together  \\n and with the same group of requesters.  \\n Prioritize and reprioritize  \\n until you are certain your list is solid.  \\n Number four. Lock them down.  \\n What I mean by this is once you agree to the requirements,  \\n have a deadline for changes and additions.  \\n Once the deadline is passed, this is it.  \\n No more amendments or improvements or tweaks.  \\n This, of course, is in the purest world  \\n and the real project dynamics may differ.  \\n I get it.

Yes.  \\n The terms are sometimes used interchangeably,  \\n but that's wrong.  \\n They're actually very different,  \\n but they're also linked.  \\n Let me show you.  \\n Let's look at an example  \\n such as delivering any project successfully.  \\n So here are the five typical critical success factors:  \\n Clear project objective,  \\n executive support for the initiative,  \\n stakeholder involvement, project management expertise,  \\n and stakeholder buying.  \\n Once we have the critical success factors,  \\n you use them to define specific KPIs.  \\n These are data points that enable a project  \\n or an organization to decide whether CSFs have been met.  \\n For our project example, this will be things like  \\n the percentage of employees  \\n who clearly get the project objective,  \\n the number of executives supporting the transformation,  \\n the percentage of stakeholders dedicated  \\n to the project initiative,  \\n percentage of employees dedicated  \\n to their initiative with project management skills,  \\n the percentage of stakeholders  \\n who support the transformation.  \\n This type of work is normally driven  \\n by people like the project manager,  \\n senior project team members, and business stakeholders.  \\n But now you know the process and the steps involved,  \\n you can help develop  \\n your project's critical success factors and KPIs.  \\n And why are we doing any of this?  \\n To demonstrate clearly that the business transformation  \\n is delivering value.  \\n So define your CSFs.  \\n Use your KPIs.  \\n You measure that it's working.  \\n You measure that it's progressing.  \\n And you measure that the organization is truly transforming.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4361492\",\"duration\":263,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Balanced business scorecard for performance management\",\"fileName\":\"2453332_en_US_03_02_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about the framework used to craft a balanced business scorecard (BSC) to monitor performance.

When it comes to business transformation,  \\n there is one tool  \\n with unparalleled power,  \\n clearly showing the achievements  \\n as well as the pitfalls.  \\n The balance business scorecard is  \\n a set of performance targets.  \\n It covers four dimensions of performance,  \\n financial, operational,  \\n customer, and innovation.  \\n Now, the idea of the card is  \\n that we need to present measures  \\n to gauge how well we are tracking,  \\n but if we only focus on, let's say,  \\n the operational side,  \\n and we measure turnover,  \\n time, and defects,  \\n we may not understand  \\n the customer's needs and wants.  \\n Equally, if we're focused  \\n on customers only,  \\n the resulting measures may not give us  \\n much in terms of internal capability,  \\n learning and growth.  \\n So income, the balance business scorecard,  \\n you want to create a view  \\n with a balance presentation of financial,  \\n operational, customer,  \\n and innovation measures.  \\n The scorecard is presented  \\n in an easy to read dashboard format.  \\n It enables organizations  \\n to visually draw  \\n and consolidate information  \\n in a single view.  \\n Here I'll go through the basic building blocks  \\n of a balanced business scorecard.  \\n The original balance scorecard  \\n includes four perspectives,  \\n innovation, operational,  \\n customer, and financial.  \\n These can be flexed somewhat,  \\n and I have seen scorecards  \\n from other perspectives,  \\n including risk, for example.  \\n For our purposes,  \\n we'll stick with the original.  \\n Let zoom in on innovation perspective.  \\n You may also see this referenced  \\n as organizational capacity,  \\n also, the Babbel guide calls this  \\n learning and growth.  \\n I tend to gravitate first to this aspect,  \\n as it covers people,  \\n and indicates how good the organization is  \\n at innovation.  \\n It gives us a steer  \\n for the corporate culture,  \\n the employees openness,  \\n and ability to change,  \\n and scores the employees existing training  \\n and capability.  \\n Now, the outcomes of the metrics guide  \\n the organizational investment  \\n when it comes to knowledge up skill.  \\n It also casts a perspective  \\n on the organizational enablers,  \\n such as the infrastructure  \\n and the technology,  \\n with the idea for the employees  \\n to gain further capabilities  \\n and resources that convert their knowledge  \\n into a competitive advantage.  \\n Next area is the operational perspective.  \\n I've seen this referenced  \\n as business processes,  \\n as well as internal processes.  \\n This is where operations are tracked  \\n and analyzed to ensure  \\n the organizational promise  \\n to customers is fulfilled.  \\n These are the metrics  \\n that would also guide things such  \\n as cost saving initiatives.  \\n This is also the area  \\n where you can look at automation  \\n and innovation when it comes to internal processes.  \\n After that,  \\n we have the customer perspective.  \\n The area that speaks directly  \\n to how satisfied the customers are,  \\n with the product or service.  \\n Customer feedback is used  \\n to come up with the measures,  \\n things such as customer satisfaction,  \\n net promoter scores,  \\n customer retention,  \\n and acquisition.  \\n This is important,  \\n as it gives us a view from the outside,  \\n a biased perspective.  \\n And last but not least,  \\n is the financial leg.  \\n Yes, I've called them perspectives still now,  \\n but you can also see them as legs.  \\n Do what works for you.  \\n The financial metrics are  \\n the easiest to come up with,  \\n but be warned,  \\n the fact that you may strive  \\n for increased sales or lower expenses,  \\n does not provide a steer  \\n for how to actually achieve these.  \\n Only once you link the outcome  \\n from the four perspectives,  \\n a balanced picture will start to emerge.  \\n This is definitely an advanced tool  \\n in business analysis,  \\n but don't get overwhelmed,  \\n it's just another tool  \\n that you can master with practice.  \\n The best part is  \\n that the scorecard can be used  \\n to validate the CSFs  \\n and KPIs you developed earlier.  \\n They should all stem  \\n from the organizational mission, vision,  \\n and values for the project.  \\n In the next video,  \\n I'll go through a real life example  \\n and show you how to implement this  \\n on any project.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4361493\",\"duration\":259,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"How to apply a balanced business scorecard to your project\",\"fileName\":\"2453332_en_US_03_03_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to apply the BBS to a real-life scenario.

Next is customer.  \\n The main functions of a new HR tech  \\n are to meet customer needs more effectively  \\n and to increase customer satisfaction.  \\n For the example we're working on,  \\n our customers are our internal employees.  \\n So what should we measure?  \\n Well, it's things like internal employee satisfaction score,  \\n number of employee complaints for HR processes.  \\n At last, the area that I love talking about, innovation,  \\n or learning and growth, the employee's ability  \\n to scale up knowledge and skills.  \\n Part of the project is to teach employees  \\n how to use the new HR system.  \\n So we are measuring things such as  \\n number of Workday tickets logged  \\n and number of closed Workday tickets.  \\n And the good thing, or the tricky thing,  \\n depending on how you look at it,  \\n about HR Tech is that everyone  \\n within the organization is a customer,  \\n including the HR employees themselves, even your CEO.  \\n And you know the saying, the customer's always right.  \\n Well, during elicitation time,  \\n I'm sure all the customers will be  \\n coming up with new perspectives all the time,  \\n especially those vocal or high-level stakeholders.  \\n So while the voice of the customer is important,  \\n this scorecard will help us to view performance  \\n in several areas simultaneously.  \\n That's what makes it balanced, that's what makes it great  \\n and that's what makes it objective  \\n for you and for your stakeholders.  \\n You can use the card as a project initiative gauge,  \\n as a communication tool,  \\n as a performance improvement motivator.  \\n In fact, you can use it  \\n as an underlying conversation starter  \\n in most business contexts because of its wide grasp.  \\n If you're assigned to a business transformation initiative  \\n and there is no mention of this tool, then think again.  \\n Do one of your own.  \\n Show it to the team. Show them the benefits.  \\n Show them that the outcomes are directly correlated  \\n to the promise the business transformation will deliver.  \\n You will gain points not only with stakeholders  \\n but with your own product and delivery teams too,  \\n ensuring a balanced view,  \\n highlighting the most pressing challenges  \\n are front and center.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

Think about how a bicycle or a car evolved over the years.  \\n Both were iterative and incremental  \\n in how they got to their current state.  \\n And both will continue to evolve.  \\n The relationship between elicitation  \\n and analysis is often a little bit of a mystery,  \\n and also involves elements of iterations and increments.  \\n In fact, I see a lot of teams acting  \\n and thinking like it's more of a phase,  \\n thinking that elicitation comes first in a phase  \\n and then analysis.  \\n And this really can't be further from the truth.  \\n What really happens is that we elicit  \\n to have something to analyze.  \\n And we analyze to know what more to elicit  \\n and determine what still needs to be discovered.  \\n This cycle continues until we feel  \\n like we have enough information  \\n to get started in delivering value.  \\n We want to make sure that this cycle of elicit  \\n and analyze is done in a highly collaborative way,  \\n using a variety of techniques  \\n to encourage dialogue, analysis and thinking in others.  \\n Some alone time yourself also helps along the way.  \\n Many teams fall into the trap of reviewing documents  \\n or texts in a tool to get approval  \\n without really doing any real elicitation or analysis.  \\n Text-based requirements reviews  \\n don't encourage the team to truly analyze or innovate.  \\n Text-based documentation can easily nudge the team  \\n into skipping the true essence of elicitation and analysis.  \\n So make sure that in the rush to document and approve,  \\n that elicitation, collaboration and analysis is not missed.  \\n I find that elicitation and analysis often happens  \\n at the same time in the same meeting,  \\n or in the same interaction points,  \\n meaning that some of the techniques we use to elicit  \\n are also used to analyze.  \\n For example, when interviewing a stakeholder,  \\n I ask questions to elicit.  \\n And while listening, I connect some pieces  \\n that cause me to ask more questions.  \\n Asking questions is eliciting,  \\n and connecting the pieces  \\n and discovering more questions is analysis.  \\n So for example, if I ask questions  \\n about a process, and then I do a process model,  \\n I eliciting by asking questions,  \\n and then I'm analyzing by doing the process model.  \\n Through the process model work that I do, I'm analyzing,  \\n and I'm likely going to come up with more questions  \\n to go back and elicit more information.  \\n Then I model and analyze again, and so forth.  \\n This is the iterative nature of elicitation and analysis.  \\n Elicitation and analysis also require planning.  \\n We need to consciously be aware  \\n of the techniques we plan to use and are using.  \\n We also need to adapt quickly  \\n if one of them isn't working.  \\n Great techniques make all the difference.  \\n When you are using the right technique  \\n to elicit and analyze,  \\n your stakeholders are having fun together.  \\n Everyone is learning and evolving their thoughts.  \\n The team is empowered to be innovative  \\n and serve the organization and the customer.  \\n The right techniques to elicit and analyze  \\n bring powerful dialogue to the team,  \\n insightful innovation and less rework overall.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2419079\",\"duration\":185,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Levels of detail in elicitation and analysis\",\"fileName\":\"580635_01_05_MM30_Levels_2021Q1\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, walk through the elicitation and analysis layers and explore how to progressively elaborate by using the concepts of detailed layers to ensure the customer\u2019s needs are met.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2811991,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

 \\n It also helps to look for any tools they are using  \\n outside the product or system,  \\n and to determine if the system is working as expected.  \\n There are basically two types of observation we can do:  \\n passive and active.  \\n When using passive observation,  \\n we don't interact with the user.  \\n We try to understand the process they use,  \\n and their emotions.  \\n We want to learn what is frustrating for them,  \\n and what is delighting them.  \\n And we do this by not talking or interacting with them.  \\n Passive observation is great  \\n in terms of taking less time from the user,  \\n or perhaps they do not even know you're watching.  \\n If they are aware you're watching or observing,  \\n it can make them nervous.  \\n So we have to be careful about that relationship,  \\n and make sure they're not changing their behavior  \\n because someone's watching.  \\n When doing active observation,  \\n we actually are working with the user.  \\n We ask questions during the process  \\n to better understand or confirm what we are seeing.  \\n Active observation takes a lot longer  \\n and interrupts the user.  \\n The results might be more accurate or less accurate  \\n depending on the context and on the person you're observing.  \\n You might get a super user, an average user,  \\n or perhaps a struggling user,  \\n and sometimes it's hard to tell  \\n which group you're observing.  \\n If you think the findings  \\n would vary dramatically based on the user type,  \\n it's a good practice to observe users  \\n at other skill levels as well.  \\n When observing, no matter if it's passive or active,  \\n some of the things you want to look out for are  \\n what feelings does the user have using the system?

Process models are kind of like a good conversation starter.  \\n They're the starting point  \\n of what will hopefully be a meaningful conversation.  \\n Process modeling is about creating a visual  \\n to explain a process or sequence of activities.  \\n It takes a lot of good conversations  \\n to deliver valuable solutions.  \\n That's probably why process modeling  \\n is the most commonly used technique  \\n for requirements analysis.  \\n It's a multi-purpose tool.  \\n You can use process models to ignite dialogue on the team,  \\n see where details fit into the big picture,  \\n visualize the process,  \\n organize requirements information,  \\n and analyze various detailed aspects  \\n of the product, system, or process.  \\n There are various levels of formality in process modeling,  \\n and I typically prefer a more informal style.  \\n I choose a more informal style  \\n because it supports the purpose  \\n of requirements analysis work,  \\n which tends to be more about dialogue,  \\n alignment, shared understanding,  \\n and capturing a memory of a conversation  \\n at many levels of detail.  \\n I find most business requirements work  \\n is more about the conversation,  \\n and to support good conversations,  \\n process models need to be simple.  \\n Stakeholders and the team need to be able  \\n to read and understand the models  \\n intuitively, without a tutorial.  \\n The dialogue when looking at a model  \\n should be about the process,  \\n not about how to read the diagram.  \\n More formal, intricate process models  \\n are great for detailed system analysis,  \\n or trying to have a machine read the process model.  \\n Here are my favorite go-to principles  \\n when using process models.  \\n First, know what you are modeling.  \\n Are you modeling the current state or future state?  \\n Typically, we're defining the future state  \\n with requirements,  \\n and only looking back when needed  \\n to reuse some of the current state.  \\n Be careful not to focus too much on the current state.  \\n We're designing the future, not the past.  \\n Next, the best process models  \\n progressively elaborate and are built in layers.  \\n Try not to put all the detail into a single model.  \\n Start high-level,  \\n and progress to the details layer by layer.  \\n Make it action-oriented and be specific.  \\n Name the process and its activities  \\n in a verb plus noun format.  \\n Avoid using ambiguous words like manage,  \\n process,  \\n handle,  \\n and coordinate.  \\n These words are so easy to get a group to agree on,  \\n but they build false consensus  \\n and cause more problems later.  \\n They are untestable, and they force developers  \\n to interpret or guess what's really needed or meant.  \\n I've attached an exercise file  \\n of words to avoid and words to use in your models.  \\n Now, let's look at an example.  \\n In this process flow for payment checkout,  \\n you see the verb plus noun format  \\n for every step in the process.  \\n The verbs used, select, enter, and confirm,  \\n are all actionable verbs  \\n that are testable and easily understood by developers.  \\n You may be wondering, what about all the details?  \\n If process models are supposed to stay simple,  \\n then where are the details  \\n like decisions, exceptions, and alternative paths tracked?  \\n We could model them all out, but that might get complicated.  \\n So instead, I prefer to use a decision table  \\n for each step in the process  \\n to show the logic within each step.  \\n I also like to align and attach other details,  \\n like scenarios and user interface mock-ups,  \\n to each step of the process flow.  \\n Using simple process models  \\n with details provided as supplements to each step  \\n helps teams collaborate more effectively.  \\n It keeps the information organized in buckets  \\n that are consumable and ready for conversation.  \\n Process models are great tools for requirements.  \\n When done right, they inspire great conversation, analysis,  \\n and prevent gaps.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2418087\",\"duration\":277,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Context diagrams\",\"fileName\":\"580635_03_03_MM30_Context_2021Q1\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about the requirements technique, context, and scope diagrams and why they are beneficial to teams.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":4172033,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - I talk a lot about the importance of techniques  \\n that get everyone on the same page.  \\n It's what I call shared understanding.  \\n To build shared understanding  \\n you can't dive into the details on day one.  \\n You need to start with the big picture. You need context.  \\n Context diagrams are one of my favorite analysis techniques.  \\n They show the solutions big picture  \\n by providing a view of a system or product  \\n in its environment including the people  \\n and systems it interacts with.  \\n A context diagram helps teams identify scenarios,  \\n users, user goals, and external systems.  \\n It provides an overall outside-in perspective.  \\n I love working with context diagrams  \\n because it helps the team stay out of the details  \\n until we truly know and understand the big picture.  \\n So let's take a look at our online coffee store case study  \\n and build a context diagram together.  \\n We have included an exercise file that provides a summary  \\n of this case study.  \\n So where do we start?  \\n The center of a context diagram represents the product name,  \\n solution or domain.  \\n In this case, our domain is online ordering.  \\n From there you want to add the key people  \\n or roles that interact with the online order.  \\n Of course you're including your primary customer,  \\n but then add other internal and external roles,  \\n like the manager, warehouse worker and shipper.  \\n It's also important to include key internal  \\n and external systems that support online ordering.  \\n This is a big part of the big picture  \\n that helps the team get an understanding of a system's scope  \\n and complexity and can identify missing stakeholders.  \\n In this case we would use rectangles  \\n to identify our payment processors  \\n like PayPal and the credit cards  \\n and also show a box for internal data stores.  \\n Notice we don't call out every data store individually.  \\n That's too much detail,  \\n but we did call out PayPal separate from credit cards.  \\n Can you guess why that might be important?  \\n Perhaps it's a new payment option  \\n our organization hasn't used before  \\n or we already know it requires  \\n a significantly different interface than our credit cards.  \\n Next, we explore the interactions between our entities  \\n and our goal using directional arrows.  \\n Each arrow and phrase represents the intentions  \\n of that user role or system with the solution.  \\n For example, our customer intends to browse items,  \\n place items in a cart and check out items.  \\n In return our solution needs to receive the order  \\n and send status notifications to the user.  \\n Our warehouse workers need to view the orders  \\n and update orders.  \\n Our credit card partners need to receive payment data  \\n and return payment confirmation data and so on,  \\n until all the primary interactions  \\n between entities are diagrammed.  \\n This context diagram is a great representation  \\n of the intended scope at a summary level  \\n that can be used throughout the project.  \\n A few tips when working with context diagrams.  \\n First, do not connect the user roles to each other  \\n or the rectangle entities.  \\n Though this may feel natural to do so,  \\n it implies sequence and this model is about interaction  \\n and data, not sequence.  \\n Next, try to keep it to about 15 total arrows.  \\n It will be tempting to get much more detailed,  \\n but worth it to keep it at a higher level  \\n to maintain readability.  \\n Other models will cover the details better.  \\n This model is about context and the big picture.  \\n Last, try not to make this a technical architecture diagram  \\n of the technical components.  \\n This is a context model to help with user and business  \\n point of view.  \\n When done right, leaders and QA teams, especially,  \\n love this diagram.  \\n It's a visual that everyone  \\n can quickly get on the same page with.  \\n The dialogue it creates with the team is

And the why or benefit is so that I don't have  \\n to reenter information.  \\n This story needs more details that come out in conversation  \\n and that conversation needs to be captured.  \\n We use acceptance criteria to show the details  \\n of what success looks like in this story  \\n from a user point of view.  \\n Acceptance criteria for this user story is  \\n how the online shopper would describe  \\n this story as working.  \\n For example, some acceptance criteria would look like this.  \\n When I enter a credit card number that does not match  \\n the type, I should be notified and be able  \\n to reenter to correct the issue.  \\n I also should be able to simply select the expiration date  \\n on a visual calendar, rather than type in a date.  \\n Our goal is to make each user story  \\n a discrete piece of user functionality.  \\n However, as the project evolves, it's quite common  \\n to discover user stories that are too big  \\n because they include multiple pieces of functionality  \\n that need to be discussed, analyzed,  \\n and prioritized, separately.  \\n In that case, we need to apply a story splitting technique.  \\n When splitting a story, we will keep it  \\n from a user point of view and avoid splitting  \\n by technical component or a team activity.  \\n For example, some ways to split  \\n our credit card story would be  \\n as an online shopper, I want to select the type  \\n of credit card I am using so that I can make sure  \\n my entry is accurate for the card type.  \\n As an online shopper, I want to enter the  \\n credit card number so that I can have it  \\n saved for future use.  \\n And, as an online shopper, I want to enter  \\n my expiration date so I can get my credit card validated  \\n as a form of payment.  \\n Splitting stories like this is important to breaking  \\n down the story into smaller pieces for deep dialog,  \\n analysis, and prioritizing what's important.  \\n As user stories are created and split  \\n a story map is a great way to analyze how  \\n all of the stories fit together.  \\n Organizing user stories in a visual format helps  \\n the entire team see the forest through the trees.  \\n A story map tells the whole story versus a small part of it.  \\n It's a technique that keeps the team focused  \\n on the user experience and results  \\n in better dialog and conversation.  \\n To create a user story map, we take all the user stories  \\n and place them in sequence of how a customer  \\n uses the product from left to right.  \\n The vertical columns of a story map provide the details  \\n under the higher level story or theme.  \\n For our online coffee store, user stories  \\n about browsing and searching would be on the left  \\n followed by selecting items, managing the cart, checkout,  \\n and on the far right, stories related  \\n to viewing shipping status or viewing previous orders.  \\n The stories listed vertically are detailed out such that  \\n the top line are buckets of stories or a theme  \\n and the detailed stories come below.  \\n Story mapping is a great way to discover gaps  \\n in requirements and analyze flow, data,  \\n and the user journey.  \\n User stories and story maps are  \\n great analysis techniques for all projects.  \\n I encourage you to continue to learn more  \\n about how to use this great

- We ask systems to make thousands of decisions every day.  \\n Getting the decision logic correct  \\n in our requirements is no easy task.  \\n Decision tables are a great way to organize  \\n and display decision logic,  \\n and I use them frequently for requirements analysis.  \\n Let's take a look at our online coffee store case study  \\n and use a payment example,  \\n and start thinking about which parts  \\n of the online payment process has decision logic.  \\n Things like if-then conditions, for example.  \\n One area that jumps out at me is shipping costs.  \\n Most companies have several different conditions  \\n that must be met to determine  \\n the appropriate shipping costs for an order.  \\n They might offer free shipping for preferred customers,  \\n discounted shipping for large orders  \\n or additional fees for next day shipping.  \\n These conditions, especially when combined  \\n generate dozens of decision paths  \\n that will make visual models  \\n sprawl across multiple pages, making it very hard  \\n for your stakeholders to understand and evaluate.  \\n In many cases, decisions are better modeled  \\n in a decision table.  \\n Let's start with a shipping calculation example.  \\n Here are the requirements written in a text format.  \\n To build a decision table,  \\n we start with defining the results  \\n or the decision to be made in the last column.  \\n In this case, the decision  \\n is not clear from the text requirement.  \\n However, when we ask ourselves  \\n what decision this logic supports,  \\n it becomes more obvious that the decision  \\n is to determine what costs  \\n the customer will pay for shipping.  \\n When considering this example,  \\n we need to analyze the text for the decisions and scenarios.  \\n So next we analyze the text-based rules for the conditions  \\n that contribute to making the decision  \\n and add them as column headers on the table.  \\n In this case, we would end up with conditions such as,  \\n are they a preferred customer?  \\n Is the order over $50?  \\n Is it standard versus rush shipping?  \\n Ideally, we want the conditions to be binary,  \\n a yes/no condition.  \\n And the ideal table has between two and four conditions.  \\n With these boundaries, the table stays small and manageable.  \\n If you have more conditions,  \\n consider putting together multiple tables  \\n that build into one.  \\n So now that we have the result and the conditions,  \\n we need to determine how many possible scenarios there are.  \\n When the conditions are a yes or no  \\n this calculation is easy.  \\n It's an exponent calculation.  \\n So for this one, three conditions  \\n with two options each  \\n is two raised to the third power or two cubed.  \\n With this math our decision table  \\n will have eight rows or eight scenarios.  \\n And this shows the importance of using  \\n binary yes/no conditions and keeping conditions limited.  \\n If not limited, the table gets very large  \\n and hard to review and analyze.  \\n Okay, so now we have the results,  \\n the conditions and the total number of scenarios.  \\n Next, we extrapolate out the eight scenarios  \\n into the various combinations.  \\n Now we are ready to determine the decisions  \\n of this logic and confirm them as a team.  \\n And this means completing the results column of the table.  \\n I like having the table prepared to this point  \\n and then reviewing with key stakeholders to gain consensus  \\n on the result column values.  \\n Keeping it collaborative like this gets others involved.  \\n Make sure to provide the framework of the table  \\n like the conditions and results,  \\n and a few example rows completed to get the group going.  \\n Using a decision table helps us pause to identify  \\n all of the scenarios and puts the logic  \\n into an easy to read, discuss, and review format.  \\n Developers and testers also love having this guide  \\n to make sure they're developing  \\n and testing the right scenarios and have clear results too.  \\n Decision tables also help keep our process models simple.  \\n They can provide the details of a step in the process  \\n and help minimize all of the decision diamonds.  \\n I find decision tables very helpful in my requirements work.  \\n They're a great technique for generating meaningful dialogue  \\n about decisions and logic.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2414134\",\"duration\":237,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Data flow

- Have you ever had to enter your address three times  \\n when buying something online?  \\n You enter your address on a screen  \\n when you create your profile,  \\n or start a purchase,  \\n so, why doesn't it show up later in the process  \\n for shipping, billing, confirmation page,  \\n and receipt, right?  \\n In requirements, we refer to this as data flow.  \\n Our stakeholders and users often assume  \\n that data flows to the various processes,  \\n and don't explicitly ask for this flow  \\n when they talk about their requirements.  \\n Data flow analysis is a critical tool  \\n for generating high quality requirements.  \\n Without data flow analysis, customer satisfaction drops  \\n and defects rise.  \\n Users get frustrated when they don't see the data  \\n they expect and are asked to reenter data  \\n they've already provided.  \\n Defects also increase when the data needed  \\n for automated decisions is not where it needs to be.  \\n A data flow diagram provides a great visual  \\n of the processes and the data that flows through them.  \\n It provides a big picture  \\n for the team to discuss and understand their data needs.  \\n This is a view that other models just don't show well.  \\n Let's look at our online payments example,  \\n and think about the primary processes our customers  \\n and systems need to complete.  \\n We'll keep these pretty high level  \\n and place them in circles in the center of the page.  \\n For example, the customer needs to tell us  \\n how they want to pay, select payment type.  \\n They need to enter their payment information,  \\n enter payment details,  \\n and tell us how and where they want it shipped,  \\n select shipping options.  \\n The system needs to validate the payment,  \\n calculate the shipping costs, and confirm the order.  \\n Then, we need to identify the data stores  \\n that hold the data needed to support the processes.  \\n We add those data stores  \\n to the bottom of the diagram, like this.  \\n Now, the most important and valuable part  \\n of the data flow diagram, the arrows.  \\n We look at each circle or process  \\n and determine what chunks of data need to flow to  \\n and from the process to the customer and the data stores.  \\n Let's look at the process to select payment type.  \\n What data does the customer need to provide  \\n to complete this process?  \\n The customer needs to select the payment type  \\n and that payment type needs to be stored  \\n in the customer payment information database.  \\n Why does the data need to be stored?  \\n Well, because the system will need to support the process  \\n to validate and authorize the payment.  \\n Let's fill in a few more arrows.  \\n When we get to the confirm order,  \\n we realize we need to get  \\n our customer order database involved.  \\n Our customer indicates they are ready to confirm the order.  \\n The order details are placed in the customer order database  \\n and the system sends the order summary to the customer.  \\n So, we're at the point where our data flow diagram  \\n includes everything we know.  \\n Is it complete?  \\n Well, probably not.  \\n A critical step in any diagramming process  \\n is collaborating with others  \\n and walking the diagram together.  \\n Facilitate the walkthrough  \\n by asking them questions like,  \\n where do we store the

- What is the status of my order?  \\n Status, or the state of something, is often a key part  \\n of the logic within many systems and processes.  \\n If status and timing are critical components of a solution,  \\n then state and sequence diagrams will boost the value  \\n of your requirements.  \\n Let's start with state diagrams.  \\n State diagrams show the different states  \\n something can take on.  \\n For example, your order online is in the cart,  \\n purchased, processing, shipped, or received.  \\n A state diagram shows all these states  \\n and what causes the state to change.  \\n Without understanding the states and how they change,  \\n your user experience will be compromised.  \\n Let's look at an example.  \\n This state diagram shows the various order statuses  \\n and what moves the order between the various states.  \\n This is critical in helping developers  \\n make sure that these events, data, and states happen  \\n in concert with the user actions and data flow.  \\n You can also create a state table to show the same analysis.  \\n It's a different visual to show the same thing,  \\n and it would look like this.  \\n Next, let's look at sequence diagrams.  \\n Sequence diagrams show the interaction between people  \\n and different parts of a system.  \\n It shows the messages that get sent  \\n between the parties over time.  \\n Sequence diagrams help teams build a shared understanding  \\n of how various messages flow between people and systems,  \\n and when responses are expected.  \\n This is important so that the team can see and discuss  \\n the interactions expected between various users and systems,  \\n and when they work alone and together.  \\n Let's look at an example.  \\n In this example, we can see where the user interacts  \\n with a user interface, and where the user interface  \\n takes the information further for processing  \\n that does not involve the user.  \\n Sequence diagrams can be at the business level  \\n or at a very technical level showing system level messages.  \\n Be sure to model what's needed for your intended audience.  \\n Sequence and state diagrams are a great part  \\n of a requirements analysis toolkit, and great for details  \\n that tend to get lost in translation with other models.  \\n We've stated the business level with these examples.  \\n and they can get very

 \\n Well, it can be if you know how to adapt your project  \\n and requirements approach.  \\n Many teams customize the package software more  \\n than what's truly beneficial.  \\n The users and organization need to adapt  \\n to the software process,  \\n rather than customize whenever possible.  \\n This will save the organization lots of pain and money  \\n in the future.  \\n When buying software, whether it's a package, cloud based,  \\n or any other pre-built solution,  \\n there are some key differences to consider  \\n when working with requirements.  \\n First, keep your requirements focused on the user  \\n and the activities they need to accomplish with the system.  \\n It doesn't serve the project to define technical  \\n and functional details  \\n of exactly how the user will perform the task,  \\n as the software is already built,  \\n and changing at that level is typically cost prohibitive.  \\n Even technical processes that use pre-built software  \\n need to be looked at from how it impacts the user.  \\n What's important is making sure  \\n that the software allows the users to perform  \\n their necessary activities.  \\n It's best from a cost perspective for the users to adapt  \\n to how the package has them perform the activity,  \\n rather than customizing it to how the user wants it to work.  \\n If the software purchased is altered  \\n and customized beyond configuration,  \\n the risk is it becomes more cost-effective  \\n to build it yourself.  \\n Many organizations that need customizations build  \\n extension services, rather than alter the code  \\n of the purchase software.  \\n Next, make sure to understand the business rules, logic,  \\n policies, and decisions  \\n you're looking for the system to perform.  \\n Then, make sure that the system allows you to configure  \\n and perform these rules with the needed data inputs.  \\n This is typically in the configuration part of a system  \\n where you're allowed to configure the inner rules  \\n of each step a user performs for an activity.  \\n Then consider how the purchase software defines  \\n and connects data.  \\n Prebuilt software has predefined data definitions,  \\n assumptions, and relationships, and in many cases,  \\n these differ from the buyer's data definitions,  \\n assumptions, and relationships.  \\n It's important to identify  \\n and understand these differences before implementation.  \\n This usually comes out when reports don't seem right,  \\n and later in the research,  \\n we find that the data means  \\n something different than we thought,  \\n and last, integrations.  \\n Integrations are critical to most purchase software,  \\n as organizations want systems to exchange data  \\n to and from the purchase software.  \\n It's important to define the business purpose  \\n of each integration,  \\n the process its supports, and the user impact  \\n with and without the integration.  \\n Once these are known,  \\n we have enough context to work on the details.  \\n The details typically include defining the data needed  \\n between the systems and the detailed data attributes.  \\n Take a look at the exercise file I've created  \\n for you to find more considerations for integrations.  \\n For many organizations, the balance is tipping  \\n towards buying software,  \\n rather than building it from the ground up.  \\n It can be a great cost saver if done right.  \\n Doing it right relies  \\n on the team's ability to help users adapt their needs  \\n and activities to a different look, feel,  \\n and sometimes a different process.  \\n Make sure your users, rules,  \\n data and integration needs are thought through,  \\n and you will likely see the promise realized  \\n of purchase software.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"4.

We ask Systems to make thousands of decisions every day.\\nGetting the decision logic correct in our requirements\\nis no easy task.\\nDecision Tables are a great way to organize\\nand display decision logic,\\nand I use them frequently for requirements analysis.\\nLet's take a look at our online coffee store case study\\nand use a payment example, and start thinking about\\nwhich parts of the online payment process\\nhas decision logic, things like if-then conditions\\nfor example.\\n\\nOne area that jumps out at me is shipping costs.\\nMost companies have several different conditions\\nthat must be met to determine the appropriate shipping costs\\nfor an order.\\nThey might offer free shipping for preferred customers,\\ndiscounted shipping for large orders,\\nor additional fees for next day shipping.\\nThese conditions, especially when combined,\\ngenerate dozens of decision paths\\nthat will make visual models sprawl across multiple pages,\\nmaking it very hard for your stakeholders to understand\\nand evaluate.\\n\\nIn many cases, decisions are better modeled\\nin a decision table.\\nLet's start with a shipping calculation example.\\nHere are the requirements written in a text format.\\nTo build a decision table, we start with defining the result\\nor the decision to be made, in the last column.\\nIn this case, the decision is not clear\\nfrom the text requirement, however, when we ask ourselves\\nwhat decision this logic supports, it becomes more obvious\\nthat the decision is to determine what costs\\nthe customer will pay for shipping.\\n\\nWhen considering this example, we need to analyze the text\\nfor the decisions and scenarios.\\nSo next, we analyze the text based rules\\nfor the conditions that contribute to making the decision\\nand add them as column headers on the table.\\nIn this case, we would end up with conditions such as,\\nare they a preferred customer, is the order over $50,\\nis it standard versus rush shipping?\\nIdeally, we want the conditions to be binary,\\na Yes/No condition, and the ideal table has between two\\nand four conditions.\\n\\nWith these boundaries, the table stays small and manageable.\\nIf you have more conditions, consider putting together\\nmultiple tables that build into one.\\nSo, now that we have the result and the conditions,\\nwe need to determine how many possible scenarios there are.\\nWhen the conditions are a yes or no,\\nthis calculation is easy.\\nIt's an exponent calculation.\\nSo for this one, three conditions with two options each,\\nis two raised to the third power or two cubed.\\n\\nWith this math, our decision table will have eight rows\\nor eight scenarios, and this shows the importance\\nof using binary Yes/No conditions\\nand keeping conditions limited.\\nIf not limited, the table gets very large\\nand hard to review and analyze.\\nOkay, so now we have the results, the conditions,\\nand the total number of scenarios.\\nNext, we extrapolate out the eight scenarios\\ninto the various combinations.\\n\\nNow we are ready to determine the decisions of this logic\\nand confirm them as a team, and this means completing\\nthe results column of the table.\\nI like having the table prepared to this point\\nand than reviewing with key stakeholders\\nto gain consensus on the results column values.\\nKeeping it collaborative like this, gets others involved.\\nMake sure to provide the framework of the table,\\nlike the conditions and results, and a few example rows\\ncompleted to get the group going.\\n\\nUsing a decision table helps us pause\\nto identify all of the scenarios,\\nand puts the logic into an easy to read,\\ndiscuss and review format.\\nDevelopers and testers also love having this guide,\\nto make sure their developing and testing\\nthe right scenarios and have clear results too.\\nDecision tables also help keep our process model simple.\\nThey can provide the details of a

Buying software is so much easier than building it, right?\\nWell, it can be if you know how to adapt\\nyour project and requirements approach.\\nMany teams customize the packaged software\\nmore than

the four things to consider\\nwhen working on requirements for buying\\nor implementing a package software.\\nKeep user goals front and center.\\nBusiness rules and logic,\\ndata definitions, and integrations.\\nLet's go through each of these in more detail.\\nFirst, keep your requirements focused\\non the user and the activities they need\\nto accomplish with the system.\\nIt doesn't serve the project to define\\ntechnical and functional details\\nof exactly how the user will perform the task,\\nas the software is already built,\\nand changing at that level is typically cost prohibitive.\\n\\nEven technical processes that use prebuilt software\\nneed to be looked at from how it impacts the user.\\nWhat's important is making sure that the software\\nallows the users to perform their necessary activities.\\nIt's best from a cost perspective\\nfor the users to adapt to how the package\\nhas them perform the activity\\nrather than customizing it to how the user\\nwants it to work.\\nIf the software purchased is altered\\nand customized beyond configuration,\\nthe risk is it becomes more cost effective\\nto build it yourself.\\n\\nMany organizations that need customizations\\nbuild extension services rather than\\nalter the code of the purchased software.\\nNext, make sure to understand the business rules,\\nlogic, policies, and decisions you're looking\\nfor the system to perform.\\nThen, make sure that the system allows you\\nto configure and perform these rules\\nwith the needed data inputs.\\nThis is typically in the configuration part of a system\\nwhere you're allowed to configure the inner rules\\nof each step a user performs for an activity.\\n\\nThen, consider how the purchased software\\ndefines and connects data.\\nPrebuilt software has predefined data definitions,\\nassumptions, and relationships.\\nAnd in many cases, these differ from\\nthe buyer's data definitions,\\nassumptions, and relationships.\\nIt's important to identify and understand\\nthese differences before implementation.\\nThis usually comes out when reports don't seem right,\\nand later in the research we find\\nthat the data means something different than we thought.\\n\\nAnd last, integrations.\\nIntegrations are critical to most purchased software\\nas organizations want systems to exchange data\\nto and from the purchased software.\\nIt's important to define the business purpose\\nof each integration, the process it supports,\\nand the user impact with and without the integration.\\nOnce these are known, we have enough context\\nto work on the details.\\nThe details typically include\\ndefining the data needed between the systems\\nand the detailed data attributes.\\n\\nTake a look at the Exercise File I've created for you\\nto find more considerations for integrations.\\nFor many organizations, the balance is tipping\\ntowards buying software rather than building it\\nfrom the ground up.\\nIt can be a great cost saver if done right.\\nDoing it right relies on the team's ability\\nto help users adapt their needs and activities\\nto a different look, feel,\\nand sometimes a different process.\\nMake sure your users, rules, data,\\nand integration needs are thought through,\\nand you will likely see the promise realized\\nof purchased software.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"4.

map,\\nsometimes called a flowchart or a value stream map,\\nsimply shows all the steps in the process,\\nincluding how it starts and ends, actions taken,\\nand the decision points along the way to the output.\\nThere are a lot of great courses on LinkedIn Learning\\nfor how to build these models.\\nMake sure to check them out.\\nA list of recommended courses\\nis included in your course handouts\\nthat you can use to get more comfortable\\nbefore diving into the analysis portion,\\n'cause having a good process model\\nis where we can dive into the analysis fun.\\n\\nSo with our process model out,\\nyou first want to always check that your process model\\nfollows a few good conventions,\\nas this will make it easier to analyze.\\nOn your process model,\\ncheck that each process step has a verb to denote action.\\nSo going to our example,\\nInventory Management and Manufacturing Phase\\nare two steps in this process.\\nWe want clarification on for what is actually happening,\\nlike I might change Inventory Management\\nto Update Inventory Management System.\\n\\nRewording each step\\ncan help you catch inconsistencies and redundancies.\\nLike Manufacturing Phase is just a statement,\\nwhereas the actual manufacturing, the action verb,\\nis in Convert raw materials into products.\\nInstead of showing these phases as a process step,\\ntry some color coding\\nso that it is clear on the action steps.\\nThen I'll color code yellow\\nthe steps in the Manufacturing Phase,\\nand then I'll remove the actual Manufacturing Phase.\\n\\nThen I'll do the same with the Distribution Phase.\\nI'll color code the distribution steps with green\\nand remove that square\\nthat just labels the Distribution Phase.\\nNow let's look at the decisions.\\nWe want the steps real clear on the decisions\\nas these are important.\\nYou want to beware of decision diamonds.\\nYes, these are meant to help show there are options,\\nbut there are two things happening\\nas we look at our decision listed of Quality control check.\\n\\nWhen we see this diamond,\\nthere's actually an action step before the decision,\\nand then the diamond is simply a direction diamond.\\nSo let's change this to be more appropriate\\nso that there is a process step to check the quality.\\nThen we adjust the diamond\\nto simply a yes-or-no question of,\\ndid the product pass quality control?\\nAnd then when we show the options now,\\nhaving that extra step\\nis easier to show how defective products\\ngo back to the start of the manufacturing process again.\\n\\nIn my app I'm using now,\\neven color coded the yes with a green arrow\\nand the no as a red arrow.\\nNow those lines are even more clear\\nwhat is or is not happening.\\nAnd so with just a few simple steps\\nthat are great process mapping considerations\\nfor any supply chain analysis,\\nwe literally have a clearer picture\\nof what is happening with our process.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:6026503\",\"duration\":163,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Collaborate with

management.\\nAnd a good habit to start out every process analysis session\\nis to simply walk through the process\\nand identify those boundary areas.\\n\\nThink of boundaries where we transition\\nfrom one department or system,\\nlike we started with our good questions\\nand we immediately ask about who is receiving components\\nin the step receive components.\\nThis is a great place for a swim lane\\nwhen you have different people or departments\\ndoing different things.\\nSo I'll add the swim lanes.\\nAnd we'll label the first swim lane sourcing department,\\nand then the next swim lane, receiving department,\\nand then production.\\n\\nAnd then I'll move the process steps\\ninto their respective swim lane.\\nAnd with just this quick shift in view,\\nwe see that there is now a visible boundary\\nfrom sourcing to receiving.\\nAnd now this view even more easily highlights\\nthat there's some inconsistencies\\nin that only some suppliers send advanced shipping notices.\\nAs you clarify process models,\\nthis is where it can be a good thing to simply annotate\\nthat there is potential for issues.\\n\\nFor example, receiving struggles\\nand knowing if the shipment is complete\\nor more components are coming,\\nit may delay indicating in their ERP system,\\nthe enterprise resource planning system,\\nthat the materials have been received.\\nA virtual sticky note to call out this boundary\\ncan be all that is needed to instantly improve\\nand help the process\\nby identifying why this boundary is important,\\nsuch as I'll simply label this notifications from suppliers\\nso we know that this is a potential area to examine further.\\n\\nMoving on to the production steps,\\nthis is where we can see\\nanother type of boundary to call out.\\nThe steps show that the product\\nhas three stages to completion,\\nyet the entry of the status into the ERP system\\nis not done until the entire product is completed.\\nThis is a great thing to notice.\\nWhen and where are you using systems in your processes?\\nAnd I say systems, mostly towards IT,\\nbut can be any business rule or governance as well.\\nSeeing that production produces products in batches\\nand waits to update the ERP system\\nuntil the entire product is done could be an issue.\\n\\nLet's add some more notes to the process\\nwhere these boundaries could be impacting our supply chain.\\nI'd put one right here where it says update ERP,\\nand I'll note that it's batch entry into ERP\\nas this is a potential risk to our process flow.\\nBut then I'll also add some more sticky notes\\nfor each step in the production process\\nto evaluate the pros and cons of updating the ERP\\nafter each step.\\n\\nThen I'll add in the other swim lanes\\nfor a process model to finish the walkthrough.\\nNow the walkthroughs are so valuable as in fulfillment,\\nI'll ask where the order is marked as fulfilled.\\nAsking this shows us that there's another boundary\\nas they do it in the ERP system,\\nso let's update this to mark order as fulfilled in ERP.\\n\\nSo then we notice the order is fulfilled\\nbefore the product is gathered.\\nThis could result in rework\\nif for some reason the products were not available\\nor accurately tracked.\\nSo again, another boundary sticky note\\non the timing of the fulfillment entry into the ERP system.\\nFinishing up, we have opportunities here with logistics.\\nAs there is no validation step during the handoff,\\na quick note to ask about\\nwhat if there are any issues with logistics\\nis a good note to ask about the feedback loops\\nfor when processes do not function as planned.\\n\\nAnd that is the same thing as we see\\nwith the handoff to the customer.\\nWhat if there's an issue\\nand the customer needs to return an item\\nor report a broken product?\\nThat this means the product goes from the customer\\nback to the company,\\nbut not just where,\\nbut who would they go back to?\\nSo I'll add the same sticky note\\nthat what if there is an issue with the product\\nwhen it gets to the customer?\\nAnd so another label on the boundary\\nthat has the potential to impact our process model.\\n\\nAnd stepping back even further,\\nwith this great visual,\\nwe can see all the handoffs that occur,\\nall the places where the process crosses a boundary\\nin visual terms,\\nwhere there is a process line crossing a swim lane line.\\nThese are the places where there is the potential\\nfor negative impacts on our processes.\\nAnd with this insight on the boundaries,\\nyou can now have meaningful

actually solving.\\nI like to just put a sticky note\\non the process models up top so that I can stay focused.\\n\\nIn this scenario, there are complaints\\nabout deliveries being delayed\\nand there are increasing unhappy customers\\nand they're seeing increasing customer refund request.\\nNow you want to ask if each of these are causes or effects.\\nYou want to troubleshoot the causes\\nso that you address the effects.\\nThe customer deliveries delayed\\nis the problem we want to address,\\nsince that could be actually causing the other two effects.\\n\\nSo I'm going to just bold the customer's deliveries delayed\\nso that we're clearly focused in on our work now.\\nNow we're going to use the process model\\nand watch this cool trick to help us get focused.\\nTake your focal problem\\nand ask each step if it could be causing our issue.\\nLike would a customer placing an order\\nresult in customer deliveries delayed?\\nProbably not 'cause this process step\\nreally starts us going.\\n\\nThen could the order being sent\\nto the warehouse result in delays?\\nPossibly, so go ahead and leave it there.\\nThen ask if the process of warehouse picking\\nand packing the order could result in delays?\\nYep, that's a probability, so leave it here\\nand then order shipping might be a delay as well.\\nBut then we decide the last two steps\\nprobably aren't causing our delays and we move on.\\nNow coming back to the possibilities,\\norders sent to warehouse, we ask for clarity\\nand we find out that this is just a system step\\nthat happens the moment the customer submits their order,\\nit shows up in the warehouse's queue\\nand the enterprise resource planning tool, the ERP system.\\n\\nSo with that being automated, we'll eliminate this\\nas being a focal cause point.\\nIn the order shipped step,\\nwe find out that this process step really includes,\\nreceiving the item from the warehouse,\\nscanning it into the ERP system,\\nselecting the right shipping method,\\nand having the item picked up by the carrier.\\nNow with more detail on our process step,\\nthis is a great point to get some data on your process.\\nYou might ask when does the carrier pick up\\nand how are the shipping times?\\nAnd asking good questions,\\nyou find out that the pickups normally happen the same day\\nand the company only uses two to three day shipping.\\n\\nSo with these noted on the subprocesses,\\nwe can remove the relationship of our issue\\nback to order shipped as a possible root cause.\\nSo let's focus in now on the warehouse picking\\nand packing the

team says, it definitely takes longer than planned.\\n\\nSo let's note that with a sticky note\\nthat orders are delayed in getting to shipping.\\nSo let's use the five why's to break down this issue.\\nSimply ask, why are orders getting delayed to shipping?\\nThe team says, picking\\nand packing takes longer than expected.\\nOkay, why is picking\\nand packing taking longer than expected?\\nWell, items are often hard to find in the warehouse.\\nGreat, we're getting somewhere.\\n\\nSo why are they hard to find?\\nWell, inventory is not organized by high demand items.\\nAnd one more final why question gives us\\nthat inventory management policies\\ndo not prioritize reorganization based on sales trends.\\nNow this policy issue is the root cause of our focal problem\\nof customer deliveries delayed.\\nAnd by getting down to the root cause of the right problem,\\nyou can help those resulting symptoms disappear\\nwith some great process analysis

[Instructor] SIPOC is simply Suppliers, Inputs,\\nProcess, Outputs, and Customers.\\nAnd while simple,\\nit can be a great way to look at your process\\nfrom a different angle to see great opportunities.\\nLet's start with a basic process model\\nthat is in your exercise handouts.\\nIt is the basic steps of a process\\nfor a restaurant serving food\\nbut includes the steps of acquiring the raw materials\\nand the transportation to the restaurant,\\njust like a simple supply chain model.\\n\\nNow, let simply layer a SIPOC table\\nbeneath our process flow map.\\nI'm just using the vertical swim lanes for ease of use.\\nNow, the important part is to ask the good questions,\\nbut we're going to focus using this SIPOC model,\\nand I like to start with the Process section.\\nAnd the question to start is simply,\\nwhat are the steps of the process from procurement\\nto customer delivery?\\nAnd keep this simple to start.\\n\\nYou want enough information\\nto just start thinking through the process,\\nlike Record Inventory,\\nStock Shelves,\\nMeal Planning,\\nMenu Prep,\\nFood Prep,\\nOrders Received,\\nFood Cooked,\\nFood Served.\\n\\nGreat, with your process generally described,\\nknow that you can always come back to define the steps\\nif you need more detail.\\nFor now, let's use it and move to Outputs.\\nThis is looking at your process model and answering,\\nwhat are the final products or services delivered?\\nLooking at your process steps,\\nwhat is produced?\\nAnd here's where you can see if you need more detail\\nin your process steps or if it's good enough.\\nLike what is the output of Record Inventory?\\nWell, that would be an Updated Inventory.\\n\\nAnd Stocked Shelves would lead to Stocked Shelves.\\nAgain, keep it simple\\nand think about what is the output\\nof each of your process steps,\\njust to give you the details in a structured approach.\\nNow that you're thinking about\\nwhat each part of your process produces,\\nthink about what you need to produce that product.\\nThese are your Inputs.\\nWhat resources, materials, information,\\nor people are required for each step of your process.\\n\\nAnd again, keep it simple.\\nThink about what or who you need to record inventory.\\nLike we literally need some inventory,\\nand then we need an inventory management system.\\nBut this is what helps us answer the next question.\\nWho are the suppliers?\\nFor Suppliers, we want to focus in\\non who provides the raw materials,\\nthe goods, the services.\\n\\nIn this example, inventory comes from local farms\\nand ABC Manufacturing.\\nThen let's finally move over to Customers.\\nWith all this hard work,\\nwho are the recipients of the outputs\\nand how do they interact with the outputs?\\nAnd here's where you can see the power of this process.\\nSure, we'll add in dining customers consume the food,\\nthe end of the process in general.\\n\\nBut now let's look at the Outputs,\\nlike updated inventory.\\nWho uses the updated inventory?\\nIn this case, the kitchen manager uses the updated inventory\\nto identify the next inventory order.\\nNow, this causes you to ask questions\\nabout certain thresholds,\\nor how do they know if there's a need for more inventory?\\nAnd so in the inputs you add in inventory management levels.\\nAnd adding another input means you need to ask\\nwhere this input comes from,\\nwhat is supplying this input?\\nAnd this is done by the kitchen team\\nat monthly review sessions.\\n\\nAnd you simply continue to use each item from the process\\nto help walk through each of the other areas,\\nfrom Outputs and Customers to Inputs and Suppliers,\\nanalyzing and getting more detail on the process.\\nAnd this gives you a great view of your process\\nto then ask questions about:\\nWhere the bottlenecks?\\nAre there any redundancies?\\nWhat is missing?\\nAnd where are things inefficient?\\nBy just simply turning the view on your process\\nby

 \\n We might need some Training,  \\n so I enter that deliverable and we might want to mark it  \\n that we have an improved website.  \\n So we'll have some marketing done,  \\n and I'll enter Marketing.  \\n I'm now going to copy down the project objective  \\n of website upgrade next to each of these deliverables.  \\n So that each thing we're delivering,  \\n we know why it's needed.  \\n Next, we need our business requirements, those features.  \\n So yep, in the next column,  \\n I'll title it Business requirements.  \\n We want to list now what is required  \\n to achieve those project objectives  \\n and deliver those deliverables.  \\n Start simple and just listen to your stakeholders.  \\n For our Website upgrade,  \\n I hear things like a subscription feature,  \\n so I enter that here.  \\n And they mentioned those pretty interactive images  \\n of site amenities.  \\n So I'll insert another row here  \\n and add Amenities interactive images.  \\n And I'll copy down my deliverable  \\n this requirements trace to along with its trace objective.  \\n Now these are high level what.  \\n So let's start getting into some details of the how.  \\n My how here are simply Solution requirements,  \\n and so I'll enter that here in the next column.  \\n Expand the column to fit.  \\n So then I can start entering in those details  \\n about the requirements.  \\n Like when my stakeholder said  \\n they want a notification of promotions,  \\n I'll enter that here next to Subscription features,  \\n Notification of promotions.  \\n And when talking about the subscriptions,  \\n my stakeholders mentioned the ability to self subscribe.  \\n So since that's tied to the Subscription feature,  \\n I'll add a new line and enter Self-subscribed requirement.  \\n And I'll ensure it's traced to its Subscription feature  \\n in all the corresponding trace deliverables  \\n and project objectives.  \\n Copy it down.  \\n Now Self-subscribed is traced to the business requirement  \\n and all the deliverables and project objectives  \\n that requirement supports.  \\n And now my stakeholders mentioned  \\n a great non-functional requirement  \\n of wanting mobile views or accessible on mobile devices.  \\n So again, this is back to that subscription feature.  \\n So we add another line and copy down  \\n the Subscription feature and all its trace requirements  \\n right from the start.  \\n And then I'll add into the Solution requirements  \\n Available on mobile devices.  \\n Even If you're not sure how these things  \\n might get implemented,  \\n keep listening to your stakeholders.  \\n So I'm going to add in the next column Use case,  \\n and expand it a little bit.  \\n So when I hear stakeholders  \\n talking about being able to subscribe to notifications  \\n when on their smartphone,  \\n that's exactly what I want to capture here.  \\n In the Use case column, for the mobile device requirement,  \\n I enter Subscribe via smartphone,  \\n and expand the column to fit.  \\n This gives some great context to each of our requirements  \\n as we elicit them.  \\n You add in the requirements  \\n at whatever level you identify the math  \\n and then just work to trace them back to objectives,  \\n aligning as needed.  \\n And then now any gaps that remain  \\n is where you know you need to complete your analysis work.  \\n So you work towards your goal of fully trace requirements  \\n in a well laid out, easy to read  \\n requirements traceability matrix.  \\n Then just keep listening for requirements.  \\n If a user states they need to access the website  \\n from a tablet device, then capture that use case.  \\n Just make sure you can trace it to the requirements.  \\n This requirement is Available on mobile devices,  \\n so it's traced to that one,  \\n which is then trace to our prior business requirements  \\n and deliverables and objectives, so I copy those down.  \\n Now, Access via tablet is nicely traced.  \\n And if something wants to throw out,  \\n something that sounds more like a want than a need.  \\n Say IT asks for a test and development site,  \\n go ahead and still enter it as a solutions requirement,  \\n Test and development site,  \\n here are my solution requirements.  \\n And then ask, what requirement does this support?  \\n For example here,  \\n the Landon team might want to add more features  \\n in the future.  \\n So that's the business requirement for this,  \\n Ability to easily add new features in the future.  \\n So I enter in business requirements  \\n Ability to easily add new features.  \\n And then you get your stakeholders to confirm  \\n this is an objective of an Upgraded website.  \\n And so then I can trace this business requirement  \\n to its deliverable and objective.  \\n An Upgraded website is the deliverable that it supports  \\n and website upgrade project objective.  \\n Now, Test and development site is nicely traced.  \\n And we validate this again  \\n by asking the stakeholders for an example of a use case.  \\n They say they want to be able to add new features  \\n to only one section of the website  \\n and not have to redo the whole website.  \\n So I add that in.  \\n Here in the Use case add Able to add a new feature  \\n to only one section of the website.  \\n Now you have a complete picture of not only what's required,  \\n but you also have a valuable tool to help organize  \\n and logically analyze your requirements.  \\n Anything that stakeholders want to see in the project,  \\n you can trace and show the value of each small piece  \\n is adding to the larger overall objectives.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3025079\",\"duration\":371,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Tracing requirements through testing\",\"fileName\":\"3001270_en_US_01_03_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn how to utilize your requirements to facilitate testing and confirmation of the delivered solution.

 \\n Well, what do you test?  \\n So we literally add a column for test case.  \\n I'll expand that out a little bit.  \\n And then I always put a test case  \\n description in the next column,  \\n again, expanding out to fit.  \\n And I'll even wrap the text for easier reading.  \\n This way, now, I start capturing the details  \\n of what we're testing, that we truly delivered  \\n the value adding features.  \\n Say for the smartphone requirement,  \\n I'm going to break up the acceptance criteria  \\n and do small, more manageable tests.  \\n First let's make sure the smartphone can access the website.  \\n So I'll add a test case, access via smartphone,  \\n and I'll put a description in there.  \\n Website is accessible from smartphone  \\n and displays all website features.  \\n So I know now what we'll be testing,  \\n but I'll add another row because there's more  \\n than one test case for requirement,  \\n and that's perfectly normal.  \\n I'll add another row and just ensure  \\n I copied down all the trace requirements.  \\n And so here, I'll add another test case to subscribe  \\n to the sales promotions via smartphone,  \\n and then I'll enter a description  \\n of what I'm testing and validating here.  \\n On a mobile device, we want to be able to select  \\n subscribe to sales promotions,  \\n able to enter our email address and select subscribe,  \\n and then get a confirmation screen that shows to the user.  \\n We're getting a lot of details here,  \\n but the traceability matrix is what helps keep you focused.  \\n If you're editing these items,  \\n we want to trace them all the way through testing.  \\n So now you add in an expected outcomes in the next column.  \\n I'll enter expected outcomes in column M.  \\n Here now in this column is where you can  \\n enter what you expect to happen.  \\n So say for our smartphone test case,  \\n I'll enter of the expected outcome of that on a smartphone,  \\n navigation and menus, subscription features, reservation,  \\n amenity, views, they all display.  \\n And I'll do this now for every single test case,  \\n as this is where you define what is right  \\n or correct functionality that we want our testers to verify.  \\n We then add in the next column, actual outcomes.  \\n I'm going to expand it to fit.  \\n This is where testers can capture  \\n what actually happened when testing.  \\n So that means I'll need another column.  \\n So now I'm going to add in a status column.  \\n Status.  \\n This allows me to track the status of each test case.  \\n As for the results, if the expected outcome  \\n is the exact same as the actual outcome,  \\n then we know the test case has passed.  \\n And so I would simply put the status here as pass.  \\n We'll center for easy reading.  \\n If the expected and actuals, though, do not match,  \\n then the test case is a fail.  \\n And you'd want to now do some  \\n root cause analysis whenever test cases fail.  \\n But the status column is really helpful  \\n to help you manage your entire testing effort,  \\n as you could add in additional statuses,  \\n such as not started and in progress.  \\n And so now you're not just managing requirements,  \\n you're tracking the entire delivery  \\n of those requirements by keeping them traced.  \\n And the coolest thing, if you've tested everything,  \\n and they all pass, then you know  \\n you've delivered all the requirements.  \\n Why?

 \\n It works.  \\n 'Cause next, we want to get visual.  \\n And so, I'll open up a blank page in my modeling software.  \\n I'm using Lucidchart, but anything that can do  \\n visual representations works.  \\n And I'll start with a basic sticky note.  \\n Sticky notes are by far one of the best tools,  \\n whether in-person or digital.  \\n The trick is to write one step per note,  \\n such as first, the customer calls into the call center.  \\n So I'll write, customer calls call center.  \\n And then, the call center greets the customer.  \\n So I'll write, call center greets customer  \\n on a new sticky note.  \\n Next, the call center asks for the customer's name.  \\n And the customer then provides their name.  \\n So then, the call center asks  \\n what the nature of the call is.  \\n So the customer provides explanation for calling.  \\n Call center thanks the customer for calling  \\n and routes the call to the right person  \\n to assist the customer.  \\n That's it, just lay them out.  \\n This creates that really clear picture of  \\n what does and does not happen in the work,  \\n and that's what we want.  \\n Going back to our caller scenario,  \\n the customer says they are unable to login to the website.  \\n So we heard customer, so we label the swim lane.  \\n And now, my first swim lane is labeled Customer.  \\n Then we add the process step for the action  \\n this user is doing, the unable to log into the website.  \\n So I'll add a process box,  \\n unable to log into website.  \\n Next was the call center thanking the customer  \\n for the information and transferring to  \\n the website support team.  \\n So we heard call center now.  \\n So first, let's label the next swim lane.  \\n The next swim lane is labeled Call Center  \\n so we know that role is happening.  \\n We actually heard two process steps in that last comment.  \\n First, they thank the customer for the information.  \\n So I'll add that piece, thank customer for information.  \\n And then they said, transfers to the website support team.  \\n Now here, we have another role.  \\n So let's label that next swim lane as Website Support Team.  \\n Again, do this whenever you hear any role,  \\n just to keep you organized.  \\n So we ask then, what happens next,  \\n and the website support team answers the call  \\n and asks how they can help the customer.  \\n Again, I hear two actions, two activities happening there.  \\n I hear first, they answer the call.  \\n Then, they ask how they can help the customer.  \\n This is great to breakout as you go,  \\n being clear to enter the steps in the swim lane of  \\n who's doing the activity helps keep you really focused,  \\n as now, the customer explains the problem.  \\n So we go back up to Customer  \\n and we explain problem.  \\n Then, when the website support team resolves a problem,  \\n we scroll back down to the website support team swim lane  \\n and we add the process step,  \\n resolves problem.  \\n Notice I just put the steps.  \\n Always do this first.  \\n It keeps things simple.  \\n I'll now review what we've captured with my stakeholders,  \\n as when I do, this is when I'll add in some arrows  \\n to better show the flow of work, like this.  \\n Going back to the first step,  \\n we start with, the customer is unable to  \\n log into the website.  \\n Then, the call center thanks the customer  \\n for the information, so I'll connect these two.  \\n Who then, transfers the customer  \\n to the website support team, so connect that next.  \\n And then, the website support team answers the call,  \\n so draw down to that.  \\n And they ask how they can help, so that's next.  \\n Where the customer then explains their problem,  \\n so back to the customer.  \\n With their website support team then  \\n hopefully resolving the problem.  \\n And so, back down  \\n to the website support team.  \\n Now you can see, we have a complete process flow of  \\n how the work is done and by whom.  \\n I know, probably not that simple in your work,  \\n but the process is exactly the same.  \\n Add your swim lanes, add your process steps,  \\n then connect your process steps as you confirm the workflow.  \\n And then, you'll leave with a clear picture for everyone  \\n of how things work.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3025080\",\"duration\":174,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using process models for process analysis\",\"fileName\":\"3001270_en_US_02_03_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"This video shows you how to identify the different levels of detail of your process models to use with your analysis work.

 \\n And my stakeholders might say an upgrade to website.  \\n So I'll add an element, upgraded website,  \\n or they might mention marketing, so I'll add that in.  \\n And I'll ask who do we have to work with?  \\n And they mention IT, sales team, customer service.  \\n So let's add those in.  \\n IT,  \\n sales team  \\n and customer service.  \\n I'll then ask what other projects  \\n or activities are also going on  \\n or we have to consider.  \\n There's mention of a CRM upgrade  \\n as well as marketing planning for some holiday specials.  \\n So we'll note those here  \\n by adding context of a CRM upgrade  \\n and marketing holiday specials.  \\n Again, I like to have my stakeholders  \\n give me as much information as possible in a live session,  \\n but don't be afraid to continue to add an update.  \\n You may add in anything else you find  \\n during your analysis work  \\n as you can always confirm and validate items  \\n as you continue to review and use your diagram.  \\n Now once you have the items here,  \\n then you think about the relationships.  \\n That's what a line represents  \\n when you do a context diagram.  \\n You can start asking questions like  \\n what is the relationship?  \\n Does one have one of the other?  \\n A one-to-many relationship?  \\n Is there data flowing from one source to another?  \\n Are messages being sent and received between two items?  \\n Does one depend on the other?  \\n Or is one a small component or subset of the larger one?  \\n And if you have this one, must you have the other element?  \\n So going back to our diagram, I look at our central idea,  \\n our website upgrade, and think about how it relates  \\n to each of the elements we added.  \\n So for our website upgrade,  \\n we'll deliver an upgraded website.  \\n I grab an arrow tool and connect website upgrade  \\n to upgraded website and label the relationship as delivers.  \\n And again, for marketing, draw the line,  \\n then label it simply needs marketing.  \\n And I'll continue to ask this relationship question  \\n for each element listed,  \\n connecting each with a simple arrow,  \\n then labeling the relationship.  \\n Again, try to do this with your stakeholders  \\n so they give you the answer.  \\n Why?  \\n Because sometimes we think of something,  \\n but it's not really in scope.  \\n It's good to be aware of, sure,  \\n but just doesn't apply at this point in time,  \\n like the IT is worried about the change  \\n in leadership right now.  \\n So go ahead and add that to the diagram,  \\n change in leadership,  \\n and when I ask how is this connected  \\n to our website upgrade project?  \\n And no one knows.  \\n So then I just leave it.  \\n It's a great way to show items  \\n that could potentially be out of scope,  \\n but lets you acknowledge this stakeholder's input.  \\n Also, because this is an analysis tool,  \\n it's okay if you have some lines missing.  \\n This just means you have to do some more analysis work  \\n to find out how and why,  \\n even if the item is related or included.  \\n And so, the final key is then to use your diagram  \\n throughout your entire change effort.  \\n Don't just create once and toss to the side.  \\n Every time there's a discussion about designs, delivery,  \\n or even simply, should the team do something or not?  \\n Pull out the diagram.  \\n It's a great tangible item to bounce ideas off of,  \\n but then, also consider it a living document.  \\n What I mean is, as your work evolves,  \\n if new information is found out,  \\n then simply add it to your diagram.  \\n If something changes, then change the diagram,  \\n maybe even highlighting the change,  \\n because then, at the end of your effort or project,  \\n you'll have not only a powerful visual of the change,  \\n you'll have a resource that can continue  \\n to be used for future efforts.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3017842\",\"duration\":280,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using a context data flow diagram\",\"fileName\":\"3001270_en_US_03_03_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"This video shows you how to create and utilize a context data flow diagram.

 \\n In this case, there might be a simple confirmation message.  \\n So I draw a line with an arrow going back to the web form,  \\n and then label it as confirmation message.  \\n And so you keep asking what else?  \\n I'll put the CRM system on here since someone mentioned it,  \\n customer relationship management system.  \\n So as a good analyst, then I ask, how is this related?  \\n And my stakeholders may say that the subscription feature  \\n needs to save the customer profile with their email address  \\n in our CRM database.  \\n Okay, two things here, though.  \\n First, save customer profile with email.  \\n So let's add that connection.  \\n Then I heard CRM database, so let's add that here.  \\n 'Cause this is a storage location,  \\n not a function or system like our other circles,  \\n I'm going to use a box and label it CRM database.  \\n This notation is common, you'll see,  \\n when doing data flow diagrams,  \\n but don't worry too much about format right now.  \\n Now I'll add the arrow that the CRM data,  \\n in this case, customer profile and customer email,  \\n are stored in this database.  \\n And then again, think about any data coming back.  \\n We add in that arrow  \\n that the CRM system receives confirmation  \\n of both the stored profile and email address.  \\n Now we are starting to get some great context  \\n and set space for good questions,  \\n as seeing this, my stakeholders then might ask,  \\n what if the customer profile already exists?  \\n Remember, we want both current and future customers.  \\n So we can add in another line to update customer profile.  \\n And then as a customer,  \\n I want to see my profile and just update or confirm it.  \\n So the CRM system would return the current customer profile  \\n to user of this subscription feature.  \\n So draw that in here,  \\n that CRM system returns current customer profile.  \\n Notice there's no order here.  \\n We're solely focused on the data,  \\n knowing what is being sent where.  \\n Helps to get some logical structure for your solutions.  \\n A best practice is to include maybe a process model  \\n to help you articulate when and what is occurring  \\n that creates these data calls and processes.  \\n And so you keep asking what data  \\n the subscription feature needs.  \\n There's talk about showing product information  \\n based on subscription selections, so we add that in.  \\n And when we inquire where this data is,  \\n we learned there's a whole other database  \\n that marketing uses to manage product information.  \\n So we add that in, too.  \\n And now, don't forget about that web form.  \\n Where is that data being entered?  \\n Perhaps an IT person already decided  \\n it's using a Google form,  \\n so we just note that here for now, Google Form.  \\n And I'm using a different shape to help me realize  \\n this is an external item,  \\n what they might call an external entity.  \\n And so this form displays the form fields.  \\n So connect that back.  \\n Now, we've got some great context on what data we need  \\n and where it resides  \\n to start getting a better grasp  \\n on what the subscription feature actually is  \\n and needs to look like that we can continue to work with  \\n as we deliver the final solution.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

Analysis of business needs have been around  \\n for over three decades.  \\n It's just been known by different names  \\n and done a little differently by different individuals.  \\n Recently, we've seen standards developed  \\n to support these activities.  \\n These activities are referred to as business analysis.  \\n But depending on which standards you're using,  \\n business analysis might look slightly different.  \\n Let's look at some definitions from the two major groups  \\n that are setting these current standards.  \\n You'll see that these groups have  \\n slightly different definitions  \\n that highlight different emphasis of business analysis.  \\n First, we look at the  \\n International Institute of Business Analysis,  \\n otherwise known as IIBA.  \\n They define business analysis as  \\n the practice of enabling change  \\n in the context of an enterprise  \\n by defining needs and recommending solutions  \\n that deliver value to stakeholders.  \\n So here you see, IIBA emphasizes the importance of BA  \\n within the business to enable change.  \\n You're supporting the strategic direction  \\n of the organization by enabling these changes.  \\n Now, the Project Management Institute, or PMI,  \\n has a different flavor to their definition of BA.  \\n PMI focuses mainly on project managers and their activities.  \\n So the way they approach BA is more about  \\n supporting the project manager or the project effort.  \\n You see this in their definition of business analysis.  \\n They define business analysis as  \\n the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques  \\n to determine problems and identify business needs,  \\n identify and recommend viable solutions  \\n for meeting those needs,  \\n elicit, document and manage stakeholder requirements  \\n in order to meet business and project objectives and  \\n facilitate the successful implementation of the product,  \\n service, or end result of the programmer project.  \\n So notice some key phrases here, stakeholder requirements,  \\n and facilitate the successful implementation.  \\n PMI places a big emphasis on understanding  \\n of the requirements of all stakeholders.  \\n Also different from the IIBA definition,  \\n we see PMI talks about implementation.  \\n They frame the BA role as being responsible  \\n for the implementation of the result.  \\n When PMI defines a project, they define it as being able to  \\n deliver a service, a product, or a result.  \\n When you do business analysis,  \\n we also say you're delivering a solution.  \\n So what do we do with all this information?  \\n Well, the takeaway is that business analysis  \\n is defined in different ways  \\n depending on the point of view of the definer.  \\n But here's a stable definition  \\n that should work across all contexts.  \\n Business analysis seeks to identify and understand  \\n business needs and provide solutions to enable change.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4361188\",\"duration\":251,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"What is the role of a business analyst?\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_en_US_01_03_2022Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about the role of business analysts, where they work, and how they contribute to an organization's objectives.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3794637,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

Since we don't have unlimited time and resources  \\n to address the various needs of the organization,  \\n we need to document our findings in a manner  \\n that helps with the prioritization of work to be done.  \\n As we do our needs assessment,  \\n we need to gather relevant data  \\n to make sure that we understand the magnitude  \\n of the problem or opportunity.  \\n This helps us make sure that we properly size the solution.  \\n Once we understand the need,  \\n with the supporting data,  \\n the business analyst drafts a situation statement  \\n to provide not just what the situation was  \\n that we encountered,  \\n but also the impact on the organization.  \\n The first part of a situation statement  \\n states the current problem to be solved  \\n or the opportunity that needs to be explored  \\n in a structured manner.  \\n The second part then identifies the impact  \\n of that situation on the organization.  \\n The format of this statement is:  \\n the problem or opportunity has the effect  \\n of X on the organization  \\n with the resulting impact of Y.  \\n So here's an example.  \\n The existing process for processing returns  \\n involves the need to submit paperwork  \\n duplicating the digital record.  \\n This results in significant delays and extra labor costs.  \\n The impact is that additional staff is hired  \\n to meet established quotas.  \\n It's critical to review this with the key stakeholders  \\n to make sure we've captured the situation correctly,  \\n so that we can develop a proposed solution  \\n that addresses the real problem or opportunity.  \\n One of the most commonly used tools  \\n to help correctly understand the situation  \\n is an Ishikawa diagram  \\n for documenting a root cause analysis of the problem.  \\n Another tool which is used in adaptive or agile projects  \\n is the five whys.  \\n We can also create models of the flow of processes  \\n to help discover where problems might exist,  \\n and then recommend solutions.  \\n We might recommend a solution  \\n by just making a modification to the current process  \\n without any additional resources needed.  \\n Once we've defined the situation,  \\n it's time to move on to a potential solution.  \\n The solution is something that is developed  \\n to deliver measurable business value.  \\n It could be a new product,  \\n components of a product,  \\n an enhancement of an existing product,  \\n or just a fix.  \\n The solution statement recommends  \\n the most viable option to meet the need.  \\n The solution statement or approach defines at a high level  \\n the areas to be included or the initial scope  \\n and possible steps to move from the current situation  \\n or state to a future state.  \\n If there are multiple options,  \\n weighted criteria may also be used  \\n to propose the best option  \\n that will be further expanded upon in the business case.  \\n Before developing a final solution statement,  \\n we may need to do a feasibility study  \\n to help gather more information.  \\n This may include reviewing operational capability  \\n and the ability to either change or sustain the change.  \\n This may include  \\n whether the solution is technically feasible,  \\n whether it might work in the current environment,  \\n as well as help estimating potential cost  \\n or time requirements.  \\n We never want to provide only one solution.  \\n Instead, we provide multiple options.  \\n This allows the stakeholders to choose the one  \\n they think has the best chance of success.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

 \\n We need to make sure we know who our stakeholders are.  \\n Once we understand the need,  \\n the business analyst has to identify anyone  \\n who might be impacted by what we have been analyzing.  \\n These are usually referred to as \\\"stakeholders.\\\"  \\n The definition of a stakeholder is  \\n \\\"any individual, group, or organization  \\n that may be affected by,  \\n or perceive itself to be affected by,  \\n or can impact a decision, activity, or outcome  \\n of a program or project.\\\"  \\n Stakeholders can include several people:  \\n the group or individuals who initially propose the study,  \\n those who will benefit from the solution,  \\n those who have special knowledge of the current situation,  \\n and those that will use, support, or implement the result.  \\n So yes, stakeholders are often thought of  \\n as those affected by the project.  \\n But we also need to consider those stakeholders  \\n who will be affecting us.  \\n Usually, it's regulatory groups.  \\n For example, if you need to get a permit  \\n and it takes forever to get it approved,  \\n that can impact your schedule.  \\n Any group, either internal or external,  \\n that requires specific compliance  \\n can impact your work.  \\n An example of an internal stakeholder might be purchasing.  \\n Likely, they have a set of vendors you can buy from.  \\n But they don't realize that  \\n what you need to buy has to be compliant  \\n with certain standards.  \\n And the approved vendors don't comply.  \\n So you can't buy what you need.  \\n You can now see how the notion of a stakeholder can vary.  \\n The BA needs to be aware of and anticipate  \\n what impact they may have on the project.  \\n So how many stakeholders do we usually engage with?

 \\n How much detail? Which details?  \\n Have a conversation with your stakeholders  \\n to make sure you're on the same page  \\n with their expectations.  \\n You'll also want to determine the timeframe  \\n and frequency of communication.  \\n But this doesn't mean that the stakeholder  \\n can order information from you like a menu.  \\n We have to understand the reason  \\n that specific information is required at that time  \\n and what the expected result or impact will be upon receipt.  \\n As the project progresses,  \\n we need to continue monitoring  \\n how we will keep the stakeholders engaged.  \\n We'll always have new stakeholders join in the project  \\n while other stakeholders remove themselves.  \\n Continual monitoring  \\n of the involvement of stakeholders is important.  \\n This allows us to determine why involvement may have changed  \\n and whether additional engagements are needed.  \\n Here's a final tip that's always helped me:  \\n figure out how much time you need  \\n for individual stakeholders,  \\n especially those that are executives.  \\n Then preschedule them for the times when you need them.  \\n Reserve dates and times  \\n for meetings with these stakeholders.  \\n They're going to be surprised  \\n by how much of their time you really need.  \\n You need to continually remind them, though,  \\n of their importance to the result of the project.  \\n By the end of the project,  \\n you want to make sure they feel their engagement  \\n was well worth the time spent.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

Requirements come in all shapes and forms,  \\n but don't let that confuse you.  \\n In a nutshell, requirements are what we need to do,  \\n they're what we need to do to satisfy the customer.  \\n But what the customer puts in their list  \\n of requirements isn't necessarily what we'll eventually do.  \\n It's a wish list that gives us a direction,  \\n and depending on where you work, or who the client is,  \\n these requirements come to us in different formats.  \\n It's our job to interpret that list,  \\n and then determine the most appropriate way  \\n to fulfill the customer's needs.  \\n So let's review the different types of requirements.  \\n There are six major categories.  \\n First, the business requirements.  \\n They represent the higher level needs of the organization.  \\n Usually business requirements are identified  \\n through the needs assessment process,  \\n as either issues or opportunities.  \\n They're the reason why the project was selected  \\n and justified in the first place.  \\n The stakeholder requirements describe the needs  \\n of individual stakeholders, or groups of stakeholders.  \\n These requirements could come from within the organization,  \\n internally, or from customers, suppliers, partners,  \\n or other external organizations.  \\n Solution requirements describe the features, functions,  \\n and characteristics of the result.  \\n By result, I mean this is what the customer wants  \\n at the end of our work.  \\n Solution requirements have two subcategories,  \\n functional and nonfunctional requirements.  \\n Functional requirements describe what the user  \\n will be able to do, or what they'll receive when we're done.  \\n So this could be something like an online shopping site  \\n being able to process orders or returns.  \\n This type of requirement is just a high level example  \\n of the features to be included.  \\n Nonfunctional requirements on the other hand,  \\n describe environment, or quality of service conditions.  \\n These can also include technology requirements.  \\n An example might be the security requirements  \\n for your online store's credit card processing.  \\n Another category, transition requirements.  \\n These include the activities who help transition  \\n from the current state to the desired future state.  \\n These include training, documentation, and possibly  \\n conversion and implementation requirements.  \\n Now the next set of requirements are interesting  \\n because these are the responsibilities  \\n of the project manager, not the business analyst,  \\n but we still need to know them  \\n to have a full picture of the process.  \\n I'm talking about project requirements.  \\n They're often specified by either agreements  \\n or internal procedures.  \\n They include processes and deliverables  \\n to ensure that the project is completed on time.  \\n These may include management reviews,  \\n status updates, and performance reports.  \\n The last set of requirements identify  \\n the quality levels required.  \\n They're the responsibility of either a quality analyst  \\n or a group, like quality assurance.  \\n These include the conditions or capability used  \\n to assess conformance to the requirements.  \\n Regardless of the type of requirement,  \\n it's important to define how requirements  \\n will be managed and tracked.  \\n To do this, you use the requirements management plan,  \\n and the traceability matrix, but don't worry about that,  \\n we'll address those in another video.  \\n What's important is managing and understanding requirements,  \\n because this helps you control the scope.  \\n Once you finalize your requirements  \\n and scope boundaries, stick to them.  \\n Requirements start out as an unreprioritized wishlist,  \\n so it's important to be clear  \\n about exactly which ones have been selected.  \\n That way you're more likely to provide the greatest value.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4364147\",\"duration\":237,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Requirements elicitation techniques\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_en_US_06_02_2022Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to identify different elicitation techniques.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3583022,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - There are lots of ways to do elicitation,  \\n and you'll want to customize your strategy to each situation.  \\n Different stakeholders mean different elicitation  \\n techniques.  \\n One common technique  \\n uses structured or facilitated sessions.  \\n You have a facilitator that guides the conversation  \\n of the participants, prompts brainstorming,  \\n and makes sure that the session fulfills its goal.  \\n Facilitated workshops are great for a couple of reasons.  \\n One, they can be used throughout the project.  \\n It allows us to make the elicitation process  \\n truly iterative.  \\n Two, you can bring cross-functional participants together.  \\n Having diverse participants naturally uncovers gaps,  \\n redundancies, needs, and other important information.  \\n Finally, having a facilitator means someone is there  \\n to help with communication between stakeholders,  \\n leading to better relationships and consensus.  \\n Interviews have been used for years.  \\n They're basically three loose categories  \\n of interview styles.  \\n Highly structured, with predefined questions.  \\n Semi-structured, with some prepared questions,  \\n and follow up on answers or,  \\n unstructured interviews where you allow the conversation  \\n to develop naturally.  \\n These are most appropriate when confidential  \\n or sensitive information is needed,  \\n or the information is needed from high level managers.  \\n You can do these face to face, over the phone,  \\n video conferences, through email,  \\n or even have the person record the responses  \\n into an audio file.  \\n In addition, we collect and analyze existing documentation.  \\n A major focus of our analysis is to ask,  \\n \\\"Why certain information is even there?\\\"  \\n The answer, \\\"Because it's always been done that way,\\\"  \\n is not a valid response.  \\n What I've often done is have the stakeholders  \\n take the documentation of a process,  \\n and literally circle what they use or don't.  \\n It can be a really revealing process for them  \\n and it's a quick way for me to get to the heart  \\n of what matters and what doesn't.  \\n You could also try shadowing people  \\n in their environment while performing their duties.  \\n If you have a large number of stakeholders  \\n use questionnaires and surveys.  \\n Remember though that open-ended questions  \\n obtain more detailed responses,  \\n but will require additional time to consolidate.  \\n One word of caution here, the process can get very lengthy.  \\n You want to be thorough,  \\n but don't fall into analysis paralysis.  \\n Constrain yourself to two phases.  \\n One, initial elicitation  \\n during the needs assessment activities.  \\n A second discovery is done after the project  \\n has been initiated.  \\n It's an iterative process.  \\n Okay.  \\n You have to choose your elicitation techniques.  \\n This is what you should consider,  \\n the type of project and approach used,  \\n time and budget constraints,  \\n number and location of stakeholders,  \\n and requirement documentation type and detail required.  \\n So regardless of the technique you choose,  \\n elicitation activities take up project resources.  \\n So choose wisely so your time spent appropriately  \\n defines the product solution.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4361190\",\"duration\":218,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using requirements modeling techniques\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_en_US_06_03_2022Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to use process and data modeling.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3292830,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Let's talk about the importance  \\n of modeling business requirements.  \\n As a business analyst,  \\n you're very important to the project effort  \\n because of your ability to not just discover requirements,  \\n but also to analyze those requirements.  \\n To best wrap our mind around this,  \\n we develop various models  \\n to look at requirements from three points of view,  \\n nouns, verbs, and rules.  \\n Let's take the example.  \\n I, as a customer, want to order a camera  \\n to take photos of my family.  \\n If you break the requirement down,  \\n \\\"to order\\\" is the verb and the \\\"camera\\\" is the noun.  \\n Keep in mind though  \\n that there are some unspoken rules in there, too.  \\n You'll utilize two key models  \\n to break the requirements down.  \\n One for the process or verbs, call process modeling,  \\n and one for the data or nouns, call data modeling.  \\n Easy to remember, right?  \\n So we create the process model firs.  \\n To understand the various steps required,  \\n you'll be looking for those verbs.  \\n One of the best methods to do this is  \\n by having a face-to-face discussion  \\n with your business stakeholders at a white board.  \\n You can use the board to take notes, sketch drawings,  \\n and capture the discussion.  \\n Start by drawing out the order  \\n in which things happen, your verbs.  \\n That will complete your process model.  \\n Next, ask what's the noun or the product.  \\n Cameras? Customers?  \\n Are there different types of cameras  \\n or different types of customers?  \\n We use what's called data modeling techniques  \\n to figure it out.  \\n Now, picture yourself adding your nouns or products  \\n to the whiteboard on stickies.  \\n The first part of the data modeling technique is done.  \\n And now you can move on to the business rule model.  \\n Let's refer back to what we already know.  \\n Our nouns and verbs are what make the rules.  \\n Picture yourself with your stakeholder, again.  \\n You'll be listening during the discussion  \\n for relationships and differences.  \\n Here's a pro tip.  \\n Stickies are an effective way to show the differences,  \\n in this case,  \\n between different types of customers and cameras.  \\n Once identified, these rules identify the steps  \\n that apply for individual customers,  \\n as well as any pricing discounts that might apply.  \\n Now, the process model, data model,  \\n and business rule model will help you  \\n analyze requirements individually.  \\n But the real power comes from bringing it all together.  \\n Don't worry if you don't have formal complete models.  \\n Fragments of requirements still help you know  \\n what steps are needed to fulfill an order request,  \\n which exact product is being requested,  \\n what price is being charged  \\n depending on the product and the customer, et cetera.  \\n If you can map everything together,  \\n you'll be able to deliver a solution  \\n that exceeds the customer's expectations  \\n while still following the rules  \\n established by the organization.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"6.

When I buy something online,  \\n I really like that I can track the package  \\n from its original warehouse all the way to my door.  \\n Similarly, I can follow my Uber or Lyft driver  \\n as they make their way to my location.  \\n The reason this is so satisfying  \\n is that I can predict when the value will be delivered  \\n and I can also tell when the planned arrival is disrupted.  \\n We track our packages, our rides and even our friends.  \\n Wouldn't it make sense to do something similar  \\n for expensive work projects?  \\n In developing your business analysis plan,  \\n you have to decide how requirements will be traced  \\n to ensure they're all delivered and approved.  \\n You'll do this by determining a traceability approach  \\n and using a traceability matrix.  \\n The traceability approach  \\n is a way of thinking about how requirements are related  \\n and tracking them.  \\n The project team should be able to trace  \\n a single requirement to its supporting objectives  \\n and other related requirements.  \\n The traceability approach also allows  \\n for the visibility of progress on individual requirements.  \\n It clearly exposes obstacles  \\n that are preventing requirements from progressing.  \\n Appropriate actions can then be taken  \\n to remove those obstacles.  \\n The traceability matrix  \\n is how you use the traceability approach  \\n to track your project.  \\n It's a tool you actually use.  \\n You might have seen this before  \\n in the form of a task board in Scrum or a kanban board.  \\n What you do is arrange a few columns  \\n with titles that represent the status of the requirements.  \\n Typically, the columns are labeled to-do,  \\n in progress and done.  \\n Now, the in progress column could be further subdivided  \\n to show phases of the organization's methodology  \\n including maybe analysis, design,  \\n development, tests, et cetera.  \\n On these physical boards,  \\n the connections between requirements and objectives  \\n are visualized by sticky notes  \\n and moved between defined columns.  \\n These are extraordinarily helpful  \\n but a traceability matrix is a digital document  \\n used to not just visualize the progress  \\n but to consolidate all of your documentation in one place.  \\n You can understand the current status  \\n of individual requirements  \\n and link to other important documents.  \\n These may include use cases, analysis models,  \\n design documents, test plans, cases and results.  \\n Acceptance sign-offs are also often included.  \\n The more detailed traceability matrix  \\n often has a space dedicated to linking  \\n high level requirements  \\n also referred to as features or epics  \\n to smaller user stories.  \\n They can also connect each requirement  \\n to the corresponding business and project objectives.  \\n The traceability matrix should act as a single source  \\n to connect all project requirement documentation.  \\n You can use the matrix  \\n to assess the impact of changes to requirements  \\n and the overall project scope.  \\n This assessment allows changes to be addressed  \\n and quantified from a risk, cost or time perspective.  \\n As new requirements are approved,  \\n they're added to the traceability matrix.  \\n You trace them as they are implemented.  \\n Now, the amount of detail you include  \\n is dependent on the size, complexity  \\n and importance of the project.  \\n Also note that you can certainly have a task board as well  \\n but the traceability matrix  \\n acts as the central hub for information.  \\n Use the traceability matrix as your primary tool  \\n for tracking your efforts, improving communication  \\n and clarifying your progress.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4364148\",\"duration\":173,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Change control\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_en_US_07_02_2022Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to analyze a change request and its impact on a project.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2622610,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

Since we don't have unlimited time and resources  \\n to address the various needs of the organization,  \\n we need to document our findings in a manner  \\n that helps with the prioritization of work to be done.  \\n As we do our needs assessment,  \\n we need to gather relevant data  \\n to make sure that we understand the magnitude  \\n of the problem or opportunity.  \\n This helps us make sure  \\n that we properly size the solution.  \\n Once we understand the need with the supporting data,  \\n the business analyst drafts a situation statement  \\n to provide not just what the situation was  \\n that we encountered,  \\n but also the impact on the organization.  \\n The first part of a situation statement  \\n states the current problem to be solved  \\n or the opportunity that needs to be explored  \\n in a structured manner.  \\n The second part then identifies the impact  \\n of that situation on the organization.  \\n The format of this statement is the problem or opportunity  \\n has the effect of x on the organization  \\n with the resulting impact of y.  \\n So here's an example.  \\n The existing process for processing returns  \\n involves the need to submit paperwork  \\n duplicating the digital record.  \\n This results in significant delays  \\n and extra labor costs.  \\n The impact is that additional staff is hired  \\n to meet established quotas.  \\n It's critical to review this with the key stakeholders  \\n to make sure we've captured the situation correctly,  \\n so that we can develop a proposed solution  \\n that addresses the real problem or opportunity.  \\n One of the most commonly used tools  \\n to help correctly understand the situation  \\n is an Ishikawa diagram  \\n for documenting a root cause analysis of the problem.  \\n Another tool which is used in adaptive or agile projects  \\n is the Five Why's.  \\n We can also create models of the flow of processes  \\n to help discover where problems might exist,  \\n and then recommend solutions.  \\n We might recommend a solution  \\n by just making a modification to the current process  \\n without any additional resources needed.  \\n Once we define the situation,  \\n it's time to move on to a potential solution.  \\n The solution is something that is developed  \\n to deliver measurable business value.  \\n It could be a new product, components of a product,  \\n an enhancement of an existing product, or just a fix.  \\n The solution statement recommends  \\n the most viable option to meet the need.  \\n The solution statement or approach defines at a high level  \\n the areas to be included or the initial scope,  \\n and possible steps to move  \\n from the current situation or state to a future state.  \\n If there are multiple options,  \\n weighted criteria may also be used  \\n to propose the best option  \\n that will be further expanded upon in the business case.  \\n Before developing a final solution statement,  \\n we may need to do a feasibility study  \\n to help gather more information.  \\n This may include reviewing operational capability  \\n and the ability to either change or sustain the change.  \\n This may include whether the solution  \\n is technically feasible,  \\n whether it might work in the current environment,  \\n as well as help estimating potential costs  \\n or time requirements.  \\n We never want to provide only one solution.  \\n Instead, we provide multiple options.  \\n This allows the stakeholders to choose the one  \\n they think has the best chance of success.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

 \\n Sometimes we don't even know who these people are.  \\n Here's an example that might help you start thinking  \\n more broadly about stakeholders.  \\n So one of my neighbors was doing some construction.  \\n He got the permits from the city,  \\n he hired the trucks  \\n and notified the neighborhood  \\n that some big equipment would be making noise  \\n and occasionally blocking the road.  \\n But what he didn't realize was that the dirt kicked up  \\n from the construction would land on everyone's solar panels.  \\n Everybody was furious because now they had to get their  \\n panels professionally cleaned.  \\n The takeaway here is this,  \\n those stakeholders or neighbors really  \\n who had solar panels were impacted by the construction.  \\n He wasn't aware that those stakeholders  \\n would be impacted by his work.  \\n So what do we need to do?  \\n We need to make sure we know who our stakeholders are.  \\n Once we understand the need,  \\n the business analyst has to identify anyone  \\n who might be impacted by what we have been analyzing.  \\n These are usually referred to as stakeholders.  \\n The definition of a stakeholder is any individual, group  \\n or organization that may be affected by  \\n or perceive itself to be affected by  \\n or can impact a decision activity  \\n or outcome of a program or project.  \\n Stakeholders can include several people,  \\n the group or individuals who initially proposed the study,  \\n those who will benefit from the solution,  \\n those who have special knowledge of the current situation  \\n and those that will use, support  \\n or implement the result.  \\n So yes, stakeholders are often thought of  \\n as those affected by the project.  \\n But we also need to consider those stakeholders  \\n who will be affecting us.  \\n Usually, it's regulatory groups.  \\n For example, if you need to get a permit  \\n and it takes forever to get it approved,  \\n that can impact your schedule.  \\n Any group, either internal or external  \\n that requires specific compliance can impact your work.  \\n An example of an internal stakeholder might be purchasing,  \\n likely they have a set of vendors you can buy from.  \\n But they don't realize that what you need to buy  \\n has to be compliant with certain standards.  \\n And the approved vendors don't comply,  \\n so you can't buy what you need.  \\n You can now see how the notion of a stakeholder can vary.  \\n The BA needs to be aware of  \\n and anticipate what impact they may have on the project.  \\n So how many stakeholders do we usually engage with?  \\n Well, it depends,  \\n but it's never a small number.  \\n Identifying your stakeholders is just part of the challenge,  \\n but it's important that we know who we are impacting  \\n and who may have an impact on us.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2911934\",\"duration\":198,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Classifying your stakeholders\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_03_02_MM30_classify\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3020352,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Not all stakeholders are created equal.  \\n Some have a vision and some are deep down in the weeds.  \\n The first thing you need to ask yourself is this.  \\n Who've I been given and who do I really need?

Requirements come in all shapes and forms,  \\n but don't let that confuse you.  \\n In a nutshell,  \\n requirements are what we need to do.  \\n They're what we need to do to satisfy the customer,  \\n but what the customer puts in their list of requirements  \\n isn't necessarily what we'll eventually do.  \\n It's a wishlist that gives us a direction  \\n and depending on where you work or who the client is,  \\n these requirements come to us in different formats.  \\n It's our job to interpret that list  \\n and then determine the most appropriate way  \\n to fulfill the customer's needs.  \\n So, let's review the different types of requirements.  \\n There are six major categories.  \\n First, the business requirements.  \\n They represent the higher-level needs of the organization.  \\n Usually, business requirements are identified  \\n through the needs assessment process  \\n as either issues or opportunities.  \\n They're the reason why the project was selected  \\n and justified in the first place.  \\n The stakeholder requirements describe the needs  \\n of individual stakeholders or groups of stakeholders.  \\n These requirements could come  \\n from within the organization, internally  \\n or from customers, suppliers,  \\n partners or other external organizations.  \\n Solution requirements describe the features, functions  \\n and characteristics of the result.  \\n By result I mean,  \\n this is what the customer wants at the end of our work.  \\n Solution requirements have two sub categories,  \\n functional and nonfunctional requirements.  \\n Functional requirements describe  \\n what the user will be able to do  \\n or what they'll receive when we're done.  \\n So, this could be something like an online shopping site  \\n being able to process orders or returns.  \\n This type of requirement is just a high-level example  \\n of the features to be included.  \\n Nonfunctional requirements on the other hand,  \\n describe environment or quality of service conditions.  \\n These can also include technology requirements.  \\n An example might be the security requirements  \\n for your online store's credit card processing.  \\n Another category, transition requirements.  \\n These include the activities to help transition  \\n from the current state to the desired future state.  \\n These include training, documentation  \\n and possibly conversion and implementation requirements.  \\n Now, the next set of requirements are interesting  \\n because these are the responsibilities  \\n of the project manager not the business analyst,  \\n but we still need to know them  \\n to have a full picture of the process.  \\n I'm talking about project requirements.  \\n They're often specified by either agreements  \\n or internal procedures.  \\n They include processes and deliverables  \\n to ensure that the project is completed on time.  \\n These may include management reviews,  \\n status updates and performance reports.  \\n The last set of requirements  \\n identify the quality levels required.  \\n They're the responsibility of either a quality analyst  \\n or a group like quality assurance.  \\n These include the conditions or capability used  \\n to assess conformance to the requirements.  \\n Regardless of the type of requirement,  \\n it's important to define  \\n how requirements will be managed and tracked.  \\n To do this,  \\n and the traceability matrix,  \\n but don't worry about that,  \\n we'll address those in another video.  \\n What's important is managing and understanding requirements,  \\n because this helps you control the scope.  \\n Once you finalized your requirements and scope boundaries,  \\n stick to them.  \\n Requirements start out as an unprioritized wishlist.  \\n So, it's important to be clear  \\n about exactly which ones have been selected.  \\n That way you're more likely to provide the greatest value.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2917000\",\"duration\":237,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Requirements elicitation techniques\",\"fileName\":\"5016706_06_02_MM30_ellicitation\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Identify and describe different types of elicitation techniques.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":3587467,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

Think about how a bicycle or a car evolved over the years.  \\n Both were iterative and incremental  \\n in how they got to their current state.  \\n And both will continue to evolve.  \\n The relationship between elicitation  \\n and analysis is often a little bit of a mystery,  \\n and also involves elements of iterations and increments.  \\n In fact, I see a lot of teams acting  \\n and thinking like it's more of a phase,  \\n thinking that elicitation comes first in a phase  \\n and then analysis.  \\n And this really can't be further from the truth.  \\n What really happens is that we elicit  \\n to have something to analyze.  \\n And we analyze to know what more to elicit  \\n and determine what still needs to be discovered.  \\n This cycle continues until we feel  \\n like we have enough information  \\n to get started in delivering value.  \\n We want to make sure that this cycle of elicit  \\n and analyze is done in a highly collaborative way,  \\n using a variety of techniques  \\n to encourage dialogue, analysis and thinking in others.  \\n Some alone time yourself also helps along the way.  \\n Many teams fall into the trap of reviewing documents  \\n or texts in a tool to get approval  \\n without really doing any real elicitation or analysis.  \\n Text-based requirements reviews  \\n don't encourage the team to truly analyze or innovate.  \\n Text-based documentation can easily nudge the team  \\n into skipping the true essence of elicitation and analysis.  \\n So make sure that in the rush to document and approve,  \\n that elicitation, collaboration and analysis is not missed.  \\n I find that elicitation and analysis often happens  \\n at the same time in the same meeting,  \\n or in the same interaction points,  \\n meaning that some of the techniques we use to elicit  \\n are also used to analyze.  \\n For example, when interviewing a stakeholder,  \\n I ask questions to elicit.  \\n And while listening, I connect some pieces  \\n that cause me to ask more questions.  \\n Asking questions is eliciting,  \\n and connecting the pieces  \\n and discovering more questions is analysis.  \\n So for example, if I ask questions  \\n about a process, and then I do a process model,  \\n I eliciting by asking questions,  \\n and then I'm analyzing by doing the process model.  \\n Through the process model work that I do, I'm analyzing,  \\n and I'm likely going to come up with more questions  \\n to go back and elicit more information.  \\n Then I model and analyze again, and so forth.  \\n This is the iterative nature of elicitation and analysis.  \\n Elicitation and analysis also require planning.  \\n We need to consciously be aware  \\n of the techniques we plan to use and are using.  \\n We also need to adapt quickly  \\n if one of them isn't working.  \\n Great techniques make all the difference.  \\n When you are using the right technique  \\n to elicit and analyze,  \\n your stakeholders are having fun together.  \\n Everyone is learning and evolving their thoughts.  \\n The team is empowered to be innovative  \\n and serve the organization and the customer.  \\n The right techniques to elicit and analyze  \\n bring powerful dialogue to the team,  \\n insightful innovation and less rework overall.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2419079\",\"duration\":185,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Levels of detail in elicitation and analysis\",\"fileName\":\"580635_01_05_MM30_Levels_2021Q1\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, walk through the elicitation and analysis layers and explore how to progressively elaborate by using the concepts of detailed layers to ensure the customer\u2019s needs are met.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2811991,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

 \\n It also helps to look for any tools they are using  \\n outside the product or system,  \\n and to determine if the system is working as expected.  \\n There are basically two types of observation we can do:  \\n passive and active.  \\n When using passive observation,  \\n we don't interact with the user.  \\n We try to understand the process they use,  \\n and their emotions.  \\n We want to learn what is frustrating for them,  \\n and what is delighting them.  \\n And we do this by not talking or interacting with them.  \\n Passive observation is great  \\n in terms of taking less time from the user,  \\n or perhaps they do not even know you're watching.  \\n If they are aware you're watching or observing,  \\n it can make them nervous.  \\n So we have to be careful about that relationship,  \\n and make sure they're not changing their behavior  \\n because someone's watching.  \\n When doing active observation,  \\n we actually are working with the user.  \\n We ask questions during the process  \\n to better understand or confirm what we are seeing.  \\n Active observation takes a lot longer  \\n and interrupts the user.  \\n The results might be more accurate or less accurate  \\n depending on the context and on the person you're observing.  \\n You might get a super user, an average user,  \\n or perhaps a struggling user,  \\n and sometimes it's hard to tell  \\n which group you're observing.  \\n If you think the findings  \\n would vary dramatically based on the user type,  \\n it's a good practice to observe users  \\n at other skill levels as well.  \\n When observing, no matter if it's passive or active,  \\n some of the things you want to look out for are  \\n what feelings does the user have using the system?

Process models are kind of like a good conversation starter.  \\n They're the starting point  \\n of what will hopefully be a meaningful conversation.  \\n Process modeling is about creating a visual  \\n to explain a process or sequence of activities.  \\n It takes a lot of good conversations  \\n to deliver valuable solutions.  \\n That's probably why process modeling  \\n is the most commonly used technique  \\n for requirements analysis.  \\n It's a multi-purpose tool.  \\n You can use process models to ignite dialogue on the team,  \\n see where details fit into the big picture,  \\n visualize the process,  \\n organize requirements information,  \\n and analyze various detailed aspects  \\n of the product, system, or process.  \\n There are various levels of formality in process modeling,  \\n and I typically prefer a more informal style.  \\n I choose a more informal style  \\n because it supports the purpose  \\n of requirements analysis work,  \\n which tends to be more about dialogue,  \\n alignment, shared understanding,  \\n and capturing a memory of a conversation  \\n at many levels of detail.  \\n I find most business requirements work  \\n is more about the conversation,  \\n and to support good conversations,  \\n process models need to be simple.  \\n Stakeholders and the team need to be able  \\n to read and understand the models  \\n intuitively, without a tutorial.  \\n The dialogue when looking at a model  \\n should be about the process,  \\n not about how to read the diagram.  \\n More formal, intricate process models  \\n are great for detailed system analysis,  \\n or trying to have a machine read the process model.  \\n Here are my favorite go-to principles  \\n when using process models.  \\n First, know what you are modeling.  \\n Are you modeling the current state or future state?  \\n Typically, we're defining the future state  \\n with requirements,  \\n and only looking back when needed  \\n to reuse some of the current state.  \\n Be careful not to focus too much on the current state.  \\n We're designing the future, not the past.  \\n Next, the best process models  \\n progressively elaborate and are built in layers.  \\n Try not to put all the detail into a single model.  \\n Start high-level,  \\n and progress to the details layer by layer.  \\n Make it action-oriented and be specific.  \\n Name the process and its activities  \\n in a verb plus noun format.  \\n Avoid using ambiguous words like manage,  \\n process,  \\n handle,  \\n and coordinate.  \\n These words are so easy to get a group to agree on,  \\n but they build false consensus  \\n and cause more problems later.  \\n They are untestable, and they force developers  \\n to interpret or guess what's really needed or meant.  \\n I've attached an exercise file  \\n of words to avoid and words to use in your models.  \\n Now, let's look at an example.  \\n In this process flow for payment checkout,  \\n you see the verb plus noun format  \\n for every step in the process.  \\n The verbs used, select, enter, and confirm,  \\n are all actionable verbs  \\n that are testable and easily understood by developers.  \\n You may be wondering, what about all the details?  \\n If process models are supposed to stay simple,  \\n then where are the details  \\n like decisions, exceptions, and alternative paths tracked?  \\n We could model them all out, but that might get complicated.  \\n So instead, I prefer to use a decision table  \\n for each step in the process  \\n to show the logic within each step.  \\n I also like to align and attach other details,  \\n like scenarios and user interface mock-ups,  \\n to each step of the process flow.  \\n Using simple process models  \\n with details provided as supplements to each step  \\n helps teams collaborate more effectively.  \\n It keeps the information organized in buckets  \\n that are consumable and ready for conversation.  \\n Process models are great tools for requirements.  \\n When done right, they inspire great conversation, analysis,  \\n and prevent gaps.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2418087\",\"duration\":277,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Context diagrams\",\"fileName\":\"580635_03_03_MM30_Context_2021Q1\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about the requirements technique, context, and scope diagrams and why they are beneficial to teams.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":4172033,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - I talk a lot about the importance of techniques  \\n that get everyone on the same page.  \\n It's what I call shared understanding.  \\n To build shared understanding  \\n you can't dive into the details on day one.  \\n You need to start with the big picture. You need context.  \\n Context diagrams are one of my favorite analysis techniques.  \\n They show the solutions big picture  \\n by providing a view of a system or product  \\n in its environment including the people  \\n and systems it interacts with.  \\n A context diagram helps teams identify scenarios,  \\n users, user goals, and external systems.  \\n It provides an overall outside-in perspective.  \\n I love working with context diagrams  \\n because it helps the team stay out of the details  \\n until we truly know and understand the big picture.  \\n So let's take a look at our online coffee store case study  \\n and build a context diagram together.  \\n We have included an exercise file that provides a summary  \\n of this case study.  \\n So where do we start?  \\n The center of a context diagram represents the product name,  \\n solution or domain.  \\n In this case, our domain is online ordering.  \\n From there you want to add the key people  \\n or roles that interact with the online order.  \\n Of course you're including your primary customer,  \\n but then add other internal and external roles,  \\n like the manager, warehouse worker and shipper.  \\n It's also important to include key internal  \\n and external systems that support online ordering.  \\n This is a big part of the big picture  \\n that helps the team get an understanding of a system's scope  \\n and complexity and can identify missing stakeholders.  \\n In this case we would use rectangles  \\n to identify our payment processors  \\n like PayPal and the credit cards  \\n and also show a box for internal data stores.  \\n Notice we don't call out every data store individually.  \\n That's too much detail,  \\n but we did call out PayPal separate from credit cards.  \\n Can you guess why that might be important?  \\n Perhaps it's a new payment option  \\n our organization hasn't used before  \\n or we already know it requires  \\n a significantly different interface than our credit cards.  \\n Next, we explore the interactions between our entities  \\n and our goal using directional arrows.  \\n Each arrow and phrase represents the intentions  \\n of that user role or system with the solution.  \\n For example, our customer intends to browse items,  \\n place items in a cart and check out items.  \\n In return our solution needs to receive the order  \\n and send status notifications to the user.  \\n Our warehouse workers need to view the orders  \\n and update orders.  \\n Our credit card partners need to receive payment data  \\n and return payment confirmation data and so on,  \\n until all the primary interactions  \\n between entities are diagrammed.  \\n This context diagram is a great representation  \\n of the intended scope at a summary level  \\n that can be used throughout the project.  \\n A few tips when working with context diagrams.  \\n First, do not connect the user roles to each other  \\n or the rectangle entities.  \\n Though this may feel natural to do so,  \\n it implies sequence and this model is about interaction  \\n and data, not sequence.  \\n Next, try to keep it to about 15 total arrows.  \\n It will be tempting to get much more detailed,  \\n but worth it to keep it at a higher level  \\n to maintain readability.  \\n Other models will cover the details better.  \\n This model is about context and the big picture.  \\n Last, try not to make this a technical architecture diagram  \\n of the technical components.  \\n This is a context model to help with user and business  \\n point of view.  \\n When done right, leaders and QA teams, especially,  \\n love this diagram.  \\n It's a visual that everyone  \\n can quickly get on the same page with.  \\n The dialogue it creates with the team is

And the why or benefit is so that I don't have  \\n to reenter information.  \\n This story needs more details that come out in conversation  \\n and that conversation needs to be captured.  \\n We use acceptance criteria to show the details  \\n of what success looks like in this story  \\n from a user point of view.  \\n Acceptance criteria for this user story is  \\n how the online shopper would describe  \\n this story as working.  \\n For example, some acceptance criteria would look like this.  \\n When I enter a credit card number that does not match  \\n the type, I should be notified and be able  \\n to reenter to correct the issue.  \\n I also should be able to simply select the expiration date  \\n on a visual calendar, rather than type in a date.  \\n Our goal is to make each user story  \\n a discrete piece of user functionality.  \\n However, as the project evolves, it's quite common  \\n to discover user stories that are too big  \\n because they include multiple pieces of functionality  \\n that need to be discussed, analyzed,  \\n and prioritized, separately.  \\n In that case, we need to apply a story splitting technique.  \\n When splitting a story, we will keep it  \\n from a user point of view and avoid splitting  \\n by technical component or a team activity.  \\n For example, some ways to split  \\n our credit card story would be  \\n as an online shopper, I want to select the type  \\n of credit card I am using so that I can make sure  \\n my entry is accurate for the card type.  \\n As an online shopper, I want to enter the  \\n credit card number so that I can have it  \\n saved for future use.  \\n And, as an online shopper, I want to enter  \\n my expiration date so I can get my credit card validated  \\n as a form of payment.  \\n Splitting stories like this is important to breaking  \\n down the story into smaller pieces for deep dialog,  \\n analysis, and prioritizing what's important.  \\n As user stories are created and split  \\n a story map is a great way to analyze how  \\n all of the stories fit together.  \\n Organizing user stories in a visual format helps  \\n the entire team see the forest through the trees.  \\n A story map tells the whole story versus a small part of it.  \\n It's a technique that keeps the team focused  \\n on the user experience and results  \\n in better dialog and conversation.  \\n To create a user story map, we take all the user stories  \\n and place them in sequence of how a customer  \\n uses the product from left to right.  \\n The vertical columns of a story map provide the details  \\n under the higher level story or theme.  \\n For our online coffee store, user stories  \\n about browsing and searching would be on the left  \\n followed by selecting items, managing the cart, checkout,  \\n and on the far right, stories related  \\n to viewing shipping status or viewing previous orders.  \\n The stories listed vertically are detailed out such that  \\n the top line are buckets of stories or a theme  \\n and the detailed stories come below.  \\n Story mapping is a great way to discover gaps  \\n in requirements and analyze flow, data,  \\n and the user journey.  \\n User stories and story maps are  \\n great analysis techniques for all projects.  \\n I encourage you to continue to learn more  \\n about how to use this great

- We ask systems to make thousands of decisions every day.  \\n Getting the decision logic correct  \\n in our requirements is no easy task.  \\n Decision tables are a great way to organize  \\n and display decision logic,  \\n and I use them frequently for requirements analysis.  \\n Let's take a look at our online coffee store case study  \\n and use a payment example,  \\n and start thinking about which parts  \\n of the online payment process has decision logic.  \\n Things like if-then conditions, for example.  \\n One area that jumps out at me is shipping costs.  \\n Most companies have several different conditions  \\n that must be met to determine  \\n the appropriate shipping costs for an order.  \\n They might offer free shipping for preferred customers,  \\n discounted shipping for large orders  \\n or additional fees for next day shipping.  \\n These conditions, especially when combined  \\n generate dozens of decision paths  \\n that will make visual models  \\n sprawl across multiple pages, making it very hard  \\n for your stakeholders to understand and evaluate.  \\n In many cases, decisions are better modeled  \\n in a decision table.  \\n Let's start with a shipping calculation example.  \\n Here are the requirements written in a text format.  \\n To build a decision table,  \\n we start with defining the results  \\n or the decision to be made in the last column.  \\n In this case, the decision  \\n is not clear from the text requirement.  \\n However, when we ask ourselves  \\n what decision this logic supports,  \\n it becomes more obvious that the decision  \\n is to determine what costs  \\n the customer will pay for shipping.  \\n When considering this example,  \\n we need to analyze the text for the decisions and scenarios.  \\n So next we analyze the text-based rules for the conditions  \\n that contribute to making the decision  \\n and add them as column headers on the table.  \\n In this case, we would end up with conditions such as,  \\n are they a preferred customer?  \\n Is the order over $50?  \\n Is it standard versus rush shipping?  \\n Ideally, we want the conditions to be binary,  \\n a yes/no condition.  \\n And the ideal table has between two and four conditions.  \\n With these boundaries, the table stays small and manageable.  \\n If you have more conditions,  \\n consider putting together multiple tables  \\n that build into one.  \\n So now that we have the result and the conditions,  \\n we need to determine how many possible scenarios there are.  \\n When the conditions are a yes or no  \\n this calculation is easy.  \\n It's an exponent calculation.  \\n So for this one, three conditions  \\n with two options each  \\n is two raised to the third power or two cubed.  \\n With this math our decision table  \\n will have eight rows or eight scenarios.  \\n And this shows the importance of using  \\n binary yes/no conditions and keeping conditions limited.  \\n If not limited, the table gets very large  \\n and hard to review and analyze.  \\n Okay, so now we have the results,  \\n the conditions and the total number of scenarios.  \\n Next, we extrapolate out the eight scenarios  \\n into the various combinations.  \\n Now we are ready to determine the decisions  \\n of this logic and confirm them as a team.  \\n And this means completing the results column of the table.  \\n I like having the table prepared to this point  \\n and then reviewing with key stakeholders to gain consensus  \\n on the result column values.  \\n Keeping it collaborative like this gets others involved.  \\n Make sure to provide the framework of the table  \\n like the conditions and results,  \\n and a few example rows completed to get the group going.  \\n Using a decision table helps us pause to identify  \\n all of the scenarios and puts the logic  \\n into an easy to read, discuss, and review format.  \\n Developers and testers also love having this guide  \\n to make sure they're developing  \\n and testing the right scenarios and have clear results too.  \\n Decision tables also help keep our process models simple.  \\n They can provide the details of a step in the process  \\n and help minimize all of the decision diamonds.  \\n I find decision tables very helpful in my requirements work.  \\n They're a great technique for generating meaningful dialogue  \\n about decisions and logic.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2414134\",\"duration\":237,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Data flow

- Have you ever had to enter your address three times  \\n when buying something online?  \\n You enter your address on a screen  \\n when you create your profile,  \\n or start a purchase,  \\n so, why doesn't it show up later in the process  \\n for shipping, billing, confirmation page,  \\n and receipt, right?  \\n In requirements, we refer to this as data flow.  \\n Our stakeholders and users often assume  \\n that data flows to the various processes,  \\n and don't explicitly ask for this flow  \\n when they talk about their requirements.  \\n Data flow analysis is a critical tool  \\n for generating high quality requirements.  \\n Without data flow analysis, customer satisfaction drops  \\n and defects rise.  \\n Users get frustrated when they don't see the data  \\n they expect and are asked to reenter data  \\n they've already provided.  \\n Defects also increase when the data needed  \\n for automated decisions is not where it needs to be.  \\n A data flow diagram provides a great visual  \\n of the processes and the data that flows through them.  \\n It provides a big picture  \\n for the team to discuss and understand their data needs.  \\n This is a view that other models just don't show well.  \\n Let's look at our online payments example,  \\n and think about the primary processes our customers  \\n and systems need to complete.  \\n We'll keep these pretty high level  \\n and place them in circles in the center of the page.  \\n For example, the customer needs to tell us  \\n how they want to pay, select payment type.  \\n They need to enter their payment information,  \\n enter payment details,  \\n and tell us how and where they want it shipped,  \\n select shipping options.  \\n The system needs to validate the payment,  \\n calculate the shipping costs, and confirm the order.  \\n Then, we need to identify the data stores  \\n that hold the data needed to support the processes.  \\n We add those data stores  \\n to the bottom of the diagram, like this.  \\n Now, the most important and valuable part  \\n of the data flow diagram, the arrows.  \\n We look at each circle or process  \\n and determine what chunks of data need to flow to  \\n and from the process to the customer and the data stores.  \\n Let's look at the process to select payment type.  \\n What data does the customer need to provide  \\n to complete this process?  \\n The customer needs to select the payment type  \\n and that payment type needs to be stored  \\n in the customer payment information database.  \\n Why does the data need to be stored?  \\n Well, because the system will need to support the process  \\n to validate and authorize the payment.  \\n Let's fill in a few more arrows.  \\n When we get to the confirm order,  \\n we realize we need to get  \\n our customer order database involved.  \\n Our customer indicates they are ready to confirm the order.  \\n The order details are placed in the customer order database  \\n and the system sends the order summary to the customer.  \\n So, we're at the point where our data flow diagram  \\n includes everything we know.  \\n Is it complete?  \\n Well, probably not.  \\n A critical step in any diagramming process  \\n is collaborating with others  \\n and walking the diagram together.  \\n Facilitate the walkthrough  \\n by asking them questions like,  \\n where do we store the

- What is the status of my order?  \\n Status, or the state of something, is often a key part  \\n of the logic within many systems and processes.  \\n If status and timing are critical components of a solution,  \\n then state and sequence diagrams will boost the value  \\n of your requirements.  \\n Let's start with state diagrams.  \\n State diagrams show the different states  \\n something can take on.  \\n For example, your order online is in the cart,  \\n purchased, processing, shipped, or received.  \\n A state diagram shows all these states  \\n and what causes the state to change.  \\n Without understanding the states and how they change,  \\n your user experience will be compromised.  \\n Let's look at an example.  \\n This state diagram shows the various order statuses  \\n and what moves the order between the various states.  \\n This is critical in helping developers  \\n make sure that these events, data, and states happen  \\n in concert with the user actions and data flow.  \\n You can also create a state table to show the same analysis.  \\n It's a different visual to show the same thing,  \\n and it would look like this.  \\n Next, let's look at sequence diagrams.  \\n Sequence diagrams show the interaction between people  \\n and different parts of a system.  \\n It shows the messages that get sent  \\n between the parties over time.  \\n Sequence diagrams help teams build a shared understanding  \\n of how various messages flow between people and systems,  \\n and when responses are expected.  \\n This is important so that the team can see and discuss  \\n the interactions expected between various users and systems,  \\n and when they work alone and together.  \\n Let's look at an example.  \\n In this example, we can see where the user interacts  \\n with a user interface, and where the user interface  \\n takes the information further for processing  \\n that does not involve the user.  \\n Sequence diagrams can be at the business level  \\n or at a very technical level showing system level messages.  \\n Be sure to model what's needed for your intended audience.  \\n Sequence and state diagrams are a great part  \\n of a requirements analysis toolkit, and great for details  \\n that tend to get lost in translation with other models.  \\n We've stated the business level with these examples.  \\n and they can get very

 \\n Well, it can be if you know how to adapt your project  \\n and requirements approach.  \\n Many teams customize the package software more  \\n than what's truly beneficial.  \\n The users and organization need to adapt  \\n to the software process,  \\n rather than customize whenever possible.  \\n This will save the organization lots of pain and money  \\n in the future.  \\n When buying software, whether it's a package, cloud based,  \\n or any other pre-built solution,  \\n there are some key differences to consider  \\n when working with requirements.  \\n First, keep your requirements focused on the user  \\n and the activities they need to accomplish with the system.  \\n It doesn't serve the project to define technical  \\n and functional details  \\n of exactly how the user will perform the task,  \\n as the software is already built,  \\n and changing at that level is typically cost prohibitive.  \\n Even technical processes that use pre-built software  \\n need to be looked at from how it impacts the user.  \\n What's important is making sure  \\n that the software allows the users to perform  \\n their necessary activities.  \\n It's best from a cost perspective for the users to adapt  \\n to how the package has them perform the activity,  \\n rather than customizing it to how the user wants it to work.  \\n If the software purchased is altered  \\n and customized beyond configuration,  \\n the risk is it becomes more cost-effective  \\n to build it yourself.  \\n Many organizations that need customizations build  \\n extension services, rather than alter the code  \\n of the purchase software.  \\n Next, make sure to understand the business rules, logic,  \\n policies, and decisions  \\n you're looking for the system to perform.  \\n Then, make sure that the system allows you to configure  \\n and perform these rules with the needed data inputs.  \\n This is typically in the configuration part of a system  \\n where you're allowed to configure the inner rules  \\n of each step a user performs for an activity.  \\n Then consider how the purchase software defines  \\n and connects data.  \\n Prebuilt software has predefined data definitions,  \\n assumptions, and relationships, and in many cases,  \\n these differ from the buyer's data definitions,  \\n assumptions, and relationships.  \\n It's important to identify  \\n and understand these differences before implementation.  \\n This usually comes out when reports don't seem right,  \\n and later in the research,  \\n we find that the data means  \\n something different than we thought,  \\n and last, integrations.  \\n Integrations are critical to most purchase software,  \\n as organizations want systems to exchange data  \\n to and from the purchase software.  \\n It's important to define the business purpose  \\n of each integration,  \\n the process its supports, and the user impact  \\n with and without the integration.  \\n Once these are known,  \\n we have enough context to work on the details.  \\n The details typically include defining the data needed  \\n between the systems and the detailed data attributes.  \\n Take a look at the exercise file I've created  \\n for you to find more considerations for integrations.  \\n For many organizations, the balance is tipping  \\n towards buying software,  \\n rather than building it from the ground up.  \\n It can be a great cost saver if done right.  \\n Doing it right relies  \\n on the team's ability to help users adapt their needs  \\n and activities to a different look, feel,  \\n and sometimes a different process.  \\n Make sure your users, rules,  \\n data and integration needs are thought through,  \\n and you will likely see the promise realized  \\n of purchase software.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"4.

We ask Systems to make thousands of decisions every day.\\nGetting the decision logic correct in our requirements\\nis no easy task.\\nDecision Tables are a great way to organize\\nand display decision logic,\\nand I use them frequently for requirements analysis.\\nLet's take a look at our online coffee store case study\\nand use a payment example, and start thinking about\\nwhich parts of the online payment process\\nhas decision logic, things like if-then conditions\\nfor example.\\n\\nOne area that jumps out at me is shipping costs.\\nMost companies have several different conditions\\nthat must be met to determine the appropriate shipping costs\\nfor an order.\\nThey might offer free shipping for preferred customers,\\ndiscounted shipping for large orders,\\nor additional fees for next day shipping.\\nThese conditions, especially when combined,\\ngenerate dozens of decision paths\\nthat will make visual models sprawl across multiple pages,\\nmaking it very hard for your stakeholders to understand\\nand evaluate.\\n\\nIn many cases, decisions are better modeled\\nin a decision table.\\nLet's start with a shipping calculation example.\\nHere are the requirements written in a text format.\\nTo build a decision table, we start with defining the result\\nor the decision to be made, in the last column.\\nIn this case, the decision is not clear\\nfrom the text requirement, however, when we ask ourselves\\nwhat decision this logic supports, it becomes more obvious\\nthat the decision is to determine what costs\\nthe customer will pay for shipping.\\n\\nWhen considering this example, we need to analyze the text\\nfor the decisions and scenarios.\\nSo next, we analyze the text based rules\\nfor the conditions that contribute to making the decision\\nand add them as column headers on the table.\\nIn this case, we would end up with conditions such as,\\nare they a preferred customer, is the order over $50,\\nis it standard versus rush shipping?\\nIdeally, we want the conditions to be binary,\\na Yes/No condition, and the ideal table has between two\\nand four conditions.\\n\\nWith these boundaries, the table stays small and manageable.\\nIf you have more conditions, consider putting together\\nmultiple tables that build into one.\\nSo, now that we have the result and the conditions,\\nwe need to determine how many possible scenarios there are.\\nWhen the conditions are a yes or no,\\nthis calculation is easy.\\nIt's an exponent calculation.\\nSo for this one, three conditions with two options each,\\nis two raised to the third power or two cubed.\\n\\nWith this math, our decision table will have eight rows\\nor eight scenarios, and this shows the importance\\nof using binary Yes/No conditions\\nand keeping conditions limited.\\nIf not limited, the table gets very large\\nand hard to review and analyze.\\nOkay, so now we have the results, the conditions,\\nand the total number of scenarios.\\nNext, we extrapolate out the eight scenarios\\ninto the various combinations.\\n\\nNow we are ready to determine the decisions of this logic\\nand confirm them as a team, and this means completing\\nthe results column of the table.\\nI like having the table prepared to this point\\nand than reviewing with key stakeholders\\nto gain consensus on the results column values.\\nKeeping it collaborative like this, gets others involved.\\nMake sure to provide the framework of the table,\\nlike the conditions and results, and a few example rows\\ncompleted to get the group going.\\n\\nUsing a decision table helps us pause\\nto identify all of the scenarios,\\nand puts the logic into an easy to read,\\ndiscuss and review format.\\nDevelopers and testers also love having this guide,\\nto make sure their developing and testing\\nthe right scenarios and have clear results too.\\nDecision tables also help keep our process model simple.\\nThey can provide the details of a

the four things to consider\\nwhen working on requirements for buying\\nor implementing a package software.\\nKeep user goals front and center.\\nBusiness rules and logic,\\ndata definitions, and

the project to define\\ntechnical and functional details\\nof exactly how the user will perform the task,\\nas the software is already built,\\nand changing at that level is typically cost prohibitive.\\n\\nEven technical processes that use prebuilt software\\nneed to be looked at from how it impacts the user.\\nWhat's important is making sure that the software\\nallows the users to perform their necessary activities.\\nIt's best from a cost perspective\\nfor the users to adapt to how the package\\nhas them perform the activity\\nrather than customizing it to how the user\\nwants it to work.\\nIf the software purchased is altered\\nand customized beyond configuration,\\nthe risk is it becomes more cost effective\\nto build it yourself.\\n\\nMany organizations that need customizations\\nbuild extension services rather than\\nalter the code of the purchased software.\\nNext, make sure to understand the business rules,\\nlogic, policies, and decisions you're looking\\nfor the system to perform.\\nThen, make sure that the system allows you\\nto configure and perform these rules\\nwith the needed data inputs.\\nThis is typically in the configuration part of a system\\nwhere you're allowed to configure the inner rules\\nof each step a user performs for an activity.\\n\\nThen, consider how the purchased software\\ndefines and connects data.\\nPrebuilt software has predefined data definitions,\\nassumptions, and relationships.\\nAnd in many cases, these differ from\\nthe buyer's data definitions,\\nassumptions, and relationships.\\nIt's important to identify and understand\\nthese differences before implementation.\\nThis usually comes out when reports don't seem right,\\nand later in the research we find\\nthat the data means something different than we thought.\\n\\nAnd last, integrations.\\nIntegrations are critical to most purchased software\\nas organizations want systems to exchange data\\nto and from the purchased software.\\nIt's important to define the business purpose\\nof each integration, the process it supports,\\nand the user impact with and without the integration.\\nOnce these are known, we have enough context\\nto work on the details.\\nThe details typically include\\ndefining the data needed between the systems\\nand the detailed data attributes.\\n\\nTake a look at the Exercise File I've created for you\\nto find more considerations for integrations.\\nFor many organizations, the balance is tipping\\ntowards buying software rather than building it\\nfrom the ground up.\\nIt can be a great cost saver if done right.\\nDoing it right relies on the team's ability\\nto help users adapt their needs and activities\\nto a different look, feel,\\nand sometimes a different process.\\nMake sure your users,

 \\n To find out whether it's drift or variation,  \\n we take four random readings  \\n and see how spread out they are.  \\n If they're all very close,  \\n we know it's the calibration of the oven temperature,  \\n but if they're all over the place,  \\n the know the temperature control is failing.  \\n Also, this sample of four gives us  \\n a measure of what the average is,  \\n without being misled by the occasional blip,  \\n and if we take samples every hour, or every day,  \\n we can track whether the average is drifting.  \\n So the sample of four allows us  \\n to track both drift and variation,  \\n and we then put both of these on graphs  \\n so that we can see what the process is doing over time.  \\n And even better, not only does this tell us  \\n why we failed and what to do to fix it,  \\n but it also gives us warning of problems before we fail.  \\n If our oven is starting to drift out of calibration,  \\n the SPC graphs will tell us long before  \\n we can taste anything wrong with the turkey.  \\n So we'll never get to the embarrassing point  \\n where the Christmas dinner is a disaster,  \\n or something is sent to a customer that's wrong.  \\n Imagine if you tracked the time taken to serve customers,  \\n or the number of typos in reports.  \\n You'd know if things were getting worse,  \\n hopefully before there was a complaint.  \\n The key is that it has to be measurable  \\n in order to apply the statistics and draw the graphs.  \\n I think you can see that pass fail doesn't come close,  \\n because it's too late and it gives you no real understanding  \\n of what's actually happening in your process.  \\n So that's SPC, and of course the question is  \\n how can you apply it your part of the business?  \\n What are your key processes, and what are the indicators  \\n within those processes that you could measure,  \\n and that you could track on graphs over time?  \\n These could be things like cost, waste,  \\n hours taken, overall delivery lead time,  \\n percentage delivered on time, quality,  \\n accuracy, or customer satisfaction.  \\n It sounds like a bit of work, but please do try SPC.  \\n It's one of the best and most neglected  \\n process improvement techniques.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2267838\",\"duration\":214,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Setting action limits: Performance figures\",\"fileName\":\"365729_01_05_MM30_Limits_2020Q1\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"When is a machine or a department out of tolerance rather than just unlucky?

 \\n Then you need fewer  \\n before you know that something's changed.  \\n In fact, turning the question right around,  \\n how unlikely does something have to be  \\n before just one occurrence warrants an investigation?  \\n What is the warning level  \\n at which you should act and investigate?  \\n For example, have you noticed  \\n how your credit card sometimes gets stopped  \\n and you get a phone call  \\n if you buy something unusually large  \\n or several quite large things?  \\n The credit card people are doing exactly this calculation  \\n to prevent fraud, and personally I'm glad they are  \\n even though it can be a bit annoying at times.  \\n In your case, how many complaints would you have to have  \\n in one month for you to get into action and investigate?  \\n How much over budget would that department have to be?  \\n How many accidents or days off sick  \\n in that part of your business?  \\n How low would sales have to be in just one month  \\n for you to have to investigate?  \\n Basically, with anything you're measuring,  \\n what should be the trigger point?  \\n I think you can see how useful this would be to know  \\n and also that if you don't know it,  \\n then almost what's the point of measuring anything?  \\n So the formula for this action point  \\n is the mean plus or minus 3.14  \\n times the MMR  \\n where the MMR is the median moving range.  \\n Don't panic, I'll explain.  \\n Take this column of numbers.  \\n These are the numbers of accidents each month  \\n at a railway station.  \\n By the way, I don't mean train crashes.  \\n I just mean someone slipping over  \\n on a patch of spilled coffee or something like that.  \\n Every little thing gets recorded these days.  \\n Now, suppose I get these  \\n from a hundred different railway stations  \\n and I want a way to monitor them and tell me whether I need  \\n to investigate a particular station.  \\n Here's how I do the calculation.  \\n First, the mean is 7.9.  \\n I get this by adding up all the numbers  \\n and dividing by how many numbers there are.  \\n Next, I need the MMR, the median moving range.  \\n This is simpler than it sounds.  \\n I get this by working out the size of the change  \\n from one number to the next,  \\n always written as a positive number,  \\n whether it's going up or down.  \\n And I put them in between the numbers like this.  \\n Next, you sort them into order and take the middle one,  \\n which you can see is a four.  \\n You can imagine how this will be easy with a spreadsheet  \\n or getting it done automatically via computer.  \\n This middle number is your median moving range, or MMR.  \\n What it really is is the typical amount  \\n that the number changes by from one day to the next.  \\n It's a measure of how spiky the data is.  \\n You can see that if this is small,  \\n then any reasonable change to the number  \\n of accidents is going to be significant,  \\n while if the MMR is large,  \\n then you're going to need a huge change  \\n in the number of accidents before I panic.  \\n So finally, the formula tells us  \\n that the action point is 3.14 MMRs above the mean.  \\n In my example, the MMR is four,  \\n so the action point is 3.14 times four,  \\n which is about 12 1/2 above the mean.  \\n So that's the mean of 7.9 plus 12 1/2,  \\n which is about 20 1/2.  \\n So if I hear of 21 accidents or more,  \\n then I need to investigate.  \\n Any fewer than 20, say 17 accidents in one month,  \\n it's just random variation  \\n unless it happens eight times in a row.  \\n And that's how you work it out.  \\n You get the gaps.  \\n You find the middle-sized one, the MMR.  \\n You multiply it by 3.14, and you add it to the mean.  \\n You could use this method  \\n to monitor anything that you want to keep an eye on,  \\n sales, costs, mistakes, lead times, temperatures,  \\n amount of scrap or rework, complaints, et cetera.  \\n And clearly the action limit would be above the mean  \\n if it's a problem that you're looking out for  \\n and you don't want it to go above a certain limit,  \\n while it would be below the mean  \\n if you were measuring something desirable  \\n like sales or production output  \\n and you don't want it to drop below a lower limit.  \\n That's why the formula  \\n is the mean plus or minus 3.14 times the MMR.  \\n So the question is what could you try this on?  \\n What do you measure or could you measure  \\n where an action limit would be useful to have?  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

 \\n At first sight, you would think yes, wouldn't you?  \\n Well, there are two parts to the cost of quality,  \\n the first one being what's known as prevention cost.  \\n And this does increase as you increase your quality.  \\n This is the cost of making sure things are done well,  \\n so it includes things like training,  \\n having quality control systems and good management,  \\n having great equipment and materials,  \\n and employing good people.  \\n It gets very expensive to make everything perfectly.  \\n In fact, it increases exponentially,  \\n becoming infinite when you approach perfection.  \\n The other cost of quality is the failure cost.  \\n Now, this increases as your quality decreases.  \\n As you become more and more rubbish,  \\n you have to pay more to scrap things,  \\n rework things, handle complaints from customers,  \\n lose contracts, maybe even get sued.  \\n You can see that using cheap materials, cheap equipment,  \\n and employing the cheapest people  \\n or paying your people badly  \\n is actually going to have a cost.  \\n The question is whether it costs you more than you save,  \\n and that's where we can combine  \\n these two graphs to get the total cost.  \\n As you can see, on the right the failure cost  \\n has dwindled to almost zero,  \\n so the total cost is pretty much just the prevention cost.  \\n And similarly, on the left we've become so bad  \\n that we were doing pretty much no prevention,  \\n and the only cost is the failure cost, which is high.  \\n And in the middle, where the two graphs cross,  \\n our failure cost is the same as our prevention cost,  \\n and the total is double each of these.  \\n So the total cost is U-shaped,  \\n with the point of minimum cost being in the middle.  \\n This is the cheapest place to be.  \\n I'll explain in a moment  \\n why you don't actually want to be there.  \\n But just to say that most organizations  \\n don't realize that this is the cheapest point,  \\n because they don't measure their failure costs.  \\n They are painfully aware of their prevention costs,  \\n the cost of training, the cost of quality control,  \\n the cost of upmarket materials and precise machinery.  \\n And there's always pressure to reduce all these costs.  \\n These costs have budgets which are monitored  \\n and cut slightly every year, et cetera.  \\n So there's always pressure to reduce quality  \\n in order to save money.  \\n But they forget the invisible failure costs.  \\n There's no budget for doing things twice  \\n or handling complaints.  \\n The cost of lost customers or wasted staff time  \\n isn't measured as a separate thing.  \\n So why wouldn't we want to be right in the middle,  \\n at this point of minimum cost?  \\n The answer is because it's not the point of maximum profit.  \\n This is because if you move from five to about seven,  \\n your costs only go up a little bit,  \\n because each increase in prevention  \\n is largely outweighed by saving in failure costs.  \\n And yet you can charge more,  \\n or sell more at the same price, so your profit will go up.  \\n If your sales volume or price  \\n looks like this extra line I've added,  \\n you can see that the point of maximum profit,  \\n and profit is sales minus costs,  \\n is to the right of the middle.  \\n This is where you and your organization should be.  \\n So there are four important learning points from all this.  \\n Number one, choosing low quality  \\n on anything is a false economy.  \\n Number two is the point of minimum costs  \\n is not the best place to be.  \\n It's not where the maximum profit is.  \\n Thirdly, the point of maximum profit is at about seven.  \\n So how can you get there?  \\n And fourthly, trying to achieve a quality of 10  \\n will cost you more than you make from it.  \\n It's not worth trying to reach 10.  \\n Now, a final thought is how can we actually  \\n make this graph for real?  \\n How can we really know where we are on it?  \\n It's a good theory, but how do you apply it to real life?  \\n Well, I think the answer is that you start by listing  \\n and estimating your prevention costs,  \\n and perhaps even more importantly, your failure costs.  \\n You can then start to think about  \\n whether investing in better quality,  \\n whether it's people or equipment or materials or methods,  \\n would pay for itself.  \\n If your failure costs are greater  \\n than your prevention costs,  \\n then you definitely have a problem.  \\n If your prevention and failure costs are roughly equal,  \\n then you know you're at the point of lowest costs,  \\n which isn't bad, but ideally you'd move up from there  \\n towards higher quality a bit.  \\n If your prevention costs are roughly  \\n double your failure costs, then you're spot-on.  \\n That's the point to be aiming for.  \\n So I'd like you to think about  \\n how you'll measure your failure costs.  \\n What are the things that are costing you money,  \\n and how much, roughly, do you think they're costing?

 \\n In fact, in your working day,  \\n how much of your time is productive?  \\n Time is important because your biggest cost  \\n might well be your people, which is effectively their time.  \\n And then, what proportion of materials are thrown away?  \\n And what's that costing you per year?  \\n Expensive resources like machinery,  \\n laboratories and even office space.  \\n What is their utilization?  \\n Are they used all the time,  \\n with no space wasted on piles of stuff  \\n that hasn't moved for weeks?  \\n There's a Japanese theory about waste,  \\n which says that there are seven types.  \\n Although I personally like a way to remember them  \\n that spells out the word downtime and adds an eighth one.  \\n And here it is.  \\n The D of downtime is for defects,  \\n which cost you money even if you find out immediately.  \\n The O of downtime stands for overproduction,  \\n making more than you need,  \\n maybe cause you make things in large batches or for stock,  \\n which then have to be stored and checked  \\n and which tie up your capital.  \\n The W of downtime stands for waiting,  \\n which means the time the product spends waiting,  \\n rather than the time that people spend waiting.  \\n This could be half-finished product,  \\n waiting while a machine is set up  \\n or while other parts in the batch are worked on  \\n or waiting while a broken machine gets repaired.  \\n It's what makes the difference between the small  \\n amount of time it takes to make that product  \\n and the full lead time that the customer  \\n has to wait for it.  \\n And remember, this isn't just about manufacturing.  \\n The service might be you waiting to get the keys  \\n for your car at the hire car desk,  \\n the keys are the product that you're waiting for.  \\n And how much time did they spend waiting  \\n to be given to you?  \\n The N of downtime stands for non-used employee talent.  \\n This is the extra one that takes us from seven  \\n to eight, by the way and isn't it a good one?  \\n Every person who works for you, that has talent  \\n that the organization hasn't tapped into,  \\n is a wasted resource.  \\n This could be the biggest waste in most organizations.  \\n I bet you know people, hopefully not you,  \\n who coast through their working day,  \\n not really engaged with their job because the company's  \\n failed to excite them and yet,  \\n in their personal life, they coach the football team  \\n or do any number of really impressive things.  \\n And that's because they have that spare energy  \\n and potential that work isn't making use of.  \\n The T of downtime stands for transportation.  \\n This is any movement of components or paper  \\n or equipment around the site and which can really add up  \\n if you were to follow a job from it's start  \\n to it's final dispatch.  \\n The I of downtime stands for inventory,  \\n which is raw materials, work in progress  \\n or finished materials ready for shipment  \\n and which means that you've got money tied up in it  \\n as well as the cost of storing it and looking after it.  \\n The M stands for motion,  \\n which is not the same as transportation.  \\n It means wear and tear on machines and on people  \\n and it comes with risk of accidents and damage.  \\n And finally, the E of downtime stands for  \\n excessive processing, which includes over-design,  \\n making things too good or doing operations  \\n to a part of the product or service that the customer  \\n won't see or care about.  \\n Clearly, it's worth making sure that you minimize  \\n all of these and a good start would be to look  \\n at every stage of your processes with these in mind.  \\n Finally, on the subject of waste,  \\n there's a nice little idea called Poka-Yoke,  \\n which means foolproofing of design in Japanese.  \\n You design things so that it's impossible to get them wrong,  \\n like the way the diesel filling nozzle for your car  \\n is too big to go into a petrol filler hole,  \\n so you can't put diesel in by mistake.  \\n And Poka-Yoke is not just product design but systems too.  \\n Ideally, you set up all systems so that it's  \\n actually impossible for people to do them wrongly.  \\n For example, I often leave my memory stick behind  \\n in people's computers but recently,  \\n I've put it on my car keys so that now,  \\n I physically can't drive away leaving my memory stick behind  \\n however senile I become.  \\n So I'd just like you to think about the commonest mistake  \\n that gets made in your area of work  \\n and how could you design something in  \\n so that it can't happen, it physically can't.  \\n And then, going back to the areas of waste  \\n I mentioned earlier just now, with downtime,  \\n what are your main areas of waste  \\n and what can you do to reduce them?

- Of quality, cost, and time,  \\n it's often time that gets forgotten.  \\n We know that quality needs to be high,  \\n and customers remind us of that if it isn't,  \\n and we know that costs have to be low,  \\n but time as in lead time, often gets forgotten.  \\n And if we need things quicker, it's often assumed  \\n that we just have to work harder or something.  \\n But there's actually a whole lot of interesting science  \\n and theories behind lead time,  \\n and that's what I want to go into with you now.  \\n By the way, the simplest way  \\n to be able to deliver product quickly  \\n is to keep them in stock.  \\n It doesn't matter how long it takes to make them  \\n if you keep some in stock does it?  \\n Although in a way, yes it does,  \\n because stock is almost always a bad idea.  \\n It costs money for the space to store it,  \\n it goes out of date, it gets damaged  \\n or pilfered, it needs managing and checking,  \\n it's capital tied up,  \\n and it allows you to get away with being less  \\n and less efficient in your manufacturing.  \\n Keeping stock reduces your ability  \\n to be flexible and to make exactly what each customer wants.  \\n It necessitates accurate forecasting  \\n of future demand, which might be impossible.  \\n And when you don't have the item in stock,  \\n you're really stuck.  \\n So there are lots of hidden costs to keeping stock  \\n which people often don't take into account.  \\n And of course services can't be kept in stock.  \\n Everything from hot pizzas to heart transplants  \\n can't be kept on the shelf, they have to be produced  \\n with ideally the minimum waiting time.  \\n So for anything you currently keep in stock,  \\n a good question to ask yourself is,  \\n \\\"Am I sure we can't make this to order  \\n \\\"if we really wanted to?\\\"  \\n It might cost a bit more,  \\n but actually we'd probably save money as well  \\n by not having it in stock.  \\n But whether you're making for stock,  \\n or whether you're making for customers,  \\n the next question is,  \\n \\\"How can make it in a shorter lead time?\\\"  \\n Why does it take so long to make things?  \\n I used to work in a helicopter factory,  \\n and it took three years to make a gear wheel  \\n for a helicopter gear box,  \\n and yet there was only two weeks of actual metal cutting.  \\n The rest of the time was all transporting stuff  \\n around the factory, and waiting to start the batch,  \\n often there were 10 other batches also waiting  \\n for that machine.  \\n And then waiting for the rest of your big batch,  \\n some batches were 500 parts,  \\n before finally your part gets made.  \\n If you were to follow the piece of metal,  \\n you'll find that they have four main activities.  \\n The first one is transferring from one part of the process  \\n to the next.  \\n Then there's waiting in the queue  \\n to be operated upon.  \\n Then there's waiting while the rest of the batch  \\n are operated on.  \\n And then finally, the only value added activity in all this,  \\n being operated on themselves.  \\n By the way, the same principles apply  \\n to an office environment,  \\n so this could be the time  \\n from getting a planning application in  \\n to finally being able to say yes or no  \\n to the new building.  \\n It could be the time it takes  \\n to get from arriving at the airport  \\n to getting onto your plane,  \\n or the time it takes to get your car serviced,  \\n or the time it takes to get your pizza  \\n in a restaurant,  \\n or the time it takes to produce a training course  \\n like this one, these are all lead times.  \\n Now queues happen in the form of piles of paper  \\n on people's desks, and in their email inboxes,  \\n and in the form of waiting lists.  \\n A six month waiting list for a doctor  \\n is really a six month queue of people.  \\n So the three ways to get things through quicker  \\n are number one, having a better layout  \\n so that you can move things from one machine,  \\n or person, or department to the next more quickly.  \\n There's probably not much savings there,  \\n but it's worth thinking about,  \\n especially if you're making something big like cars.  \\n The second method would be reducing the queues  \\n at each operation,  \\n which could be done by having plenty of capacity,  \\n although that's expensive,  \\n or maybe by being very clever about how you schedule things  \\n through the system,  \\n so that you make things in the best order  \\n and queues don't build up.  \\n Or you could do it by simplifying the problem,  \\n by focusing only on the bottleneck  \\n or by using pull systems,  \\n both of which I'll come to later on in the course.  \\n And the third way would be reducing the batch waiting time  \\n by making smaller batches.  \\n

- The first thing we want to look at  \\n when you want to streamline any process is,  \\n can we reduce the number of steps?  \\n And this is part of something called  \\n Business Process Reengineering, or BPR.  \\n Which really just consists of  \\n looking at the way we do things,  \\n ideally drawing the processes out as a flow diagram,  \\n and then asking the following four questions.  \\n Number one, can any steps be just deleted?  \\n You might be surprised at how many steps there are  \\n in your process, forms filled in,  \\n data put into computers, work allocated to people,  \\n quality checked by supervisors, etc, etc.  \\n Does the supervisor really have to check it?  \\n Can the manager type in their own data?  \\n Do we need to print out that order form?  \\n The second thing to do with BPR is to ask yourself,  \\n can any steps be automated by a computer?  \\n This is almost as good as getting rid of them.  \\n So it could be worth drawing out the whole process,  \\n and then asking the question  \\n from one or more technical types  \\n who know what can be computerized.  \\n Part three of BPR is can any steps be combined into one  \\n and done by one person instead of two?  \\n Can the person who receives the phone call  \\n also be the one who sorts out the problem?  \\n Can the designer also be the buyer  \\n of the parts they've designed?  \\n Can the machine operator also do the packing of their work?  \\n I'm amazed that there are still lawyers out there  \\n who dictate emails to their secretaries.  \\n You might be able to think of examples in your systems  \\n where stages could be combined,  \\n thus cutting out one transfer and one queue.  \\n Even if person two is much quicker at doing your job,  \\n it would still probably be faster for person one  \\n to do it all, then having to wait for person two  \\n to get around to yours.  \\n And the fourth part of BPR is,  \\n can any steps be done in parallel  \\n rather than one after another?  \\n So reducing the number of steps,  \\n or doing some of them in parallel  \\n is the first way to get something through more quickly.  \\n And it also often has the benefit of saving you money, too,  \\n if you get rid of unnecessary steps or can automate them.  \\n In some manufacturing companies,  \\n this has been taken to the extreme of  \\n what are known as production cells.  \\n Volvo did a famous experiment where a team of people  \\n made the whole car from start to finish,  \\n instead of a conventional flow line  \\n where you just put on the wheels and pass it on.  \\n And although they were a bit slower  \\n at doing the whole assembly  \\n than specialists would have been,  \\n they saved on transfer and waiting time.  \\n The car was being worked on the whole time.  \\n And also, the team really cared about that car.  \\n So quality was improved.  \\n So, in the idea of a production cell,  \\n a small group of people,  \\n often sitting or standing in a U shape,  \\n and by the way, they're on the inside the U of tables,  \\n so they can swap around and help each other,  \\n they process a job from the start to the finish.  \\n So they get to be a team, and the job gets work done  \\n more or less without touching the ground,  \\n and comes out the other end really quickly.  \\n So you might want to think about setting up some cells,  \\n particularly if you have families of similar items  \\n that have to be assembled by groups of people.  \\n A final thought is that the office example of a cell  \\n is a meeting.  \\n Whilst it's not always brilliantly efficient  \\n for each individual person,  \\n we sometimes have to sit through an agenda item  \\n which doesn't affect us,  \\n or our input is only very brief.  \\n But it's very efficient for the task under consideration,  \\n because instead of being passed  \\n from one desk to the next for weeks,  \\n it gets put on the table, and dealt with  \\n by everyone in a few minutes, job done.  \\n So there's the same trade off between individual efficiency  \\n and getting jobs processed within a short lead time.  \\n So it would certainly be a good idea  \\n to draw out your processes and review them.  \\n Can any steps be removed, computerized,  \\n combined into one, or done in parallel?  \\n And, maybe, some of your processes would benefit  \\n from being made into their own separate production cell.  \\n

3 seconds to cut you off a nice piece,  \\n and then it takes 20 seconds to get your vegetables,  \\n and then 15 and 10 seconds for one server  \\n to give you both your dessert and your drink,  \\n and then it takes a minute to pay for it all.  \\n Have a look at the diagram for a moment,  \\n and then see if you can tell me,  \\n how many lunches this setup can serve per hour?  \\n Now people often find this a difficult question,  \\n and they get bogged down with a calculator  \\n working out lots of sums, but actually,  \\n this question illustrates  \\n a really important and simple idea.  \\n What's the bottleneck of the system?  \\n The cashier is the slowest part,  \\n and can only process 60 people per hour.  \\n So whatever the others do,  \\n that's the number of people you're going to be able to serve.  \\n It's simple.  \\n So what's the bottleneck for your work?  \\n If you were the manager,  \\n what could you do to improve the above setup,  \\n without spending any money on equipment or extra people?  \\n By the way, self-service is not allowed,  \\n you must maintain portion control.  \\n Again, it looks hard, but if you focus on the bottleneck,  \\n then the answer is clear.  \\n There's no point in doing anything faster  \\n than the bottleneck.  \\n It's a waste of capacity.  \\n So get rid of anything faster than the bottleneck.  \\n This means you can redeploy two of the people  \\n and run it with just three.  \\n They can still serve all the food  \\n within the rate of one person a minute,  \\n which is the speed they're going through the cashier.  \\n But, of course, if you have more demand  \\n than one person per minute,  \\n it would be better to serve the extra customers,  \\n and this means speeding up the bottleneck.  \\n So let's suppose that you could have two cashiers.  \\n How many people could you serve per hour now?  \\n And the answer is easy.  \\n You could now put a person through every 30 seconds,  \\n which is 120 people per hour.  \\n For just the cost of the one extra cashier,  \\n you're selling an extra 60 lunches.  \\n If meals cost, say $10, that's another $600 you're getting.  \\n This illustrates the principle  \\n that working on the bottleneck is really valuable  \\n since it frees up the whole system.  \\n I wonder how you could apply that concept.  \\n Now one final question.  \\n Going back to our original setup,  \\n how long will it take you to get your lunch?  \\n This looks easy, but it's actually a really hard question.  \\n See if you can come up with the answer.  \\n Please

\\n What about everyone else?  \\n It's not the same for them.  \\n So the second way to look at the problem  \\n is to imagine a conveyor belt.  \\n Everyone moves along once per minute.  \\n This is what happens when your trays  \\n are all sliding along on some rails.  \\n It takes you 20 seconds to get your soup,  \\n but you have to wait a whole minute  \\n before you can move along to the meat,  \\n because all the trays are waiting  \\n for the cashier to hurry up and serve their person.  \\n That's a total of five minutes to get your lunch.  \\n Now the third way of thinking about this problem  \\n of how long it will take to get your lunch  \\n is to ask, but what if there were islands?  \\n What if you can go to the soup island,  \\n have some soup, and then go over to the meat island, etc.,  \\n finally ending up at the cashier,  \\n who also has their own island.  \\n This is important because it's just the same  \\n as different offices or departments,  \\n with jobs flowing between them.  \\n And just look what happens.  \\n It takes 20 seconds to get your soup,  \\n so three people per minute are getting soup.  \\n And then they're going over to the meat island.  \\n Now, only two people per minute  \\n are being served at the meat island  \\n because it takes 30 seconds to do the meat.  \\n So the queue at the meat island gets longer  \\n at a rate of one person per minute.  \\n And they arrive at the cashier at two per minute.  \\n And then, only one per minute gets served by the cashier.  \\n So the queue gets longer at the cashier as well.  \\n After 10 minutes, you've got 10 people queuing  \\n at the meat island, which means five minutes  \\n of waiting time to get their meat,  \\n and you've got 10 people also queuing at the cashier,  \\n which means waiting here another 10 minutes,  \\n which is 15 minutes waiting in total,  \\n plus the serving times.  \\n This is exactly the same as jobs piling up  \\n in the accounts department or people queuing  \\n for airport security.  \\n The queues can get really long.  \\n So islands are good if some people want  \\n to miss out the meat or the vegetables,  \\n but they can lead to uncontrolled queues and delays,  \\n while the conveyor belt forces  \\n the slowest point to hurry up.  \\n Everyone's looking at the slowest point,  \\n in this example, the cashier.  \\n And in a work context, management,  \\n or maybe the people who are being held up,  \\n could go and help out.  \\n So the three main conclusions  \\n from this example are number one,  \\n you can easily work out how much the system can deliver  \\n by just looking at the bottleneck,  \\n in this case, the cashier.  \\n Number two, the bottleneck limits the throughput.  \\n So either you plan everything to go at that speed,  \\n or you speed up the bottleneck.  \\n And if you spend a little more on the bottleneck,  \\n you can get a lot more from the whole system.  \\n In our case, it only costed maybe an extra $10 an hour  \\n for a second cashier,  \\n but we served an extra 60 meals which gained us $600.  \\n It pays to look after that bottleneck.  \\n And thirdly, finally, the time spent in the system.  \\n It's just as important to think about  \\n as the quantity coming through.  \\n You don't want your lunch to be cold  \\n by the time you pay for it.  \\n And similarly, in an organization,  \\n you don't want to have lost your customer,  \\n by the time you quote a price  \\n or deliver a product or service.  \\n So as usual I'd like you to ask yourself  \\n whether you have balanced flow through your processes,  \\n whether you have an obvious bottleneck,  \\n where the queues of stuff either physical or jobs  \\n in people's inboxes, sometimes build up.  \\n And whether the throughput time  \\n might be too long in some of your processes.  \\n

In the lunch line example in the previous section,  \\n we saw how the cashier was the bottleneck  \\n and that spotting that fact  \\n and then improving the cashier's throughput  \\n made all the difference.  \\n This idea of bottlenecks first appeared in the 1980s  \\n when a book called \\\"The Goal\\\" came out.  \\n It was written by Eli Goldratt  \\n and it blew everyone's minds, including mine.  \\n His first point is that you can't make more  \\n than the bottleneck can handle.  \\n So if you know the bottleneck,  \\n you know how much you can produce,  \\n whatever else is going on in your factory or office.  \\n And therefore, if you can increase the capacity  \\n of the bottleneck, you can increase the capacity  \\n of the whole system.  \\n So spending money on the bottleneck is really worth doing,  \\n while spending money on non-bottleneck areas  \\n is a complete waste.  \\n Lots of subtle ideas flow from this bottleneck idea,  \\n and here are three.  \\n Firstly, there's no point in pushing in more  \\n than the bottleneck can handle into your system.  \\n Otherwise, work or people will just pile up  \\n inside your system.  \\n You can use this knowledge  \\n to schedule the input of work or materials.  \\n You can also use it to schedule  \\n what's going to come out of the system.  \\n If the bottleneck is processing 10 per day,  \\n then you know that 10 per day  \\n will becoming out of the whole system a bit later.  \\n There can't be more than 10 coming out,  \\n and there won't be less either.  \\n If there's a temporary delay downstream,  \\n then you can catch up the day after  \\n and get back to the average of 10.  \\n The second concept that comes out of bottlenecks  \\n is that time lost at non-bottlenecks isn't really lost  \\n because they can catch up  \\n as long as they don't affect the bottleneck itself.  \\n So ideally, you'd have a buffer of work  \\n in front of the bottleneck  \\n so that it never runs out of work to do.  \\n Then, any problems upstream don't matter  \\n as it keeps working on its buffer,  \\n and problems downstream similarly don't matter.  \\n So you'd focus your management effort  \\n on making sure that the bottleneck never breaks down,  \\n never runs out of things to work on,  \\n and is never supplied with any parts or materials  \\n that are already defective.  \\n The third important concept  \\n that comes out of bottleneck theory  \\n is avoid having any operations  \\n that are resourced significantly higher than the bottleneck  \\n because this is just waste.  \\n What they make will never get through the bottleneck.  \\n But similarly, don't reduce them down  \\n to exactly the same as the bottleneck,  \\n otherwise, you've got two.  \\n And if you get rid of the bottleneck,  \\n then you'll have to look for  \\n the next lowest production area.  \\n There will always be a bottleneck in any system.  \\n What's yours?  \\n But how to find your bottleneck?  \\n Well, there are three ways.  \\n First, calculate the hours required at each stage  \\n to cope with the total throughput  \\n and see if you have enough capacity at each stage.  \\n For example, if it takes one minute  \\n to put the wheels on the car and we make 600 cars a day,  \\n do we have 600 minutes, that's 10 hours,  \\n of people available at the wheel putting-on stage?  \\n And the second way to find your bottleneck,  \\n a much simpler way, is to look for where the queues are.  \\n If there's a queue for the photocopier,  \\n then that might be the bottleneck for your office.  \\n Or if the booking-in clerk  \\n has a pile of paper on their desk,  \\n they might be your bottleneck.  \\n And of course it's criminal  \\n if one of your cheapest resources  \\n is, in fact, strangling the output of the whole operation.  \\n The third way to find the bottleneck  \\n is that, when you've got multiple products  \\n and multiple paths through the system,  \\n look at what tends to be late  \\n and then find out where those items are getting held up,  \\n and this is probably going to be your bottleneck.  \\n Then you can do the calculation I mentioned above  \\n to check whether you have the required capacity.  \\n Then finally, what can you do about your bottleneck?  \\n Well, the main thing is to look after it.  \\n Put your best people on it,  \\n measure any downtime and reduce it,  \\n keep a buffer of work in front of it,  \\n and consider investing in a second bit of equipment  \\n or another person, and remembering that the cost is worth it  \\n if it gets you extra output from the whole system.  \\n Imagine if fitting four more wheels and hour  \\n means you can make and sell a whole extra car per hour.  \\n So, what's the bottleneck in your office  \\n or department or factory,  \\n and how can you get more stuff through it?  \\n

 \\n What happens then?  \\n Here's an example.  \\n Clearly, if you can serve 10 people in an hour  \\n and you've got 12 people an hour arriving,  \\n then the queue is going to get longer and longer  \\n by an average of two people per hour.  \\n After 20 hours, the queue will be 40 people  \\n and you don't want that.  \\n But what if you can serve 10 people in an hour  \\n and you only have eight people arriving?  \\n Surely that's going to be fine, isn't it?  \\n I want to show you that actually it isn't.  \\n Well, this is because the eight people  \\n won't arrive evenly spaced.  \\n So you'll get several at once, which is a queue,  \\n and then you'll have a gap.  \\n And during this gap, after you've got rid of the queue,  \\n you're not serving anyone, so you're losing capacity,  \\n and your ability to serve 10 people per hour  \\n is reducing to maybe only seven.  \\n So problem number one is fluctuating arrival rates.  \\n You will also have fluctuating service rates  \\n because sometimes it will only take four or five minutes  \\n to serve somebody, while sometimes it will take seven  \\n or eight minutes to serve them.  \\n So the seven-minute people reduce your overall output.  \\n And then when you get a person who needs only five minutes,  \\n after them, you'll have a gap when you're wasting capacity.  \\n Your employee's just sitting around.  \\n So when you're planning the amount of capacity we need  \\n in order to give a good service to our customers,  \\n we can't just work out the number per hour on average.  \\n It won't be enough.  \\n We need to think about how much spare capacity  \\n we need to have in order to cope with these fluctuations  \\n in arrival and service rates.  \\n Luckily, there's a really neat little formula,  \\n which tells us how much extra capacity we need.  \\n The formula tells us that the queue length equals  \\n the utilization divided by one minus the utilization.  \\n And if we're using percentages for the utilization,  \\n so we're saying 75% of the time they're working  \\n instead of they're three-quarters utilized,  \\n the formula which predicts the queue length will be  \\n the utilization divided by 100 minus the utilization.  \\n Now, don't panic, it's only maths.  \\n You'll see that this formula is very easy to use  \\n and it's completely brilliant and it's an amazing thing  \\n because it applies to everything in the world  \\n or least every situation where work is arriving  \\n at a random rate and you still need to serve  \\n the customer reasonably quickly,  \\n which is pretty much every situation.  \\n Let's take the example of an IT help desk  \\n customer service line, where it takes  \\n seven and a half minutes to deal with the call.  \\n So on average, you should be able to serve  \\n eight people an hour.  \\n And say you have 64 calls an hour coming in,  \\n so that would mean, on the face of it,  \\n you would expect to need eight people in your system  \\n in order to cope with the demand.  \\n But as we've already seen,  \\n there will be times when you're wasting capacity  \\n 'cause there isn't any demand,  \\n so you actually won't serve eight per hour.  \\n But on average, you do have 64 per hour arriving,  \\n so the queue in this situation is going to get longer  \\n and longer and longer.  \\n We need some spare capacity  \\n in order to keep the queues down, but how much?  \\n Suppose you have 10 people instead of the original eight  \\n that we thought was enough.  \\n Will that be enough?  \\n Well, let's look at the formula.  \\n First, we need to know our utilization.  \\n Well, we've got 10 people doing the work of eight,  \\n so our 10 people are only going to be 80% utilized.  \\n The formula tells us that the queue length  \\n will then be U divided by 100 minus U,  \\n which is 80 divided by 100 minus 80, which is 20.  \\n So 80 divided by 20, which equals a queue of four.  \\n And since we know it's taking about seven minutes  \\n to serve somebody, then the queue of four  \\n means that you'll be waiting 28 minutes  \\n and that's probably too long.  \\n Now, suppose we still have 64 calls coming in per hour  \\n and we have 10 people and then one of them leaves,  \\n and the ambitious manager thinks,  \\n \\\"Well, we did it with 10 staff  \\n \\\"and they had 20% of their time wasted,  \\n \\\"so let's just leave it at nine people  \\n \\\"and get them to work a bit harder and save some money.\\\"  \\n What happens to our system?  \\n Well, utilization is now about 90% instead of 80%  \\n and the formula then tells us  \\n that the queue lengths will be 90 divided by 10,  \\n which equals nine, nine people in the queue.  \\n So it's seven minutes per call.  \\n You're going to be waiting 63 minutes, over an hour.  \\n So the small saving in cost that this manager has made  \\n has resulted in much worse service.  \\n The queue length has been doubled  \\n and is now unacceptably long.  \\n So how many people serving would we need  \\n in order to get the queuing time down to almost nothing?  \\n Well, we know that 80% gives you 80 over 20,  \\n which is a queue of four.  \\n 75% utilization gives you 75 over 25,  \\n which is a queue of three.  \\n 67% utilization gives you a queue of two  \\n and 50% gives you 50 over 100 minus 50,  \\n which is 50 over 50, which is a queue of one.  \\n And by the way, that one is you being served.  \\n So in order to give instant service,  \\n you need double the resource you would expect.  \\n So managers want utilization to be 80% or higher  \\n 'cause they don't want to be wasting lots of cost,  \\n but customers want queues to be only one or two.  \\n And you can see on the chart that these don't overlap.  \\n Either the customer has to pay more  \\n for the luxury of more staff  \\n or they have to live with queues resulting from fewer staff.  \\n And managers have to choose between wasting resources  \\n in order to give great service and charging for that,  \\n or they need to live with unhappy customers  \\n while they keep their cost down.  \\n This is a law of nature  \\n and the big message is that you mustn't just calculate  \\n how much capacity you'll need based on 100% performance.  \\n You must do this and then add between 20% and 100%,  \\n depending on the speed of service  \\n you want to give your customers  \\n and charge them accordingly for that.  \\n Process improvement doesn't just mean  \\n cutting your resources to the bone  \\n because that will have the collateral effect  \\n of making your service times much worse.  \\n So I want you to think about this for your own processes.  \\n Where do you have variable arrival rates?  \\n Where do you have queues?  \\n And should you increase your capacity  \\n in order to reduce those queues?  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2270624\",\"duration\":278,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Reducing lead time using a pull approach to reduce buffers\",\"fileName\":\"365729_02_10_MM30_Pull_2020Q1\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Queues are inevitable.

- What is a pull system and how can you use one?  \\n Well the basic idea is that you don't produce any work  \\n that the next person in the chain can't cope with.  \\n Buying food from a supermarket,  \\n or ordering books from the internet  \\n are both pull systems,  \\n because you buy more at the rate that suits you.  \\n Imagine if the supermarket  \\n automatically delivered food at a fixed rate,  \\n regardless of whether you wanted more,  \\n but this is exactly what happens with your e-mail inbox,  \\n and with the post, and with most factories,  \\n where the job is done and passed to the next department,  \\n regardless of whether they're going slowly,  \\n or are ill, or are on holiday.  \\n So the idea of a pull system  \\n is that you stop the upstream person from making the work,  \\n unless the downstream person can cope with it.  \\n Two easy ways to do this are as follows.  \\n The first is to have an ordering system,  \\n like we do with the supermarket.  \\n The second person sends a message to the first person,  \\n saying, \\\"Make more,\\\" or \\\"Deliver more.\\\"  \\n Sometimes this message is in the form of a little card,  \\n sometimes known as a Kanban card,  \\n which has the part number and the quantity required.  \\n Later, the parts are delivered  \\n by the first person with the card,  \\n and the second person can then use the card again  \\n to reorder when they need another batch.  \\n Maybe the card is stuck on the front of the transport box  \\n to show what the parts are,  \\n or maybe it's left in the bottom of the box  \\n so that you can reorder easily  \\n when you get to the bottom of all the parts  \\n and the box is empty.  \\n But the main thing is  \\n that you can't ever have more in the system  \\n than the number on the card,  \\n or the number of boxes in the system,  \\n and person one can't make anything until the card arrives.  \\n But it's a simple system and it still works,  \\n even if you have lots of people supplying lots of people.  \\n The other way to communicate the requirement  \\n and to keep the buffer down  \\n is to have a storage area in between the two people  \\n so that person two takes their work from there  \\n and person one can only produce more  \\n when there's space in the buffer.  \\n This means that if person two stops for any reason,  \\n person one must stop as well.  \\n I know this doesn't sound good, but actually it is.  \\n Remember, there's no point in person one  \\n making more than person two needs.  \\n Instead, person one should go and help person two.  \\n This is an interesting and subtle extra benefit  \\n of keeping the stock down with a pull system.  \\n Because there's only a small buffer between them,  \\n the two people are closely linked,  \\n and so they have to work much more as a team.  \\n Similarly, if person one has a problem,  \\n then person two will run out of materials  \\n and will have to go and see if person one is okay  \\n and offer to help.  \\n So you get much better teamwork  \\n and better balancing of capacity.  \\n Going back to my e-mail example,  \\n a pull system would mean that you couldn't e-mail someone  \\n if they already had more than say 20 e-mails in their inbox.  \\n (chuckles) That would be interesting.  \\n You'd have to either go and help them with their workload,  \\n or you'd e-mail one of your other colleagues  \\n who had space in their inbox,  \\n which actually might be a good way to work.  \\n If you had a choice of people to e-mail,  \\n why contact the one who's already snowed under with work?  \\n Once the pull system is working  \\n and people are replenishing the buffers smoothly,  \\n you can then slowly start to reduce the buffers.  \\n So just to recap,  \\n why would we want to stop person one making stuff  \\n when person two can't cope with the supply rate?  \\n The main reason is that you end up  \\n with lots of work in progress, which needs space  \\n and increases the lead time  \\n as stuff has to queue for person two,  \\n 20 days in the case of my wrinkly apples.  \\n And then there's the more subtle reason  \\n that it hides problems.  \\n Person one can be very variable in their deliveries,  \\n or might be making 10% defective work,  \\n but person two can just sort through it  \\n and pick out the good ones.  \\n Or maybe person two has a variable consumption rate,  \\n but that too will be hidden by the buffer between them.  \\n With no buffer, or a very small buffer,  \\n they have to get everything right,  \\n quality, speed, and communication,  \\n which therefore should lead to lower costs  \\n and increased quality, as well as faster throughput.  \\n So what are the push parts of your processes  \\n and could you change any of them over to a pull system,  \\n either with reordering cards  \\n or with reduced work storage areas?  \\n

- We've seen earlier that smaller batches lead to less stock  \\n or less work in-progress,  \\n and all the benefits that come with that.  \\n But of course,  \\n the reason we make things in batches  \\n is to save the setting-up cost.  \\n If it takes you an hour to set up the machine  \\n and then you can make one part every second,  \\n how many would you make in a batch?  \\n Actually, before I tell you the answer,  \\n just think for a moment  \\n and decide how many you would make in your batch.  \\n An hour to set the machine up  \\n and then, it makes one per second.  \\n Most people say, an hour's worth, which would be 3,600.  \\n What if you only use one a month?  \\n Then, you've just made 300 years worth.  \\n Much better to spend the hour setting up  \\n and then, just make 12.  \\n So, the usage rate must affect how many you make.  \\n What else would affect how many you make?  \\n Well, the other factor would be storage cost.  \\n If we're talking sofas,  \\n then you don't want 3,000 of them sitting around.  \\n So, there's a formula called the EBQ,  \\n or economic batch quantity,  \\n which was first worked out 100 years ago  \\n and says that you should make the square root  \\n of two times the annual usage times the setup cost  \\n divided by the annual storage cost per unit.  \\n But don't spend too much time learning this formula  \\n because a lot of people nowadays  \\n don't think it's relevant anymore.  \\n The current thinking is not to say setting up takes ages  \\n so we'll have to make a big batch,  \\n but to stand it on its head and say,  \\n why is the setup time so long?  \\n Once you have the idea  \\n that setting up time could be reduced,  \\n maybe right down to almost nothing, it changes everything.  \\n On TV, I saw some people change a car engine in 58 seconds.  \\n They drove it into the studio, uncoupled the engine,  \\n lifted it out, put a new one in,  \\n and drove the car out of the studio in under a minute.  \\n So, why does it take a whole hour  \\n to change jobs on a milling machine  \\n or to change the tools on an injection molder?  \\n If you film people doing it,  \\n you'll see that they can't find the spanner,  \\n they have to go and fetch equipment,  \\n something breaks, they can't lift something,  \\n they have to find a pallet truck,  \\n it takes five go's to get the adjustment right, etc., etc.,  \\n and all of these things could be streamlined.  \\n If you can save time changing over between batches,  \\n you save much more than just that time.  \\n You gain the ability to make smaller batches efficiently,  \\n which saves you space and lead-time  \\n throughout your whole process.  \\n This is exactly the same with the things you buy.  \\n There is an almost identical formula called EOQ,  \\n economic order quantity,  \\n which tells you in theory how many you should buy at a time.  \\n And as before, it's based on the usage, the ordering cost,  \\n and the storage cost, and again,  \\n the point is that rather than worrying about this,  \\n the first question to ask is,  \\n why can't we get a system where things can be ordered  \\n and delivered in smaller quantities?  \\n Even though it costs more to make,  \\n the saving on shipping, etc., makes it worth doing,  \\n in some cases at least.  \\n Even in offices,  \\n you get batching of work  \\n because changeover always has a cost.  \\n Does the person who processes invoices  \\n store up a week's worth  \\n and then, do them in one load on Fridays?  \\n Could they do them every day  \\n so that suppliers don't have to wait a week for payment?  \\n And purchasing is often centralized  \\n with the aim of buying things more cheaply.  \\n This is equivalent to batching it together,  \\n and it has hidden costs of waiting and administering.  \\n So, the moral of this section  \\n is that reducing setting-up time saves you much more  \\n than just that little bit of time.  \\n It makes it possible to make smaller batches,  \\n which, in turn, reduces your lead time  \\n and your stock holding costs.  \\n And formulas like EBQ and EOQ,  \\n the economic batch and order quantities,  \\n become irrelevant at last.  \\n Everything flows from this one idea of quicker changeover,  \\n quicker setting-up.  \\n So, the question I'd like you to ponder after all this is,  \\n what do you have that's in batches?  \\n Whether it's things you buy, things you make,  \\n or things that you do,  \\n and could those batches be made smaller?  \\n And if it means  \\n that the setting-up becomes too time-consuming,  \\n don't give you, but ask yourself,  \\n how can you reduce your set-up time?  \\n

people  \\n are the most valuable process improvement asset  \\n that you've got  \\n if you could motivate them to care about quality.  \\n Back in the 1960s, Professor Ishikawa, in Japan,  \\n had the idea of a quality circle,  \\n where management would actually ask the workers  \\n for help and ideas.  \\n This was quite radical at the time,  \\n and in some companies, still would be.  \\n The idea is that you put together a team  \\n involving everyone from all levels and all disciplines.  \\n And then that team works on a particular problem  \\n and solves it.  \\n Just because they may not be educated  \\n or important in the hierarchy,  \\n these normal people are where most of the ideas are.  \\n They know what really goes on.  \\n And they love to be asked.  \\n It's really motivational to be part of a team,  \\n working on an important problem.  \\n And quality circles were a big success in the 1960s.  \\n But since then, they've been forgotten a bit,  \\n and I think that's a shame.  \\n One of the things that replaced them,  \\n which can work well, but is harder to sustain,  \\n is the idea of continuous improvement, or Kaizen.  \\n The idea is that if everyone could make their part  \\n of the process just a couple of percent better,  \\n then the whole company  \\n would move relentlessly towards perfection.  \\n I read somewhere that Toyota  \\n implement 5,000 suggestion improvements a week.  \\n They don't just receive 5,000 suggestions,  \\n they implement them.  \\n Their workforce are constantly thinking  \\n about ways to make things slightly better.  \\n Most Western companies have suggestion schemes,  \\n but a typical scheme probably only receives  \\n about 20 ideas a year.  \\n And half of those are anonymous, rude suggestions  \\n concerning the boss.  \\n And I think that's a real problem  \\n with continuous improvement in Western companies.  \\n We get bored with it.  \\n So, if you can have a regular process improvement meeting,  \\n then that's great.  \\n But if you're finding it hard to sustain that,  \\n then at least pick your biggest problem  \\n and set up a quality circle to investigate it and fix it.  \\n Give them some time, some money and some empowerment  \\n to get on and fix it,  \\n and you'll be amazed at how much they achieve.  \\n And they'll enjoy doing it.  \\n So, I'd like you to think about  \\n what your biggest quality problem is,  \\n and who you could have on the quality circle team.  \\n

A lot of the things  \\n are parts of what are known as Lean Thinking and Six Sigma.  \\n I feel a bit of love and hate for these,  \\n because they contain lots of good ideas,  \\n but as programs I think they have some difficulties.  \\n Six Sigma doesn't really contain anything new,  \\n it's really about training your senior managers  \\n in known quality improvement techniques  \\n like SPC, quality circles, and some of the other things  \\n I've been covering on this course.  \\n The difference is that it's not the quality department,  \\n it's your senior managers, who are seconded  \\n onto the Six Sigma projects, and who drive it.  \\n I like that idea, although I can see some problems  \\n with persuading them to give up their jobs  \\n for a couple of years to join a quality improvement program.  \\n Six Sigma has recently combined itself with Lean  \\n to give it extra weight,  \\n and Lean does indeed include lots of great ideas.  \\n Again, I've been covering my favorite ones on this course,  \\n things like reducing queues, bringing in pull systems,  \\n identifying bottlenecks and reducing batch sizes.  \\n Lean was used for manufacturing originally,  \\n coming from Toyota to start with,  \\n and although lots of consultants are selling it  \\n for the service sector, some of the ideas  \\n don't really translate across very well.  \\n But some of the ideas do apply to the service sector,  \\n and also to support functions as well.  \\n For example, pull systems work best for manufacturing,  \\n but quality circles work really well for all areas.  \\n So Lean Thinking is mainly about reducing waste  \\n and getting a good flow through the system,  \\n smaller batches, smaller queues.  \\n While Six Sigma is more about reducing problems  \\n and variation, but you can see how they overlap  \\n because although Lean is about reducing waste,  \\n to do this requires improved quality,  \\n which is Six Sigma.  \\n So rather than employ expensive consultants  \\n to have a short term binge on Lean and Six Sigma  \\n before they go away again,  \\n it might be better to gradually change your managers  \\n in the various techniques  \\n and

Before you can improve a process,\\nyou need to know whether it needs improving.\\nAnd then, as soon as you start to intervene,\\nsome might say interfere, you need to know\\nwhether you've made a

year\\nwill be better than last year even if you do nothing.\\nSo we need to measure what's going on with our processes.\\n\\nIn fact, it's been said that if you can't measure it,\\nyou can't manage it.\\nBut do you think that's really true?\\nCan't we manage something without being able\\nto reduce it down to a number?\\nIn fact, can everything be measured?\\nWhat about quality or service\\nor

there's a risk that you'll end up assuming\\nthings are okay when maybe they're not,\\nand you won't take action until they've got really bad\\nand the problem has become visible\\neven to someone

If you try to measure everything, that could take\\na lot of work, and you might end up not knowing\\nwhich numbers to focus on.\\nOften measurements are self-contradictory too.\\nYou might be wanting to increase quality and reduce costs\\nand be measuring both.\\nBut then which one do you give priority to?\\nAnd, of course, if you do get your cost down,\\nyou need to make sure it's not affecting your quality\\nor anything else important.\\nNever measure or try to interpret just one number\\nwithout context.\\n\\nIf your turnover has gone up, what about your profit?\\nMaybe someone's been cutting prices in order to sell more.\\nAnd if your numbers employed have gone up,\\nis that good or bad?\\nIt depends on your turnover.\\nEven something like complaints may have gone up\\nbecause you're getting better at listening to your customers\\nor doing some ambitious work.\\nSo never measure just one number.\\nThere's something hard to resist about numbers.\\nWhen you hear that your local school is 5% worse\\nthan the one in the next neighborhood to you,\\nimmediately you feel unhappy.\\n\\nBut actually what does worse mean?\\nAnd is 5% really significant?\\nWas it just a blip when usually it's better\\nthan other schools?\\nAnd maybe your school is worse at one thing\\nbut they're better in other ways that are more important.\\nHow do we know that the school down the road\\nisn't just better at playing the game,\\nso that they're getting a better score\\nat the cost of areas that aren't measured?\\nA recent example of this in the UK was that the government\\nis trying to measure doctors, and they published\\na league table of scores, but it was discredited\\nand discontinued because some quite important factors\\nweren't in the scoring,\\nand also the weighting of the factors was debatable,\\nand it was hard to take into account the affect of living\\nin richer and poorer areas.\\n\\nAnd most importantly, the doctors who were prepared\\nto take on the most difficult patients\\nwere getting lower scores despite being probably better.\\nSo should we give up and ignore measurements?\\nWell, that would be a shame.\\nWithout measurements, we haven't really got anything at all.\\nBut the thing is not to judge people from the measurements,\\nbut to take measurements as a starting point,\\na start for asking, \\\"Why?\\\"\\nWhy has that doctor got a lower score?\\nWhy does that school get better results?\\nThis will tell us what's really going on so that\\nwe can understand the causes of the scores,\\nand then decide whether they really matter.\\n\\nAnd the best way to ask why is to first get a ratio,\\nfor example, infections per operation,\\ndays absent per pupil,\\naccidents per passenger mile,\\nerrors per report, that kind of thing.\\nAnd then compare that ratio either with\\nsimilar people or departments or companies,\\nor with yourself at the same time last year.\\nComparing ratios is the only valid way to interpret\\nstatistics like this.\\n\\n20 infections means nothing.\\n20 infections per hundred operations is better,\\nbut still doesn't tell you enough.\\nWhen you find that everyone else has only 10 infections\\nper hundred, now you're getting somewhere.\\nSo it has to be ratios and then compare.\\nAll the time, you should be questioning the data.\\nAsk yourself if the person giving you the numbers\\nhas a reason to be biased.\\nHow reliable is their source?\\nCould it be happening by chance?\\nAre they looking at the whole picture?\\nAnd can we be sure that A caused B?\\nSo these are my five tests of information.\\n\\nNumber one is, is it likely to be biased?\\nNumber two, is it a number or a ratio?\\nNumber three, is it significant?\\nIn other words, could it have happened by chance?\\nDoes the number vary so much\\nfrom one time period to the next?\\nThis could easily just be a chance blip.\\nAnd what aren't they measuring?\\nAnd finally, can we be sure that one thing\\nreally did cause the other?\\nAs the last part of this video, let's have a closer look\\nat this last question.\\n\\nCausation is particularly tricky.\\nOften numbers are related so that if one goes up\\nthe other one goes up.\\nBut they aren't actually causing each other.\\nThere's just a common cause.\\nFor example, children from educated homes\\nare more likely to read,\\nand also more likely to do well at school.\\nBut that doesn't mean that it's the reading\\nthat's making them do well.\\nIt could be their attitude in the classroom\\nor the homework that they do at home.\\nAnd this distinction is important because if you discover\\na correlation between reading and doing well at school,\\nyou might think, right, every child must read more,\\nand that might be a waste of time.\\n\\nIt might not, of course.\\nBut the point is, we don't know.\\nProving that A is caused by B and not C is tricky.\\nYou'd have to do a controlled experiment\\nand find middle class children who don't read\\nand compare them with those who do,\\nor get some children from a deprived area to read more\\nand see if they improve more than an identical group\\nwho don't read.\\nJust finding an existing correlation is lazy\\nand doesn't prove anything at all.\\nSimilarly at work, finding out what makes you sell more\\ncould be tricky.\\n\\nIf you reduced the price and sell more,\\ncould it have been something else that caused it?\\nDid anything else change at the same time?\\nSo as an exercise, I'd like you to think about\\nwhat you measure at the moment.\\nAre you measuring just one thing, out of context?\\nAre you measuring too many things to the point\\nwhere you don't know which ones to focus on?\\nAre you measuring ratios rather than straight numbers?\\nAnd are you comparing them with similar people\\nor time periods?\\nAnd are you sure about your causations?\\nThis is the fundamental basis for improving\\nyour processes later, so you need to get this\\ninitial measurement right.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:451913\",\"duration\":348,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Using statistical

work,\\nlike how well a room is cleaned\\nor how well a meal is cooked,\\nthen it's already too late.\\n\\nI suppose you can learn for next time\\nand do things better as a result of the inspection,\\nbut it's not really as good as controlling the processes.\\nKnowing that your oven is the right temperature\\nand the turkey is in there for the right amount of time\\nis much better than going,\\n\\\"Oh dear, the turkey is burned.\\\"\\nSo, the idea is that we know the temperature and the time\\nand we make sure we get that right every time.\\nWe might even experiment with a hotter oven\\nfor a shorter time, a cooler oven for a longer time,\\ntil we find out how to cook the perfect turkey\\nand then stick to that every time.\\n\\nThis is process control\\nand it's easy for a turkey,\\nbut it's tricky for cleaning or writing software\\nor making a training video.\\nSomehow, you have to find out what the key ingredients\\nof the process are and then,\\nmake sure you get those right.\\nThat's where the statistical part comes in.\\nHave a look at this target.\\nTwo marksmen are firing their rifles at the target.\\nFirst, marksman A has shot as follows.\\nHe has hit the target every time\\nand his the bulls eye once.\\n\\nThen, marksman B has shot as follows.\\nShe has missed the target once\\nand hasn't hit the bulls eye at all.\\nBut who is the better marksman?\\nYes, it's marksman B,\\nbecause her grouping is better.\\nGrouping is a term for how much variation there is\\nbetween her shots.\\nThe fact that her grouping is already good\\nmeans that her results are quite easy to improve.\\nShe just needs to adjust her sights and she'll be spot on.\\nMarksman A on the other hand, oh dear.\\n\\nTo improve him, he needs a new rifle\\nor maybe a new eye or a new, more steady arm,\\nwhich isn't going to be easy.\\nSo, basically, there are two reasons for failure,\\nwhich are drifting of the average,\\nthat's the sights out of adjustment,\\nor too much variation.\\nThat's the unsteady hand.\\nTo just inspect the target and say, \\\"You missed,\\\"\\ndoesn't tell us why.\\nSo, we don't know what to change\\nin order to get better.\\nIf we did everything by the recipe\\nbut our turkey is burned,\\nit means that either the oven is out of calibration\\nor the temperature is fluctuating in the oven.\\n\\nBut which?\\nTo find out whether it's drift or variation,\\nwe need to do the equivalent of assessing the grouping.\\nSo, we take four random readings\\nand see how spread out they are.\\nIf they're all very close, we know it's\\nthe calibration of the oven temperature.\\nBut if they're all over the place,\\nwe know the temperature control is failing.\\nAlso, this sample of four gives us a measure\\nof what the average is without being misled\\nby the occasional blip.\\n\\nAnd if we take samples every hour\\nor every day, we can track whether the average is drifting.\\nSo, the sample of four allows us to track\\nboth drift and variation\\nand we then put both of these on graphs\\nso that we can see what the process is doing over time.\\nAnd even better, not only does this tell us\\nwhy we failed and what to do to fix it,\\nbut it also gives us warning of problems\\nbefore we fail.\\nIf our oven is starting to drift out of calibration,\\nthe SPC graphs will tell us long before\\nwe can taste anything wrong with the turkey.\\n\\nSo, we'll never get to the embarrassing point\\nwhere the Christmas dinner is a disaster\\nor something is sent to a customer that's wrong.\\nImagine if you tracked the time taken\\nto serve customers\\nor the number of typo's in reports.\\nYou'd know if things were getting worse\\nhopefully before there was a complaint.\\nThe key is that it has to be measureable\\nin order to apply these statistics\\nand draw the graphs.\\nSo, if you were say, an architectural practice,\\nyou want to get an actual number\\nfor how much the client's like the designs\\ndone by each of your architects\\nand then track them on graphs\\nso you could look for the average.\\n\\nIs it drifting?\\nAnd also, how much spread is there?\\nHow much does each architect vary?\\nAre any getting worse or more variable?\\nDo you want one that averages high\\nbut is controversial or one that averages\\nonly medium, but is consistent?\\nAt least you'd have the facts\\nin order to be able to decide these things.\\nI think you can see that pass fail doesn't come close\\nbecause it's too late and it gives you\\nno real understanding of what's actually happening\\nin your process.\\n\\nSo, that's SPC and of course,\\nthe question is, how can you apply it\\nto your part of the business?\\nWhat are you key processes\\nand what are the indicators within those processes\\nthat you could measure and that you could track\\non graphs over time?\\nThese could be things like costs, waste,\\nhours taken, overall deliver lead time,\\npercentage delivered on time,\\nquality accuracy or customer

Okay, in the last section we talked about\\nthe principles of SPC, without using any maths.\\nIn this section, I want to introduce you\\nto a couple of useful mathematical formulas,\\none of which is very simple,\\nand the other one, which sounds quite horrible,\\nbut is actually easy to work out and very useful.\\nThe easy one first.\\nThe question is, when a machine or a process,\\nor a department, has performed badly,\\nhow do we know if it's really out of tolerance,\\ni.e. something really has gone wrong,\\nor whether they were just unlucky?\\nFor example, suppose the people in my department\\nare meant to reply to customer enquiries within three days\\nand I've had a complaint that last week\\nthey were actually replying in five days.\\n\\nIs there a problem, or was it just an unlucky week\\nwith some difficult customers and more work than normal?\\nOf course, if I ask them, they'll say they were just unlucky\\nso I need a way to measure and track what's really going on.\\nSo let's say I set up a graph of response time,\\nmaybe for each day, and I can see if it's drifting upwards\\nor if it's jumping all over the place\\nfrom one day to the next,\\nboth possible causes of failure,\\nas we've seen in the section on SPC just now.\\nThe question is, where do I set my action level?\\nIf they have one day of poor performance,\\nthat will be too short to really know\\nand I'd be wading in prematurely,\\nwhile a whole year of consistently poor performance\\nwould certainly be enough to know for sure,\\nin fact I would have definitely waited\\ntoo long to take action.\\n\\nIdeally, I'd be sitting in there with them\\nfeeling the atmosphere and seeing the detail,\\nrather than having to rely on just some numbers,\\nbut if I can't do that and all I have to go on\\nis their performance figures,\\nI need a way to know when to act.\\nHow many days in a row do they need\\nto perform badly, or unusually well,\\nbefore I can be sure that something\\nhas changed in this department?\\nAmazingly, there is a simple answer, and it's eight.\\nThat's right, eight days in a row,\\nand I need to investigate and make some changes.\\n\\nSix or seven days in a row could be just bad luck.\\nI need to wait and see.\\nThis really goes against human nature.\\nAfter only two or three days in a row we think,\\n\\\"I need to get in there!\\\"\\nAnd don't get me wrong, if we're talking accidents\\nor deaths or huge amounts of money,\\nthen you should be in there after one.\\nBut then you'd be sitting in there anyway,\\nas I mentioned earlier.\\nBut generally our human nature is to overreact,\\nand spot trends way before there really are any.\\n\\nThis is a survival instinct.\\nIf the bush wiggles and a tiger jumps out,\\nwe assume that every wiggle might be a tiger.\\nThe guy who goes, \\\"I need to see eight tigers\\n\\\"before I'll worry\\\" would be dead!\\nBut if you toss a coin three times\\nand you get heads on all three,\\nyou don't assume it's a special coin, do you?\\nYou need more facts than that,\\nand work should be the same, it should be scientific.\\nAnd the answer is eight, because that's the point\\nat which it's less than 1% likely\\nto have happened by chance.\\n\\nNow just to clarify this, if an event is very unlikely\\nand it happens several times in a row,\\nthen you should be suspicious.\\nBut we're talking about figures being slightly\\nabove the average, which is only 50% unlikely,\\nand that's where you use this figure of eight.\\nIf times or complaints or costs are over the average\\neight times in a row, then the probability of that happening\\nby chance is a half to the pair of eight,\\nor one in 256, which is about half a percent.\\n\\nSo we can be slightly over 99% sure\\nthat something really has changed,\\nand there's less than a 1% chance that it's pure bad luck.\\nNow, that was the easy one, eight.\\nThe next one I want to go on to is the harder one\\nbut as I mentioned at the start,\\nthis formula is actually very useful,\\nso please do make the effort to understand it\\nand then you can try it out for real in your work.\\nAnd the great thing about these Lynda videos\\nis that you can pause them and get a pencil and paper\\nor watch them more than once.\\n\\nI would urge you to make some notes, and also\\nto watch this next bit more than once if you need to.\\nSo, we've already seen that if an event is 50/50 likely\\nto happen, like something being above average,\\nthen you need eight before you can be sure\\nthat something's changed.\\nBut what if the event is quite unlikely?\\nThen you need fewer before you know\\nthat something's changed.\\nIn fact, turning the question right around,\\nhow unlikely does something have to be\\nbefore just one occurrence warrants an investigation?\\nWhat is the warning level at which\\nyou should act and investigate?\\nFor example, have you noticed how your credit card\\nsometimes gets stopped, and you get a phone call,\\nif you buy something unusually large\\nor several quite large things?\\nThe credit card people are doing exactly this calculation\\nto prevent fraud, and personally I'm glad they are\\neven though it can be a bit annoying at times.\\n\\nThe weather forecasting people are also doing this.\\nWe know that eight above average summers in a row\\nwould show climate change,\\nbut what about three really hot ones,\\nor one incredibly hot one?\\nHow hot would the one have to be?\\nIn your case, how many complaints\\nwould you have to have in one month\\nfor you to get into action and investigate?\\nHow much over-budget would that department have to be?\\nHow many accidents or days off sick\\nin that part of your business?\\nHow low would sales have to be in just one month\\nfor you to have to investigate?\\nBasically, with anything you're measuring,\\nwhat should be the trigger point?\\nI think you can see how useful this will be to know,\\nand also that if you don't know it,\\nthen almost what's the point of measuring anything?\\nSo, the formula for this action point is the mean\\n+ or - 3.14 times the MMR,\\nwhere the MMR is the Median Moving Range.\\n\\nDon't panic, I'll explain.\\nTake this column of numbers, these are the numbers\\nof accidents each month at a railway station.\\nBy the way, I don't mean train crashes,\\nI just mean someone slipping over\\non a patch of spilt coffee or something like that.\\nEvery little thing gets recorded these days.\\nNow, suppose I get these from 100 different railway stations\\nand I want a way to monitor them and tell me\\nwhether I need to investigate a particular station.\\nHere's how I do the calculation.\\n\\nFirst, the mean is 7.9.\\nI get this by adding up all the numbers, and dividing\\nby how many numbers there are.\\nNext, I need the MMR, the Median Moving Range.\\nThis is simpler than it sounds.\\nI get this by working out the size of the change\\nfrom one number to the next, always written\\nas a positive number, whether it's going up or down.\\nAnd I put them in between the numbers like this.\\nNext, you sort them into order, and take the middle one\\nwhich you can see is a four.\\n\\nYou can imagine how this would be easy with a spreadsheet\\nor getting it done automatically by a computer.\\nThis middle number is your Median Moving Range, or MMR.\\nWhat it really is, is the typical amount\\nthat the number changes by from one day to the next.\\nIt's a measure of how spiky the data is.\\nYou can see that if this is small, then any reasonable\\nchange to the number of accidents\\nis going to be significant.\\nWhile, if the MMR is large, then you're going to need\\na huge change in the number of accidents before I panic.\\n\\nSo finally the formula tells us that the action point\\nis 3.14 MMRs above the mean.\\nIn my example, the MMR is four,\\nso the action point is 3.14 times 4,\\nwhich is about 12 and a half above the mean,\\nso that's the mean of 7.9, plus 12 and a half,\\nwhich is about 20 and a half.\\nSo if I hear of 21 accidents or more,\\nthen I need to investigate.\\n\\nAny fewer than 20, say 17 accidents in one month,\\nit's just random variation, unless\\nit happens eight times in a row.\\nAnd that's how you work it out,\\nyou get the gaps, you find the middle sized one, the MMR,\\nyou multiply it by 3.14, and you add it to the mean.\\nYou could use this method to monitor anything\\nthat you wanna keep an eye on.\\nSales, costs, mistakes, lead times, temperatures,\\namount of scrap or rework, complaints, etc.\\n\\nAnd, clearly, the action limit would be above the mean,\\nif it's a problem that you're looking out for\\nand you don't want it to go above a certain limit.\\nWhile it would be below the mean\\nif you are measuring something desirable,\\nlike sales or production output\\nand you don't want it to drop below a lower limit.\\nThat's why the formula is the mean plus or minus 3.14\\ntimes the MMR.\\nSo the question is, what could you try this on?\\nWhat do you measure, or could you measure,\\nwhere an action limit would be useful to have?\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

a function of variability,\\nwhich is more likely to be to do with quality.\\n\\nIf things vary each time you do them,\\nmaybe having to be done twice,\\nthen your on time delivery will be

reducing your quality.\\nHigher quality usually takes longer to produce.\\nOr less obviously, it costs you more to produce\\nthings quicker, and I'll explain that in a minute.\\n\\nMany organizations haven't really thought this through.\\nThey want to deliver great quality at a low price\\nand as soon as the customer wants it\\nand often this is what's promised to the customer\\nby the sales guise or by the advertising campaign\\nand the plan is to deliver it by either putting lots of\\npressure on the work force, maybe even shouting at them,\\nor by putting one person in charge of each

speed of delivery\\nand making a conscious realistic decision to be less good\\nat the other two factors.\\nGenerally, in most markets there's been a trend from cost\\nto quality and then to

Does it cost more to make a better product\\nor to provide a better service?\\nAt first sight, you would think yes, wouldn't you?\\nWell, let's play a little game.\\nI just want you to pause this video for a moment\\nand draw a graph with quality along\\nthe horizontal from naught to 10,\\nwhere naught is complete rubbish,\\nthrough to 10, which is perfection.\\nThen on the vertical axis, I want you to have cost.\\nWhat does it cost to make products\\nof that quality or to provide a service\\nof that quality?\\nDraw what shape you think the graph is.\\n\\nWhen I do this on training courses,\\n19 out of 20 people get it wrong,\\nso good luck, have a go now.\\nOkay, here are some possible graphs\\nthat I've been shown over the years\\nof training I've been doing this,\\nand they're all wrong.\\nI wonder whether yours was one of these.\\nNow, the real one is this shape.\\nDid you guess it?\\nI hope you did.\\nNow, I'm going to explain\\nwhy it's this shape now.\\n\\nThere are two parts to the cost of quality,\\nthe first one being what's known as prevention cost.\\nThis does increase as you increase your quality.\\nThis is the cost of making sure things are done well,\\nso it includes things like training,\\nhaving quality control systems and good management,\\nhaving great equipment and materials,\\nand employing good people.\\nIt gets very expensive to make everything perfectly.\\nIn fact, it increases exponentially,\\nbecoming infinite when you approach perfection.\\n\\nTo not have a single piece of litter in the street\\nwould mean you need a line of road sweeper guys\\nat one meter intervals all along every street,\\nfor example.\\nThe other cost of quality is the failure cost.\\nThis increases as your quality decreases.\\nAs you become more and more rubbish,\\nyou have to pay more to scrap things,\\nrework things, handle complaints from customers,\\nlose contracts, maybe even get sued.\\nYou can see that using cheap materials,\\ncheap equipment and employing the cheapest people\\nor paying your people badly is actually\\ngoing to have a cost.\\n\\nThe question is whether it costs you more\\nthan you save.\\nThat's where we can combine these two graphs\\nto get the total cost.\\nAs you can see, on the right,\\nthe failure cost had dwindled to almost zero,\\nso the total cost is pretty much\\njust the prevention cost.\\nSimilarly, on the left, we've become so bad\\nthat we were doing pretty much no prevention,\\nand the only cost is the failure cost, which is high.\\nIn the middle, where the two graphs cross,\\nour failure cost is the same as our prevention cost,\\nand the total is double each of these.\\n\\nSo the total cost is U-shaped,\\nwith the point of minimum cost being in the middle.\\nThis is the cheapest place to be.\\nI'll explain in a moment why you don't\\nactually want to be there, but just to say\\nthat most organizations don't realize\\nthat this is the cheapest point\\nbecause they don't measure their failure costs.\\nThey are painfully aware\\nof their prevention costs,\\nthe cost of training, the cost of quality control,\\nthe cost of upmarket materials\\nand precise machinery.\\n\\nThere's always pressure to reduce all these costs.\\nThese costs have budgets, which are monitored\\nand cut slightly every year, et cetera,\\nso there's always pressure to reduce quality\\nin order to save money, but they forget\\nthe invisible failure costs.\\nThere's no budget for doing things twice\\nor handling complaints.\\nThe cost of lost customers or wasted staff time\\nisn't measured as a separate thing,\\nso it's easy to forget that as you reduce\\nyour prevention costs, you're also increasing\\nyour failure costs, perhaps by more,\\nas you move to the left of the middle point.\\n\\nSo why wouldn't we want to be right in the middle\\nat this point of minimum cost?\\nThe answer is because it's not the point\\nof maximum profit.\\nThis is because if you move from five\\nto about seven, your costs only go up a little bit\\nbecause each increase in prevention\\nin largely outweighed by saving and failure costs,\\nand yet, you can charge more or sell more\\nat the same price, so your profit will go up.\\n\\nIf your sales volume or price\\nlooks like this extra line I've added,\\nyou can see that the point of maximum profit,\\nand profit is sales minus costs,\\nis to the right of the middle,\\nThis is where you and your organization should be.\\nSo, there are four important learning points\\nfrom all this.\\nNumber one, choosing low quality\\non anything is a false economy.\\nFailure costs are often not measured,\\nor they can even be invisible in the short term,\\nlike reduced operator morale\\nor reduced repeat business, so it's easy\\nto make the wrong decisions about quality.\\n\\nNumber two is the point of minimum costs\\nis not the best place to be.\\nIt's not where the maximum profit is.\\nThirdly, the point of maximum profit\\nis at about seven,\\nso how can you get there?\\nAnd fourthly, trying to achieve a quality of 10\\nwill cost you more than you make from it.\\nIt's not worth trying to reach 10.\\nNow, a final thought is how can we\\nactually make this graph for real?\\nHow can we really know where we are on it?\\nIt's a good theory, but how do you\\napply it to real life?\\nWell, I think the answer is that you start\\nby listing and estimating your prevention costs,\\nand, perhaps even more importantly,\\nyour failure costs.\\n\\nYou can then start to think about whether\\ninvesting in better quality, whether it's people\\nor equipment or materials or methods,\\nwould pay for itself.\\nIf your failure costs are greater\\nthan your prevention costs,\\nthen you definitely have a problem.\\nIf your prevention and failure costs\\nare roughly equal, then you know\\nyou're at the point of lowest costs,\\nwhich isn't bad, but ideally, you'd move up\\nfrom there towards higher quality a bit.\\nIf your prevention costs are roughly double\\nyour failure costs, then you're spot on.\\n\\nThat's the point to be aiming for.\\nSo I'd like you to think about\\nhow you'll measure your failure costs.\\nWhat are the things that are costing you money,\\nand how much, roughly, do you think\\nthey're costing?\\nPeople who I show this to on my training courses\\noften say, \\\"Wow, I wish my boss knew about this,\\\"\\nso maybe another action you could take\\nis to get your boss to watch this video\\nthat you've just watched.\\nThen between you, you can save a load of

In any company there is a certain amount of waste.\\nFor example in meetings how much of\\nyour time is really productive?\\nIn fact in your working day how\\nmuch of your time is productive?\\nTime is important because your biggest\\ncost might well be your people\\nwhich is effectively their time.\\nAnd then what proportion of materials are thrown away\\nand what's that costing you per year?\\nExpensive resources like machinery, laboratories\\nand even office space, what is their utilization?\\nAre they used all the time with no space wasted\\non piles of stuff that hasn't moved for weeks?\\nThere's a Japanese theory about waste\\nwhich says that there are seven types.\\n\\nAlthough I personally like a way to remember\\nthem that spells out the word downtime\\nand adds an eighth one and here it is.\\nThe D of downtime is for defects\\nwhich cost you money even if you find out\\nimmediately and cost lots more if you do further\\nwork on them before you realize they're defective\\nor even ship them out the a customer heaven forbid.\\nThe O of downtime stands for overproduction,\\nmaking more than you need maybe because you\\nmake things in large batches or for stock\\nwhich then have to be stored and checked\\nand which tie up your capital.\\n\\nThe W of downtime stands for waiting\\nwhich means the time the product spends\\nwaiting rather than the time that people spend waiting.\\nThis could be half finished products waiting\\nwhile a machine is set up or while other parts\\nin the batch are worked on or waiting while\\na broken machine gets repaired.\\nIt's what makes the difference between the small\\namount of time it takes to make that product\\nand the full lead time that the customer has to wait for it.\\nAnd remember this isn't just amount manufacturing\\nthe service might be you waiting to get the keys\\nfor your car at the hire car desk,\\nthe keys are the product that you're waiting for\\nand how much time did they spend\\nwaiting to be given to you?\\nThe N of downtime stands for nonused employee talent.\\n\\nThis is the extra one that takes us from\\nseven to eight by the way and isn't it a good one?\\nEvery person that works for you that has talent that the\\norganization hasn't tapped into is a wasted resource.\\nThis could be the biggest waste in most organizations,\\nI bet you know people, hopefully not you,\\nwho coast through their working day not really\\nengaged with their job because the company's\\nfailed to excite them and yet in their personal\\nlife they coach the football team or do\\nany number of really impressive things.\\n\\nAnd that's because they have that spare energy\\nand potential that work isn't making use of.\\nThe T of downtime stands for transportation\\nwhich you would ideally minimize by good\\ndesign of your factory or offices,\\nthis is any movement of components or\\npaper or equipment around the sight\\nand which can really add up if you\\nwere to follow a job from its start to it's final dispatch.\\nThe I of downtime stands for Inventory\\nwhich is raw materials, work in progress\\nor finished materials ready for shipment.\\n\\nAnd which means that you've got money\\ntied up in it as well as the cost of\\nstoring it and looking after it.\\nThe M stands for motion which is not the\\nsame as transportation, it means wear and tear\\non the machines and on people and it comes\\nwith risks of accidents and damage.\\nAnd finally the E of downtime stands for\\nExcessive processing which includes over design,\\nmaking things too good or doing operations\\nto a part of the product or service that the\\ncustomer won't see or care about.\\n\\nSometimes engineers can be perfectionists and\\ncan design something to be better than it needs to be.\\nClearly it's worth making sure that you minimize\\nall of these and a good start would be to look at\\nevery stage of your processes with these in mind.\\nFinally on the subject of waste there's\\na nice little idea called poka-yoke which means\\nfoolproofing of design in Japanese.\\nYou design things so that it's impossible\\nto get them wrong like the way the diesel filling\\nnozzle for your car is too big to go into a petrol\\nfiller hole so you can't put diesel in by mistake.\\n\\nAlthough I did manage to put petrol into my diesel car once.\\nMaybe they should have a round one and\\na square one so that neither can go into another.\\nAnd poka-yoke is not just product design but systems too,\\nideally you set up all systems so that it's actually\\nimpossible for people to do them wrongly.\\nFor example I often leave my memory stick\\nbehind in people's computers but recently\\nI've put it on my car keys so that now I\\nphysically can't drive away leaving my\\nmemory stick behind however senile I become.\\n\\nSo I'd just like you to think about the commonest\\nmistakes that gets made in your area of work\\nand how could you design something in so that\\nit can't happen, it physically can't\\nand then going back to the areas of waste\\nI mentioned earlier just now with downtime\\nwhat are your main areas of waste and what\\ncan you do to reduce

science and theories behind lead time.\\nAnd that's what I want to go into with you now.\\n\\nBy the way, the simplest way to be able\\nto deliver a product quickly is to keep them in stock.\\nIt doesn't matter how long it takes to make them\\nif you keep some in stock, does it?\\nAlthough, in a way, yes it does\\nbecause stock is almost always a bad idea.\\nIt costs money for the space to store it.\\nIt goes out of date.\\nIt gets damaged or pilfered.\\nIt needs managing and checking.\\nIt's capital tied up.\\nAnd it allows you to get away with being less\\nand less efficient in your manufacturing.\\n\\nKeeping stock reduces your ability to be flexible\\nand to make exactly what each customer wants.\\nIt necessitates accurate forecasting of future demand,\\nwhich might be impossible.\\nAnd when you don't have the item in stock,\\nyou're really stuck.\\nSo, there are lots of hidden costs to keeping stock,\\nwhich people often don't take into account.\\nAnd of course, services can't be kept in stock.\\nEverything from hot pizzas to heart transplants\\ncan't be kept on the shelf.\\n\\nThey have to be produced with ideally\\nthe minimum waiting time.\\nSo, for anything you currently keep in stock,\\na good question to ask yourself is\\nam I sure we can't make this to order,\\nif we really wanted to?\\nIt might cost a bit more, but actually we'd probably\\nsave money as well by not having it in stock.\\nBut whether you're making for stock\\nor whether you're making for customers,\\nthe next question is\\nhow can we make it in a shorter lead time?\\nI'm going to go into detail on this in the next few sections\\nbut an overview of the problem is this.\\n\\nWhy does it take so long to make things?\\nI used to work in a helicopter factory and it took\\nthree years to make a gear wheel for a helicopter gear box.\\nAnd yet, there was only two weeks of actual metal cutting.\\nThe rest of the time was all transporting\\nstuff around the factory and waiting to start the batch.\\nOften there were ten other batches\\nalso waiting for that machine.\\nAnd then waiting for the rest of your big batch.\\nSome batches were 500 parts\\nbefore finally your part gets made.\\n\\nIf you were to follow the piece of metal\\nor the piece of paper or a person in a hospital.\\nThe item being worked on is a person.\\nIf you follow those through the process,\\nyou'll find that they have four main activities.\\nThe first one is transferring from one part\\nof the process to the next.\\nThen there's waiting in the queue to be operated upon.\\nThen there's waiting while the rest\\nof the batch are operated on.\\nAnd then finally, the only valuated activity in all this,\\nbeing operated on themselves.\\n\\nBy the way,\\nthe same principles apply to an office environment,\\nso this could be the time from\\ngetting a planning application in\\nto finally being able to say yes or no to the new building.\\nOr maybe, someone's applying for a VISA or a green card\\nor maybe someone's going into hospital for an operation.\\nIt could be the time it takes to get from\\narriving at the airport to getting onto your plane.\\nOr the time it takes to get your car serviced.\\nOr the time it takes to get your pizza in a restaurant.\\nOr the time it takes to produce\\na training course like this one.\\n\\nThese are all lead times.\\nNow, queues happen in the form of piles of paper\\non people's desks and in their email inboxes.\\nAnd in the form of waiting lists.\\nA six month waiting list for a doctor\\nis really a six month queue of people.\\nBut luckily for the doctor, it's invisible.\\nImagine a six moth line of people stretching down\\nhis corridor and several miles down the street\\noutside the hospital.\\n\\nSo, the thee ways to get things through quicker are\\nnumber one, having a better layout,\\nso you can move things from one machine or person\\nor department to the next more quickly.\\nThere are probably not much savings there,\\nbut it's worth thinking about\\nespecially if you're making something big like cars.\\nThe second method would be reducing\\nthe queues at each operation, which could be done\\nby having plenty capacity, although that's expensive.\\nOr maybe by being very clever about how\\nyou schedule things through the system\\nso that you make things in the best order\\nand queues don't build up.\\n\\nAlthough, even with today's powerful computers,\\nthis is still very difficult to achieve\\nbecause there are so many variables and unknowns.\\nOr you could do it by simplifying the problem\\nby focusing only on the bottle neck\\nor by using pull systems,\\nboth of which I'll come to later on in the course.\\nAnd the third way, will be reducing the batch waiting time\\nby making

The first thing to look at when you want\\nto streamline any process is can we reduce\\nthe number of steps?\\nAnd this is part of something called business\\nprocess reengineering or BPR,\\nwhich really just consists of looking at the way\\nwe do things, ideally drawing the processes out\\nas a flow diagram, and then asking the following\\nfour questions.\\nNumber one: can any steps be just deleted?\\nYou might be surprised at how many steps\\nthere are in your process.\\n\\nForms filled in, data put into computers,\\nwork allocated to people, quality checked\\nby supervisors, et cetera, et cetera.\\nDoes the supervisor really have to check it?\\nCan the manager type in their own data?\\nDo we need to print out that order form?\\nDo we need to file a paper copy of it?\\nThe second thing to do with BPR is to ask yourself\\ncan any steps by automated by a computer?\\nThis is almost as good as getting rid of them.\\n\\nAnd although in many cases it's already been done,\\nsome managers may not know what's possible.\\nSo it could be worth drawing out the whole process\\nand then asking the question from one or more\\ntechnical types who know what can be computerized.\\nIn fact, I've only got one word to say to you: pivot tables.\\nOr was that two words?\\nBy the way, if you don't know what pivot tables are,\\nthen there might well be steps in your processes\\nthat you could automate and save a whole lot\\nof time.\\nYou should definitely investigate them.\\n\\nThere are courses on Lynda to teach you\\nall about pivot tables.\\nPart three of BPR is can any steps be combined into one\\nand done by one person instead of two?\\nFor example, if one person can do part one and part two\\nof the job then you save the transfer time\\nand more importantly, the time queuing for person two\\nwho probably has a load of other jobs to do\\nbefore they get to yours.\\nCan the person who receives the phone call\\nalso be the one who sorts out the problem?\\nCan the designer also be the buyer\\nof the parts that they designed?\\nCan the machine operator also do the packing\\nof their work?\\nI'm amazed that there are still lawyers out there\\nwho dictate emails to their secretaries.\\n\\nYou might be able to think of examples\\nin your systems where stages could be combined,\\nthus cutting out one transfer and one queue.\\nEven if person two was much quicker\\nat doing your job, it would still probably be faster\\nfor person one to do it all then having to wait\\nfor person two to get around to yours.\\nAnd the fourth part of BPR is can any\\nsteps be done in parallel, rather than one after another?\\nWhen I moved house, everything had to be done\\none step at a time which took ages.\\n\\nThey wouldn't risk doing anything at the same time\\nin case, say the money didn't come through\\nand then the legal work was wasted.\\nEven when I told them I wanted to take that risk.\\nIt was really frustrating, but then I guessed that\\nthey felt that their time was more important\\nthan mine.\\nThey weren't bothered about the overall lead time\\nof the whole process of buying the house.\\nAnd I guessed they were making sure that the\\ncost was kept down, having seen all the problems before.\\nBut I felt that they should distinguish between\\nthe two types of customer.\\n\\nThe ones who wanted it cheap, and the ones\\nlike me that wanted it quickly.\\nAnd I personally would have been prepared\\nto risk paying more to get it through quicker.\\nSo reducing the number of steps, or doing\\nsome of them in parallel, is the first way\\nto get something through more quickly.\\nAnd it also often has the benefit of saving you money too\\nif you get rid of unnecessary steps or can automate them.\\nIn some manufacturing companies this has been\\ntaken to the extreme of what are known\\nas production cells.\\n\\nVolvo did a famous experiment where a team of people\\nmade the whole car from start to finish instead\\nof a conventional flow line where you just\\nput on the wheels and pass it on.\\nAnd although they were a bit slower\\nat doing the whole assembly then specialists\\nwould have been, they saved on transfer\\nand waiting time.\\nThe car was being worked on the whole time.\\nAnd also the team really cared about that car,\\nso quality was improved.\\nSo in the idea of a production cell,\\na small group of people often sitting or standing\\nin a U-shape, and by the way, they're on\\nthe inside of the U of tables so they can\\nswap around and help each other,\\nthey process a job from the start to the finish,\\nso they get to be a team and the job gets worked on\\nmore or less without touching the ground,\\nand comes out at the other end really quickly.\\n\\nAnd you don't even have to worry about\\ngetting a balanced line because if one operation\\ntakes five minutes and the next takes 20 minutes\\nit's okay because the people swap around and they\\nhelp each other, so nobody ends up having\\nto stand around idle.\\nSo you might want to think about setting up\\nsome cells, particularly if you have families\\nof similar items that have to be assembled\\nby groups of people.\\nA final thought is that the office example\\nof a cell is a meeting.\\nWhilst it's not always brilliantly efficient for each\\nindividual person, we sometimes have to sit through\\nan agenda item which doesn't effect us,\\nor our input is only very brief, it's very\\nefficient for the task under consideration.\\n\\nBecause instead of being passed from one desk\\nto the next for weeks, it gets put on the table\\nand dealt with by everyone in a few minutes, job done.\\nSo there's the same trade-off between\\nindividual efficiency and getting jobs processed\\nwithin a short lead time.\\nSo it would certainly be a good idea\\nto draw out your processes and review them.\\nCan any steps be removed, computerized,\\ncombined into one or done in parallel,\\nand maybe some of your processes would\\nbenefit from being made into their own separate\\nproduction cell.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:451921\",\"duration\":492,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Understanding balanced lines and

I mentioned balanced lines in the last section.\\nI want to explain what those are\\nand show you some of the options using an example.\\nImagine this is how you get\\nyour lunch in the office dining room.\\nAnd by the way, I've provided a printable version\\nin the exercise files, which you might\\nwant to refer to throughout this video.\\nSomeone serves you your soup, which takes 20 seconds.\\nThen you move along to the meat counter,\\nwhere it takes them 30 seconds to cut you off a nice piece.\\nAnd then it takes 20 seconds to get your vegetables,\\nand then 15 and 10 seconds for one server\\nto give you both your dessert and your drink.\\n\\nAnd then it takes a minute to pay for it all.\\nHave a look at the diagram for a moment,\\nand then see if you can tell me\\nhow many lunches can this setup can serve per hour.\\nNow people often find this a difficult question,\\nand they get bogged down with a calculator\\nworking out lots of sums, but actually,\\nthis question illustrates a really important\\nand simple idea: what's the bottleneck of the system?\\nThe cashier is the slowest part and\\ncan only process 60 people per hour.\\n\\nSo whatever the others do, that's the number\\nof people you're going to be able to serve.\\nIt's simple.\\nSo what's the bottleneck for your work?\\nWe'll look at bottlenecks in more detail\\nin the next section, including how to find them.\\nNow the next question, which is also related\\nto the bottleneck is as follows.\\nIf you were the manager, what could\\nyou do to improve the above setup\\nwithout spending any money on equipment or extra people?\\nBy the way, self-service is not allowed.\\nYou must maintain portion control.\\n\\nAgain, it looks hard, but if you focus\\non the bottleneck, then the answer is clear.\\nThere's no point in doing anything\\nfaster than the bottleneck.\\nIt's a waste of capacity,\\nso get rid of anything faster than the bottleneck.\\nThis means you can redeploy\\ntwo of the people and run it with just three.\\nThey can still serve all the food within\\nthe rate of one person a minute, which is the speed\\nthey're going through the cashier.\\nBut of course, if you have more demand than\\none person per minute, it would be better\\nto serve the extra customers, and this means\\nspeeding up the bottleneck.\\n\\nSo let's suppose that you could have two cashiers.\\nHow many people could you serve per hour now?\\nAnd the answer is easy.\\nYou could now put a person through every 30 seconds,\\nwhich is 120 people per hour.\\nFor just the cost of the one extra cashier,\\nyou're selling an extra 60 lunches.\\nIf meals cost, say, 10 dollars,\\nthat's another 600 dollars you're getting.\\nThis illustrates the principle that working\\non the bottleneck is really valuable\\nsince it freeze up the whole system.\\n\\nI wonder how you could apply that concept.\\nNow one final question.\\nGoing back to our original setup,\\nhow long will it take you to get your lunch?\\nThis looks easy, but it's actually\\na really hard question.\\nIn fact, I'd like you to just pause this video\\nand see if you can come up with the answer.\\nPlease do actually try it.\\nHow good would you feel if you get the right answer?\\nOkay, welcome back.\\nI wonder what answer you came up with.\\nNow this question brings together the\\nbottleneck idea, with the idea of queues.\\n\\nAnd it's worth understanding, because\\nI think it's a microcosm of any operation\\nincluding probably yours.\\nThere are three ways to look at the question\\nof how long it takes to get your lunch.\\nThe first way is from the point of view\\nof the first person into the dining room.\\nSo they just go through all the stages, and it's a total of\\ntwo minutes 35 seconds to get served.\\nBut I don't really care about them\\nbecause they're a special case.\\nWhat about everyone else?\\nIt's not the same for them.\\n\\nSo the second way to look at the problem\\nis to imagine a conveyor belt.\\nEveryone moves along once per minute.\\nThis is what happens when your trays are all\\nsliding along on some rails.\\nIt takes you 20 seconds to get your soup,\\nbut you have to wait a whole minute\\nbefore you can move along to the meat\\nbecause all the trays are waiting for the\\ncashier to hurry up and serve their person.\\nBasically we all move along once a minute.\\nSo it takes a minute for the soup,\\na minute for the meat, another for the veg,\\nanother for the dessert and drinks,\\nand a final one for the cashier.\\n\\nThat's a total of five minutes to get your lunch.\\nIt's slightly annoying to have to wait\\nfor the queue to shuffle along, but there's no point\\nin serving out more meat than one piece per minute,\\nsince the cashier won't be able to cope.\\nNow the third way of thinking about this problem\\nof how long it'll take to get your lunch\\nis to ask, \\\"But what if there were islands?\\\"\\nWhat if you could go to the soup island, have some soup,\\nand then go to the meat island,\\nwhere there might be a bit of a queue, et cetera,\\nfinally ending up at the cashier,\\nwho also has their own island?\\nThis is important because it's just the same\\nas different offices or departments,\\nwith jobs flowing between them.\\n\\nAnd just look what happens.\\nIt takes 20 seconds to get your soup.\\nSo three people per minute are getting soup,\\nand then they're going over to the meat island.\\nNow, only two people per minute are being\\nserved at the meat island because it takes\\n30 seconds to do the meat.\\nSo the queue at the meat island gets longer\\nat a rate of one person per minute.\\nAnd they arrive at the cashier at two per minute,\\nhaving got through the meat island\\nand the soup and the drinks and things.\\nAnd then, only one per minute gets served\\nby the cashier, so the queue\\ngets longer at the cashier as well.\\n\\nAfter 10 minutes, you've got 10 people queuing up\\nat the meat island, which means five minutes of waiting time\\nto get their meat, and you've got 10 people also\\nqueuing at the cashier, which means waiting here\\nanother 10 minutes, which is 15 minutes\\nwaiting in total plus the serving times.\\nBy the time you get through the cashier,\\nyou'll have cold soup.\\nThis is exactly the same as jobs piling up\\nin the accounts department,\\nor people queuing for airport security.\\nThe queues can get really long.\\n\\nSo islands are good if some people want to\\nmiss out the meat or the vegetables,\\nbut they can lead to uncontrolled queues and delays.\\nWhile the conveyor belt forces\\nthe slowest point to hurry up.\\nEveryone's looking at the slowest point,\\nin this example, the cashier.\\nAnd in a work context, management or maybe\\nthe people who are being held up\\ncould go and help out.\\nAnd this is one of the principles of just in time\\nand pull systems, which we'll come to a little bit later.\\n\\nSo the three main conclusions from this example are:\\nnumber one, you can easily work out how much\\nthe system can deliver by just looking at the bottleneck.\\nIn this case, the cashier.\\nNumber two: the bottleneck limits\\nthe throughput, so either you plan everything\\nto go at that speed or you speed up the bottleneck.\\nAnd if you spend a little more on the bottleneck,\\nyou can get a lot more from the whole system.\\nIn our case, it only costs maybe an extra 10 dollars an hour\\nfor a second cashier, but we served an extra 60 meals,\\nwhich gained us 600 dollars.\\n\\nIt pays to look after that bottleneck.\\nMore about this in the next section.\\nAnd thirdly, finally, the time spent in the system is\\njust as important to think about\\nas the quantity coming through.\\nYou don't want your lunch to be cold by the time\\nyou pay for it, and similarly, in an organization,\\nyou don't want to have lost your customer\\nby the time you quote a price\\nor deliver a product or service.\\nSo we need to look at queues and lead times as well.\\nAnd we'll do that in a later section of this course.\\n\\nSo as usual, I'd like you to ask yourself\\nwhether you have balanced flow through your processes,\\nwhether you have an obvious bottleneck,\\nwhere the queues of stuff either physical or jobs\\nin people's inboxes, sometimes build up,\\nand whether the throughput time might be\\ntoo long in some of your processes.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:451922\",\"duration\":330,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Improving time performance:

In the lunch line example in the previous section,\\nwe saw how the cashier was the bottleneck\\nand that spotting that fact\\nand then improving the cashier's throughput\\nmade all the difference.\\nThis idea of bottlenecks first appeared in the 1980s\\nwhen a book called The Goal came out.\\nIt was written by Eli Goldratt,\\nand it blew everyone's minds, including mine.\\nIt's still easy to get hold of,\\nand I would urge you to get it and read it.\\nHidden in a fun story were some\\nreally radical new ideas about how\\nbottlenecks are incredibly important to identify,\\nand then how to manage them.\\n\\nI'm going to cover his main points\\nin this short section of the course.\\nHis first point is that you can't make more\\nthan the bottleneck can handle.\\nSo if you know the bottleneck,\\nyou know how much you can produce,\\nwhatever else is going on in your factory or office.\\nAnd therefore, if you can increase the capacity\\nof the bottleneck, you can increase the capacity\\nof the whole system.\\nSo spending money on the bottleneck\\nis really worth doing, while spending money\\non non-bottleneck areas is a complete waste.\\n\\nIn my lunch line example,\\nif we doubled the speed of the cashier,\\nwe could serve twice as many meals,\\nwhich is the output of the whole system.\\nWell, serving soup faster would be\\na complete waste of investment\\nif the cashier is still limiting the number of people\\nwho can come through.\\nLots of subtle ideas flow from this bottleneck idea,\\nand here are three.\\nFirstly, there's no point in pushing in more\\nthan the bottleneck can handle into your system.\\n\\nOtherwise, work or people will just pile up\\ninside your system.\\nYou can use this knowledge to schedule\\nthe import of work or materials.\\nYou can also use it to schedule what's gonna\\ncome out of the system.\\nIf the bottleneck is processing 10 per day,\\nthen you know that 10 per day\\nwill be coming out of the whole system a bit later.\\nThere can't be more than 10 coming out.\\nAnd there won't be less, either.\\nIf there's a temporary delay downstream,\\nthey can catch up the day after\\nand get back the average of 10.\\n\\nThe second concept that comes out of bottlenecks\\nis that time lost at non-bottlenecks isn't really lost\\nbecause they can catch up,\\nas long as they don't affect the bottleneck itself.\\nSo ideally, you'd have a buffer of work\\nin front of the bottleneck so that it never\\nruns out of work to do.\\nThen any problems upstream don't matter,\\nas it keeps working on its buffer.\\nAnd problems downstream similarly don't matter.\\nSay you can make 10 a day at the bottleneck,\\nbut ahead of it they can make 20,\\nand downstream they can also process 20.\\n\\nIt's obvious they can lose easily half a day\\neither before or after, and things will be fine.\\nAnd if there's a buffer of say 40 at the bottleneck,\\nthen the upstream people can have a breakdown\\nfor four days and still catch up later.\\nSo you'd focus your management effort\\non making sure that the bottleneck never breaks down,\\nnever runs out of things to work on,\\nand is never supplied with any parts or materials\\nthat are already defective.\\nThe third important concept that comes out of\\nbottleneck theory is avoid having any operations\\nthat are resourced significantly higher than the bottleneck\\nbecause this is just waste.\\n\\nWhat they make will never get through the bottleneck.\\nBut similarly, don't reduce them down\\nto exactly the same as the bottleneck,\\notherwise you've got two.\\nAnd if you get rid of the bottleneck,\\nthen you'll have to look for the next lowest\\nproduction area.\\nThere will always be a bottleneck in any system.\\nWhat's yours?\\nBut how to find your bottleneck,\\nwell, there are three ways.\\nFirst, calculate the hours required at each stage\\nto cope with the total throughput\\nand see if you have enough capacity at each stage.\\n\\nFor example, if it takes one minute\\nto put the wheels on the car\\nand we make 600 cars a day,\\ndo we have 600 minutes, that's 10 hours,\\nof people available at the wheel putting on stage?\\nAnd the second way to find your bottleneck,\\na much simpler way, is to look for where the queues are.\\nIf there's a queue for the photocopier,\\nthen that might be the bottleneck for your office.\\nOr if the booking in clock has a pile\\nof paper on their desk,\\nthey might be your bottleneck.\\n\\nAnd of course it's criminal if one of\\nyour cheapest resources is in fact\\nstrangling the output of the whole operation.\\nThe third way to find the bottleneck is\\nthat when you've got multiple products\\nand multiple parts through the system,\\nlook at what tends to be late,\\nand then find out where those items\\nare getting held up,\\nand this is probably going to be your bottleneck.\\nThen you can do the calculation I mentioned above\\nto check whether you have the required capacity.\\nAnd finally, what can you do about your bottleneck?\\nWell, the main thing is to look after it.\\n\\nPut your best people on it.\\nMeasure any downtime and reduce it.\\nKeep a buffer of work in front of it.\\nAnd consider investing in a second bit of equipment\\nor another person, remembering that the cost\\nis worth it if it gets you extra output\\nfrom the whole system.\\nImagine if fitting four more wheels an hour\\nmeans that you can make and sell\\na whole extra car per hour.\\nSo what's the bottleneck in your office\\nor department or factory?\\nAnd how can you get more stuff through it?\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:451923\",\"duration\":515,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Improving time

We've seen that queues are the\\nmain cause of long lead time.\\nAnd, they will build up in front of the bottle neck,\\nso you need to address that.\\nBut, what about when you have enough capacity?\\nWhat happens then?\\nHere's an example.\\nClearly, if you can serve ten people in an hour,\\nand you've got 12 people an hour arriving,\\nthen the queue is going to get longer and longer\\nby an average of two people per hour.\\nAfter 20 hours, the queue will be 40 people\\nand you don't want that.\\n\\nBut, what if you can serve ten people in an hour\\nand you only have eight people arriving?\\nSurely that's going to be fine, isn't it?\\nI want to show you that actually, it isn't\\nand that you're still going to get queues building up\\neven though it looks as if you should be fine.\\nIn fact, it can be predicted that you'll have\\nan average queue length of four in this case.\\nBut, before we get into calculating the size of the queue,\\nlet's just think about how on Earth queues can build up\\nwhen you can serve ten people an hour\\nand you've only got eight arriving.\\n\\nThis is because the eight people\\nwon't arrive evenly spaced.\\nSo, you'll get several at once, which is a queue\\nand then you'll have a gap.\\nDuring this gap, after you've got rid of the queue,\\nyou're not serving anyone, so you're\\nlosing capacity and your ability to serve\\nten people per hour is reducing to maybe only seven.\\nSo, problem number one is fluctuating arrival rates.\\nYou will also have fluctuating service rates\\nbecause sometimes it will only take four or five\\nminutes to serve somebody while sometimes\\nit will take seven or eight minutes to serve them.\\n\\nSo, the seven minute people reduce your overall output,\\nand then when you get a person who needs only five minutes,\\nafter them you'll have a gap when you're wasting capacity,\\nyour employees just sitting around.\\nSo, that's more wasted capacity\\nor reduced capacity effectively.\\nSo, that's the other reason why\\nyou're not going to achieve the maximum\\npossible people served per hour.\\nWhen you're planning the amount of capacity\\nwe need in order to give a good service to our customers,\\nwe can't just work out the number per hour on average.\\n\\nIt won't be enough.\\nWe need to think about how much spare\\ncapacity we need to have in order to cope\\nwith these fluctuations in arrival and service rates.\\nLuckily, there's a really neat little formula\\nwhich tells us how much extra capacity we need.\\nThe formula tells us that the\\nQueue length = Utilization/ (1-Utilization).\\nIf we're using percentages for the utilization,\\nso we're saying 75% of the time they're working\\ninstead of their 3/4 utilized,\\nthe formula which predicts the queue length\\nwill be U/ (100 - U).\\n\\nDon't panic, it's only maths.\\nIf I take you through a couple of examples,\\nyou'll see that this formula is very easy to use,\\nand it's completely brilliant and it's an amazing thing\\nbecause it applies to everything in the world\\nor at least every situation where\\nwork is arriving at a random rate\\nand you still need to serve the customer\\nreasonably quickly which is pretty much every situation.\\nLet's take the example of an\\nIT help desk customer service line\\nwhere it takes seven and a half\\nminutes to deal with the call.\\n\\nSo, on average, you should be able to serve\\neight people an hour.\\nAnd, say you have 64 calls an hour coming in.\\nSo, that would mean, on the face of it\\nyou'll expect to need eight people in your system\\nin order to cope with the demand.\\nBut, as we've already seen,\\nthere will be times when you're wasting\\ncapacity because there isn't any demand.\\nSo, you actually won't serve eight per hour.\\nBut, on average, you do have 64 per hour arriving.\\nSo, the queue in this situation\\nis going to get longer and longer and longer.\\n\\nWe need some spare capacity in order to keep\\nthe queues down, but how much?\\nSuppose you have ten people instead of\\nthe original eight that we thought was enough.\\nWill that be enough?\\nWell, let's look at the formula.\\nFirst, we need to know our utilization.\\nWell, we've got ten people doing the work of eight.\\nSo, our ten people are only going to be 80% utilized.\\nThe formula tells us that the queue length\\nwill then be U/(100-U) which is\\n80/ (100-80) which is 20.\\n\\nSo, 80/20 which equals a queue of 4.\\nSince we know it's taking about seven minutes\\nto serve somebody, then the queue of 4\\nmeans that you'll be waiting 28 minutes\\nand that's probably too long\\nalthough it sounds like a typical\\nhelp line waiting time to me.\\nNow, suppose we still have 64 calls coming in per hour\\nand we have ten people and then one of them leaves\\nand the ambitious manager thinks,\\n\\\"Hmmm, well we did it with ten staff and they had\\n20% of their time wasted. So let's just\\nleave it at nine people and get them to work\\na bit harder and save some money.\\\"\\nWhat happens to our system?\\nWell, utilization is now about 90% instead of 80%.\\n\\nAnd the formula then tells us that the queue lengths\\nwill be 90/10 which equals 9 people in the queue.\\nSo, with seven minutes per call,\\nyou would be waiting 63 minutes, over an hour.\\nSo, the small saving in cost this manager has made\\nhas resulted in much worse service.\\nThe queue length has been doubled\\nand is now unacceptably long.\\nAnd you can see that if he pushes the so called\\nefficiency of the process up to 95%,\\nthe queues become 95/5 which is about 19\\nwhich times seven minutes is over 2 hours.\\n\\nI think it's 133 minutes of waiting time.\\nSo, how many people serving would we need\\nin order to get the queuing time down to almost nothing?\\nWell, we know that 80% give you 80/20\\nwhich is a queue of four,\\n75% utilization gives you 75/25 which is a queue of 3,\\n67% utilization gives you a queue of 2,\\nand 50% give you 50/ (100-50) which is 50/50\\nwhich is a queue of one.\\n\\nBy the way, that one is you being served.\\nSo, in order to give instant service, you need\\ndouble the resource you would expect.\\nHave you ever checked into an expensive hotel\\nand there were two people behind the desk\\nand you're not sure which one to talk to,\\nnot wanting to insult the one that you don't choose?\\nWell, that's why expensive hotels cost about twice as much.\\nBecause they have double the staff,\\nso that the customers never have to wait for anything.\\nSo, managers want utilization to be 80% or higher\\nbecause they don't want to be wasting lots of cost,\\nbut customers want queues to be only one or two.\\n\\nYou can see on the chart that these don't overlap.\\nEither the customer has to pay more\\nfor the luxury of more staff or\\nthey have to live with queues resulting from fewer staff.\\nAnd, managers have to choose between\\nwasting resources in order to give great service\\nand charging for that or they need to live with\\nunhappy customers while they keep their costs down.\\nThis is a law of nature and\\nit really does apply to everything;\\nhelp lines, petrol pumps, doctors waiting rooms,\\nqueuing to get into sports stadiums, airports,\\nburger restaurants, paying at the till in shops,\\nreception desks, everything.\\n\\nAnd the big message is that you mustn't\\njust calculate how much capacity you'll need\\nbased on 100% performance.\\nYou must do this and then add between\\n20% and 100% depending on the speed of service you want to\\ngive your customers and charge them accordingly for that.\\nProcess improvement doesn't just mean cutting your\\nresources to the bone because that will have the\\ncollateral effect of making your service times much worse.\\nSo, I want you to think about this for your own processes.\\n\\nWhere do you have variable arrival rates?\\nWhere do you have queues?\\nAnd should you increase your capacity\\nin order to reduce those queues?\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:451924\",\"duration\":492,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Reducing lead time using a pull approach to

We've already seen the queues are inevitable\\nunless you have spare capacity which is expensive.\\nAnd if you have lots of different components\\nmoving through a factory with lots of machines\\nmaybe each component takes a different route,\\nspends different amounts of time\\nat each machine that it visits\\nand you're bound to have queues in some places.\\nAnd one approach to handling all these\\nwill be to have an incredibly clever computer\\nwhich knows everything and it would work out the best way\\nto push everything through the factory or the office.\\n\\nBut even now with all our computing power\\nthis problem hasn't really been solved mathematically.\\nAnd of course, as soon as something changes,\\nthe whole thing has to be recalculated.\\nSo the best approach is probably to simplify the problem\\nin one of two ways.\\nOne is as we've seen earlier,\\nto focus only on the bottleneck of your system,\\nbut the other, is to use pull systems\\nand that's what this section is about.\\nWhat is a pull system and how can you use one?\\nWell the basic idea is that you don't produce any work\\nthat the next person in the chain can't cope with.\\n\\nBuying food from a supermarket\\nor ordering books from the internet are both pull systems\\nbecause you buy more at the rate that suits you.\\nImagine if the supermarket automatically delivered food\\nat a fixed rate, regardless of whether you wanted more.\\nIf you're on a diet, the food would just pile up,\\nwith more being delivered everyday, it would be madness!\\nBut this is exactly what happens\\nwith your email inbox, and with the post.\\nAnd with most factories where the job is done\\nand passed to the next department\\nregardless of whether they're going slowly or are ill\\nor are on holiday.\\n\\nSo the idea of a pull system\\nis that you stop the upstream person from making the work\\nunless the downstream person can cope with it.\\nTwo easy ways to do this are as follows:\\nthe first is to have an ordering system,\\nlike we do with the supermarket.\\nThe second person sends a message to the first person saying\\n\\\"Make more!\\\" or \\\"Deliver more!\\\"\\nSometimes this message is in the form of a little card,\\nsometimes known as a kanban card,\\nwhich has the part number and quantity required.\\n\\nLater the parts are delivered\\nby the first person with the card,\\nand the second person can then use the card again\\nto reorder when they need another batch.\\nMaybe the card is stuck on the front of the transport box\\nto show what the parts are\\nor maybe it's left in the bottom of the box\\nso that you can reorder easily\\nwhen you get to the bottom of all the parts\\nand the box is empty.\\nMaybe the card is put three from the bottom,\\nso that you will reorder when you've still got three left\\nto keep you going while you wait for the next batch.\\n\\nBut the main thing is,\\nthat you can't ever have more in the system\\nthan the number on the card\\nor the number of boxes in the system.\\nAnd Person 1 can't make anything until the card arrives.\\nSome systems have lots of these kanban cards circulating,\\nso Person 1 may have several cards asking for work\\nfor different things to be made\\nfor number of different Person 2's\\nand indeed, Person 2 might have a number of Person 1's\\nwho supply them.\\nBut it's a simple system and it still works\\neven if you have lots of people supplying lots of people.\\n\\nThe other way to communicate the requirement\\nand to keep the buffer down,\\nis to have a storage area in between the two people\\nso that Person 2 takes their work from there\\nand Person 1 can only produce more\\nwhen there's space in the buffer.\\nThis means, that if Person 2 stops for any reason,\\nPerson 1 must stop as well.\\nI know this doesn't sound good, but actually it is.\\nRemember, there's no point in Person 1 making more\\nthan Person 2 needs.\\nInstead, Person 1 should go and help Person 2.\\n\\nThis is an interesting and subtle extra benefit\\nof keeping the stock down with the Pull System.\\nBecause there's only a small buffer between them,\\nthe two people are closely linked,\\nand so they have to work much more as a team.\\nWith the push system, Person 1 doesn't really care\\nhow Person 2 is doing, he just makes more.\\nPerson 2 could even be dead\\nand Person 1 would still continue\\njust making stuff and sending it off.\\nBut with this pull system, there won't be any orders\\nfrom Person 2, so Person 1 rapidly runs out of things to do,\\nwill have to go and investigate and offer to help\\nif Person 2 is struggling.\\n\\nSimilarly if Person 1 has a problem,\\nthen Person 2 will run out of materials\\nand will have to go and see\\nif Person 1 is okay and offer to help.\\nSo you get much better teamwork\\nand better balancing of capacity.\\nIn factories, this work storage area\\nis often in between the two production areas.\\nAnd in the case of Just In Time,\\nthe external supply comes in,\\nand looks on the shelf and refills any that need refilling,\\nbut only supplies the parts where there is a need for them.\\nThis saves all the paperwork of reordering,\\nbut it does mean that the supply needs to be able to supply\\nor make any part at short notice.\\n\\nGoing back to my email example,\\na pull system would mean that you couldn't email someone\\nif they already had more than say, 20 emails in their inbox.\\nThat would be interesting.\\nYou'd have to either go and help them with their workload,\\nor you'd email one of your other colleagues\\nwho had space in their inbox\\nwhich actually might be a good way to work.\\nIf you have a choice of people to email,\\nwhy contact the one who's already snowed under with work?\\nOnce the pull system is working,\\nand people are replenishing the buffer smoothly,\\nyou can then slowly start to reduce the buffers.\\n\\nI like to think of this in terms of wrinkly apples.\\nImagine if I have 20 apples in my kitchen,\\nand I eat one a day,\\nand when I get down to 10,\\nthe supermarket delivers another pack of 10.\\nIt's quite a good system because I've always got apples.\\nBut the problem is, that I'm eating apples\\nthat are always 20 days old.\\nSo maybe the supermarket should not deliver for 10 days\\nso that I could run my stock down.\\nAnd then work a system where they send me another pack of 10\\nwhen I'm down to just one apple.\\n\\nYou can see that the next step would be\\nfor the supermarket to deliver smaller quantities.\\nIn the ideal world, I'd be down to just one apple,\\nand they

would mean\\nI only had one or two apples in the house at all times\\nand they would always be fresh and crunchy.\\nBut it does mean complete reliability\\nof supermarket delivery, and also constant usage by me.\\n\\nUnlike the old system of 20 in stock,\\nwhere they could deliver early or late,\\nand I could eat no apples for a week\\nand then have five in one go, it didn't matter.\\nSo just a recap, why would we want to stop Person 1\\nmaking stuff when Person 2 can't cope with the supply rate?\\nThe main reason is that you end up\\nwith lots of work in progress,\\nwhich needs space and increases the lead time,\\nas staff has to queue for Person 2,\\n20 days in the case of my wrinkly apples.\\n\\nAnd then there's a more subtle reason,\\nthat it hides problems.\\nPerson 1 can be very variable in their deliveries,\\nor might be making 10% defective work,\\nbut Person 2 can just sort through it\\nand pick out the good ones.\\nOr maybe Person 2 has a variable consumption rate,\\nbut that too would be hidden by the buffer between them.\\nWith no buffer, or a very small buffer,\\nthey have to get everything right: quality, speed\\nand communication, which should therefore lead to\\nlower costs and increased quality\\nas well as faster throughput.\\n\\nSo what are the push parts of your processes?\\nAnd could you change any of them over to a pull system?\\nEither with reordering cards\\nor with reduced work storage areas.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:451925\",\"duration\":402,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Thinking about your batch

We've seen earlier that smaller batches\\nlead to less stock or less work in progress\\nand all the benefits that come with that.\\nBut of course, the reason we make things in batches\\nis to save the setting up cost.\\nIf it takes you an hour to set up the machine\\nand then you can make one part every second,\\nhow many would you make in a batch?\\nActually, before I tell you the answer,\\njust think for a moment and decide\\nhow many you would make in your batch.\\nAn hour to set the machine up,\\nand then it makes one per second.\\n\\nMost people say an hour's worth,\\nwhich would be 3,600.\\nHaving the production time\\nthe same as the setting up time is a tempting\\nrough rule of thumb, but it's probably wrong.\\nFor a start, do you really want 3,600?\\nWhat if you only use one a month?\\nThen you've just made 300 years' worth.\\nMuch better to spend the hour setting up\\nand then just make 12.\\nSo the usage rate must affect how many you make.\\n\\nWhat else would affect how many you make?\\nWell, the other factor would be storage cost.\\nIf we're talking sofas, then you don't want\\n3,000 of them sitting around.\\nIf they're nails, then you probably could\\njust have that many just in a box.\\nSo there's a formula called the EBQ\\nor Economic Batch Quantity,\\nwhich was first worked out 100 years ago\\nand says that you should make the square root\\nof two times the annual usage\\ntimes the setup cost\\ndivided by the annual storage cost per unit.\\n\\nBizarrely, the production cost doesn't come into it.\\nWhether they take one second or one hour to make\\ndoesn't affect the formula.\\nBut don't spend too much time learning this formula\\nbecause a lot of people nowadays don't think\\nit's relevant anymore.\\nThe current thinking is not to say\\nsetting up takes ages, so we'll have to\\nmake a big batch, but to stand it on its head\\nand say why is the setup time so long?\\nOnce you have the idea that setting up time\\ncould be reduced, maybe right down to almost nothing,\\nit changes everything.\\n\\nOn TV I saw some people change a car engine in 58 seconds.\\nThey drove it into the studio,\\nuncoupled the engine, lifted it out,\\nput a new one in, and drove the car out of the studio\\nin under a minute.\\nSo why does it take a whole hour to change jobs\\non a milling machine or to change the tools\\non an injection molder?\\nIf you film people doing it, which, by the way,\\nthey might not like if you don't involve them\\nin the purpose of the project,\\nyou'll see that they can't find the spanner,\\nthey have to go and fetch equipment,\\nsomething breaks, they can't lift something,\\nthey have to find a pallet truck,\\nit takes five goes to get the adjustment right,\\net cetera, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd all of these things could be streamlined,\\nso it's like changing the tires on a racing car.\\nBy the way, racing cars have whole replacement wheels\\nwith new tires already fitted ready to swap over.\\nAnd this principle can be used a lot.\\nYou have a whole replaceable unit ready to swap over,\\nwhatever it is that you're changing.\\nThe unit can be adjusted and set beforehand,\\nso it's ready to just click into place.\\nToyota first started this in the 1960s and called it SMED,\\nSingle-Minute Exchange of Dies.\\n\\nBut the concept is still as important today as it was then.\\nIf you can save time changing over between batches,\\nyou save much more than just that time.\\nYou gain the ability to make smaller batches efficiently,\\nwhich saves you space and lead time\\nthroughout your whole process.\\nThis is exactly the same with the things you buy.\\nThere is an almost identical formula called EOQ,\\nEconomic Order Quantity, which tells you in theory\\nhow many you should buy at a time.\\nAnd as before, it's based on the usage,\\nthe ordering cost, and the storage cost,\\nbut weirdly, not the cost to buy each item.\\n\\nAgain, the point is that rather than worrying about this,\\nthe first question to ask is why can't we get a system\\nwhere things can be ordered and delivered\\nin smaller quantities?\\nDigital printing has meant that books can be printed\\nin much smaller quantities,\\nmaybe even just one book.\\nAnd now, 3D digital printers are making it possible\\nto make just one thing without any shipping costs\\nbecause it'll be made in your own home.\\nEven though it costs more to make,\\nthe saving on shipping, et cetera,\\nmakes it worth doing, in some cases, at least.\\n\\nAnd if everyone is ordering smaller quantities,\\nit can still work, in fact, it works better\\nbecause instead of the daily delivering van\\nvisiting one how in your road each day\\nand delivering 100 items,\\nit could visit each of the 20 houses in the road\\nand deliver five items to each one of them each day.\\nStill 100 items for the van to carry,\\nbut a much smoother flow, and so\\nsmaller batches can be delivered for the same cost.\\nEven in offices you get batching of work\\nbecause changeover always has a cost.\\n\\nDoes the person who processes invoices\\nstore up a week's worth and then do them\\nin one load on Fridays?\\nCould they do them every day\\nso that suppliers don't have to wait a week for payment?\\nAnd purchasing is often centralized with the aim\\nof buying things more cheaply.\\nThis is equivalent to batching it together,\\nand it has hidden costs of waiting and administering\\nas well as lack of detailed knowledge\\nof what they're buying.\\nFrom lunches to car, from mops to hotel rooms,\\nevery central purchasing arrangement\\nthat I've ever seen ends up paying more than it did before.\\n\\nTry doing a bit of negotiation yourself with that supplier.\\nSee if you can't get it cheaper\\nthan the purchasing department.\\nSo the moral of this section is that reducing\\nsetting up time saves you much more\\nthan just that little bit of time.\\nIt makes it possible to make smaller batches,\\nwhich in turn reduces your lead time\\nand your stock holding costs.\\nAnd formulas like EBQ and EOQ,\\nthe economic batch and order quantities,\\nbecome irrelevant at last.\\nEverything flows from this one idea\\nof quicker changeover, quicker setting up.\\n\\nSo the question I'd like you to ponder after all this\\nis what do you have that's in batches,\\nwhether it's things you buy, things you make,\\nor things that you do?\\nAnd could those batches be made smaller?\\nAnd if it means that the setting up becomes\\ntoo time consuming, don't give up, but ask yourself,\\nhow can you reduce your setup time?\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:451926\",\"duration\":176,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Improving quality and cost

 \\n If so, they are doing this work on an ongoing basis,  \\n looking for ways to improve processes  \\n and not supporting a specific project.  \\n The term change initiative, therefore, reminds us  \\n that strategy analysis work happens  \\n beyond the project space.  \\n The second term is business need.  \\n The business need is a problem or opportunity  \\n of strategic or tactical importance.  \\n Think about your last project.  \\n What problem or opportunity  \\n was your business wrestling with?  \\n Lost revenue, cost increases, whatever the business  \\n was looking to address, this was your business need.  \\n Business needs establish  \\n why the change initiative is important.  \\n For example, a sponsor might identify the need  \\n to address inefficiencies in processing customer orders,  \\n or a senior executive might have a need to integrate  \\n the operations from a newly acquired business.  \\n Alongside the business need, we can write business goals  \\n and objectives to explain what we want to do  \\n to accomplish the business need.  \\n Goals are high level statements,  \\n while objectives are more detailed and measurable.  \\n For example, a business goal might be  \\n to address inefficiencies in processing customer orders,  \\n while the business objective would be  \\n to improve processing time by 30%.  \\n Now, in order to define the business needs,  \\n goals and objectives, you'll have to understand aspects  \\n of the current environment.  \\n This is what we call the current state.  \\n It can be called the as-is environment.  \\n But either way, it's the business environment today.  \\n It's made up of existing capabilities, such as processes,  \\n products, services, people, IT systems, just to name a few.  \\n Current state understanding is good,  \\n but we're making changes so we're transforming  \\n the current state.  \\n We're going to the future.  \\n The future state, also known as the to-be environment,  \\n is the desired business environment  \\n after the proposed changes are made.  \\n For example, if we successfully implement  \\n a new commercial off-the-shelf software package,  \\n the future state reflects  \\n what the business environment looks like  \\n once the software package implements.  \\n Finally, the last term, change strategy.  \\n A change strategy is a plan to move the current state  \\n to the future state to achieve  \\n the desired business objectives.  \\n It's your explanation of the major activities  \\n needing to take place to transition the business  \\n into its future state.  \\n You might come up with a few change strategies,  \\n but there'll be a preferred change strategy  \\n that is explained in detail so it's clear  \\n how the business transformation will happen.  \\n Remember, establishing common terms with your team  \\n will facilitate a much smoother adoption of the practices.  \\n As you start to establish strategy analysis practices  \\n in your organization, bring along the key terms  \\n and start using them as a team.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

Many times in business,  \\n bad decisions are the result  \\n of making incorrect assumptions.  \\n It happens all the time,  \\n especially when identifying the root cause  \\n for a business problem.  \\n But how do you improve your skills  \\n to accurately identify root causes?  \\n There are actually a number of techniques you can use.  \\n Root cause analysis is a problem-solving approach used  \\n to discover the underlying cause  \\n of why problems exist in the first place.  \\n When we know the root cause of a problem,  \\n we can propose the right solutions for addressing it.  \\n Otherwise, if you don't do this work,  \\n you run the risk of proposing solutions based on assumptions  \\n and making the wrong decisions.  \\n Let's look at some root cause analysis techniques.  \\n Any of these are good options to use in a workshop  \\n or even when conducting interviews with stakeholders.  \\n Five whys is a fun technique using a process  \\n of repetitively asking a series of why questions  \\n to get to the root cause of the situation.  \\n You ask your stakeholders to state the problem.  \\n They tell you that the amount of time it's taking  \\n to fulfill customer orders has spiked.  \\n You ask, \\\"Why is this happening?\\\"  \\n They tell you they don't have enough people.  \\n You capture their answers and ask a second why question,  \\n probing for more details.  \\n You ask, \\\"Why don't you have enough people?\\\"  \\n And you continue the process  \\n until you've drilled into the situation.  \\n Typically, this means asking about five questions.  \\n Now, five isn't a hard or fast rule,  \\n but it's the typical amount of questioning required  \\n to be able to identify the underlying problem.  \\n To see a full five why conversation  \\n between a business leader and business analyst,  \\n check out the document titled 5Whys in the Exercise Files.  \\n Here's another technique to try,  \\n the fishbone diagram,  \\n also known as a cause-and-effect diagram.  \\n It's a visual model for facilitating root cause discussions  \\n that look like this.  \\n It can help you decompose causes and effects  \\n as you work through understanding a root cause.  \\n Start by writing the business effect  \\n at the head of the fish,  \\n and then you facilitate discussions  \\n to draw out underlying causes,  \\n which you'll represent on the various fish bones.  \\n Using our first example,  \\n I'll write Fulfillment Time Increasing.  \\n Then I'll facilitate discussions  \\n to draw out a list of potential causes,  \\n placing each on the main bones of the fish.  \\n From the main bones, I'll place secondary causes  \\n and tertiary causes if we need to.  \\n The information used to build out the fish is taken  \\n from stakeholder discussions.  \\n You use the consecutive questioning of five whys  \\n to fill in all the bones on the diagram.  \\n Now, there's also an interrelationship diagram,  \\n another useful technique  \\n to analyze cause-and-effect relationships.  \\n Start with a blank canvas.  \\n Place the main problem on the board  \\n to focus your participants.  \\n Ask participants to brainstorm a list  \\n of causes for the problem.  \\n For each cause,  \\n add an oval on the board and label it appropriately.  \\n Then focus your participants on a single cause at a time,  \\n asking them to understand the effect  \\n each is having on the business.  \\n Place each effect on the board,  \\n and establish a relationship  \\n between each cause and its associated effects.  \\n Use an arrow to establish these relationships,  \\n and have the arrowhead pointing to the effect.  \\n When participants have exhausted  \\n providing causes and effects,  \\n count up the number of inputs and outputs.  \\n Once completed, review the model together  \\n to pinpoint the primary causes for the problem.  \\n The oval having the largest number  \\n of outbound arrows will be the main cause  \\n of the problem under discussion.  \\n In our example,  \\n high shipping cost is the main cause of the problem.  \\n If you find yourself solving business problems  \\n without understanding what's causing the situation,  \\n don't assume.  \\n Try one or more root cause techniques.  \\n Doing so will help you avoid making decisions  \\n off assumptions and avoid costly mistakes.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3051932\",\"duration\":248,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Technique: Business model canvas\",\"fileName\":\"3009141_en_US_02_03_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Find out how to build a business model canvas to perform strategy analysis. \",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":13871972,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

In strategy analysis, solution options are analyzed  \\n in many different ways, including financially.  \\n Financial analysis provides decision makers guidance  \\n on whether a solution is a good investment.  \\n Once solution options are identified,  \\n it's good practice to analyze options  \\n to estimate the possible financial return of each.  \\n But analyzing financially  \\n is one of the most feared ways to analyze  \\n because many business analysts don't feel qualified  \\n or comfortable with their financial skills.  \\n But there's nothing to fear  \\n because you're not expected to be an expert in finance.  \\n But you can and should leverage those that are.  \\n Consider seeking out the assistance of a financial analyst  \\n or similar role from your finance department  \\n who could perform the financial calculations  \\n for the solution options listed in your business case.  \\n Your input is analyzing the results of their work.  \\n You'll need someone who knows how senior leaders  \\n make investment decisions  \\n and are familiar with the financial valuation techniques  \\n most favored by your organization.  \\n Here are four commonly used valuation techniques.  \\n The first is payback period.  \\n This is how long it takes for the business  \\n to produce enough benefit from the solution  \\n to surpass the costs incurred to build and deliver it.  \\n Because the payback period is a time period,  \\n it's represented in months or years.  \\n The longer it will take the business  \\n to recover the original investment,  \\n the higher the risk.  \\n For example, when comparing two options  \\n based on the payback period,  \\n if the business covers this cost  \\n after year two with option A,  \\n but it takes four years with option B,  \\n option B is riskier,  \\n hence option A is more desirable.  \\n Then there's the return on investment or ROI.  \\n It's the amount of return obtained for what was invested.  \\n It's calculated as a percentage  \\n by dividing the average return or benefits  \\n by the projected cost to obtain them.  \\n It's not uncommon for a business  \\n to establish a minimum ROI percentage  \\n in order to approve a business case.  \\n As an example, if you're informed by finance  \\n that option A has an ROI of 30%,  \\n and option B has a return of 10%,  \\n option A is the better investment financially.  \\n Now, have you heard about IRR?  \\n An internal rate of return or IRR is the interest rate  \\n at which an investment breaks even.  \\n Another way to think of the IRR  \\n is that it's used to calculate the amount of growth  \\n or return an investment is expected to provide.  \\n Companies will establish a minimum IRR  \\n that investments must surpass.  \\n These are referred to as hurdle rates.  \\n So if the hurdle rate is 10%,  \\n and if the IRR for solution A is 12%,  \\n and it's 15% for solution B,  \\n both options are viable  \\n because they surpass the hurdle rate.  \\n But solution B would be the preferred solution  \\n since its financial return is more.  \\n And finally, the last valuation technique  \\n I'll leave you with is net present value.  \\n This is used to calculate the difference  \\n between the present value of both cash inflows  \\n and cash outflows over a specified time period.  \\n It takes into consideration the time value of money,  \\n looking at the impacts of inflation  \\n and how money can be invested  \\n and grow over the time period.  \\n You'll want to look for the option with the highest NPV.  \\n I hope you won't shy away  \\n from including the financial analysis in the future,  \\n now that you know it's perfectly acceptable  \\n to leverage the financial experts  \\n in performing these calculations.  \\n Financial analysis is a tried and true way  \\n many leaders make decisions  \\n about which solutions to invest in.  \\n So you won't want to overlook including one or more  \\n of the valuation techniques,  \\n now that you know your finance experts are there to help.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

You know the panic that sets in  \\n when you're getting ready to implement a solution,  \\n and all of a sudden a huge problem surfaces  \\n that's stopping the team from delivering.  \\n The findings have to be reported,  \\n and management is not going to be happy with the news.  \\n Team members are starting the blame game.  \\n It's uncomfortable and stressful.  \\n You ask yourself, \\\"How could the situation  \\n have been avoided?\\\"  \\n In strategy analysis, we minimize failures  \\n by using risk analysis in management.  \\n The risk analysis technique directs the team  \\n to spend time early to identify concerns  \\n or uncertainties that could negatively impact each solution.  \\n For example, a risk area might be from the development  \\n and delivery of the solution,  \\n such as the ability of the team to deliver on time,  \\n within budget, within scope,  \\n as well as impede the expected value of the solution.  \\n As a result of analyzing risks early,  \\n teams are better prepared with plans of action up front,  \\n which is much better, much preferred  \\n than being hit with the unanticipated circumstances.  \\n Risk analysis involves four steps.  \\n First, risk identification involves identifying a list  \\n of potential risks that could impact the solution delivery,  \\n including anything that could impede the expected value  \\n of the solution.  \\n Consider facilitating a brainstorming session  \\n to generate a quick list of potential risks.  \\n Your key stakeholders may apply lessons learned  \\n or expert judgment when helping create the list.  \\n This second step of this technique is risk analysis,  \\n or analyzing each risk based on the impact and probability.  \\n Impacts can be stated in terms of impact to value,  \\n cost, schedule or quality.  \\n And probability can be stated as a percentage  \\n or by using an indicator such as low, medium, high.  \\n For example, a tight labor market  \\n could result in poor service to customers  \\n due to a high number of untrained workers.  \\n The business determines the impact to quality is high  \\n and the probability of occurrence is also high,  \\n based on conditions they are currently facing  \\n in the marketplace.  \\n Third, risk evaluation is determining  \\n whether each risk is acceptable.  \\n Through discussions with key stakeholders,  \\n here you'll draw out risk tolerance levels.  \\n For example, if risk averse,  \\n the business is unwilling to accept a risk.  \\n If risk neutral, they will accept some risk,  \\n depending on its consequences.  \\n And if risk seeking, they're willing to accept  \\n or even seek out more risk  \\n in order to achieve more gain or value.  \\n Each risk should be evaluated based on these  \\n or other tolerance levels you'll establish.  \\n In our prior examples, the company prides itself on quality.  \\n Therefore, they evaluate the risk of poor service  \\n and state they are unwilling to accept the risk  \\n of employing a high number of untrained workers  \\n due to its impact on the customer experience.  \\n Finally, fourth, risk treatment,  \\n this is establishing the course of action  \\n the business will take should the risk occur.  \\n To arrive at this answer,  \\n you'll use the results of risk analysis  \\n and risk evaluation.  \\n Using our prior example, because quality is a cornerstone  \\n of how this business operates,  \\n the business chooses to avoid the risk completely.  \\n So they plan to roll out an incentive program  \\n to ensure attrition rates stay below 8%.  \\n They will also require all new hires complete two weeks  \\n of mandatory training before starting their positions.  \\n Identifying and managing risks early and often  \\n helps teams be better prepared  \\n when negative situations happen.  \\n Consider using this technique to keep a pulse  \\n on any potential risk that can impact the solution,  \\n and get your team prepared to know how to react  \\n should the risk occur.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"4.
