/view curation                            # Show current curriculum
```

## Architecture

Mentor uses a three-agent workflow:

1. **L&D Specialist**: Designs ideal curriculum structure from topic description
2. **Curriculum Specialist**: Converts designs into structured learning modules  
3. **Course Librarian**: Maps modules to actual courses using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Each agent has specialized prompts and expertise areas, ensuring high-quality, pedagogically sound curricula.

## Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `Mentor()` | Main curriculum generation function |
| `MentorChat` | Interactive curriculum building interface |
| `review_curriculum()` | Expert evaluation of learning paths |
| `recommend_sequence()` | AI-optimized course ordering |
| `Curriculum` | Structured curriculum data model |

## Configuration
