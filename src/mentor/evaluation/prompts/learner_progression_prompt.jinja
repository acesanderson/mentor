{{curriculum}}
</curriculum>

Go through the curriculum and take notes on each course.

Reflect on what you would learn from each course and how it builds upon previous knowledge.

Using a Chain of Thought approach, you MUST identify at least 2-3 specific concerns such as:
- Knowledge prerequisites that might be missing
- Potential skill gaps between adjacent courses
- Mismatches in difficulty levels or expertise requirements
- Content that seems out of sequence or improperly ordered
- Audience misalignment between courses in the sequence
