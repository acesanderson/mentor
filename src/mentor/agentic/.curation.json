 \\n Research shows that those who work  \\n with transformational leaders  \\n are more motivated in their jobs.  \\n The teams they lead have better results and less burnout.  \\n That is because transformational leaders use four practices  \\n that help the people on their team perform at their best.  \\n Let's explore each of the four practices.  \\n The first practice is to lead  \\n with a purposeful vision for change.  \\n You work with your team to co-create a motivating vision  \\n of what great looks like.  \\n This is a change that you're together willing to drive.  \\n When you create a shared vision that inspires people,  \\n they bring more energy and enthusiasm to the work.  \\n The second practice is to role model integrity.  \\n You are clear about your values  \\n and have high standards of integrity.  \\n Your actions are consistent with those values,  \\n and this inspires others to trust and follow you.  \\n The third practice is to stay curious  \\n and inspire innovation.  \\n You invite your team to bring their very best ideas.  \\n You get curious about different points of view.  \\n You encourage open debate on solutions.  \\n This encourages others to feel like their ideas matter  \\n and they contribute more.  \\n The fourth practice is to empower each to be their best.  \\n You create a personal connection with team members  \\n that lets them know that you care  \\n about their goals and aspirations.  \\n You're willing to get to know their unique talents  \\n and adapt to their ways of working because you believe  \\n they have a powerful contribution to make.  \\n As I write about in my book \\\"Wired for Authenticity,\\\"  \\n the best leaders lead adaptively  \\n from the core of who they are.  \\n They inspire others to contribute their best.  \\n Let me share the story of Anna.  \\n In this course, we will follow Anna  \\n as she practices transformational leadership.  \\n She's a team member whose team,  \\n the Apollo Project, is under pressure with tight deadlines.  \\n She sees that people around her are trying their best,  \\n but they're stressed out.  \\n There's no trust on the team,  \\n and their boss seems to be disengaged.  \\n Our friend, Anna, has a choice.  \\n She can disengage or she can decide to make a difference.  \\n Of course, Anna, our hero, decides to make a difference.  \\n She loves a good challenge.  \\n She's inspired to grow herself as a leader  \\n because she knows that to make a difference,  \\n she has to start with herself first.  \\n To grow as a leader, there are five important steps.  \\n First, discover the impact you want to have.  \\n This will keep you motivated because change can be hard.  \\n Second, understand your current mindsets.  \\n Some of these prevent you from making that impact.  \\n Third, discover and start to practice new mindsets  \\n that will help you create impact.  \\n Fourth, create new practices  \\n or behaviors that will help you make the shift.  \\n And fifth, reinforce the new practices  \\n until they become habits  \\n and are almost effortless.  \\n They start to become part of who you are.  \\n We will follow these steps in this course.  \\n To help you in this process,  \\n we have a self-assessment questionnaire  \\n called Transformational Leader Mindsets  \\n in the Exercise File.  \\n Take just five minutes to go through that self-assessment  \\n so you can better understand where you are today  \\n and what mindsets you can shift.  \\n After all, we need your impact in our workplaces.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4550004\",\"duration\":170,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"At the heart of transformation is you\",\"fileName\":\"777382_en_US_00_03_2023Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"updateType\":\"UPDATED\",\"editingNotes\":\"777382_00_03_LA304K_Heart_01_A.mov\",\"handoutNotes\":\"Discover Your Inspiration.pdf\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":230,\"exerciseFileDisplayText\":\"Exercise Files > Discover Your Inspiration.pdf\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"Examine your situation and uncover your motivation to create transformation.

 \\n If not, keep working on it  \\n and perhaps find a trusted friend to help you.  \\n The root of the word \\\"inspire\\\"  \\n comes from the Latin word \\\"to breathe\\\".  \\n I hope that connecting with your purpose  \\n breathes aliveness into you,  \\n so you can be fully energized  \\n and find meaning in the work that you do.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4554002\",\"duration\":230,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Create your shared vision for change\",\"fileName\":\"777382_en_US_01_03_2023Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"updateType\":\"UPDATED\",\"editingNotes\":\"777382_01_03_LA304K_Create_02_A.mov\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":273,\"exerciseFileDisplayText\":\"Exercise Files > Create Your Shared Vision.pdf\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"A vision is the outcome, the dream of a better future, that you want to create with others.

Okay, I have a confession to make.  \\n When I was a young manager, I used to have a secret wish.  \\n That wish was that I had a magic wand  \\n that'd make people do exactly what I wanted them to do.  \\n Sadly, that's true.  \\n I had a tight deadline on a project I was working on  \\n with a multifunctional team.  \\n I was impatient to move the project ahead,  \\n and I was having a hard time convincing my teammates  \\n to get what I needed done on time.  \\n I went in to complain to my boss  \\n about my lazy team, and he laughed.  \\n He said, if you want to influence people,  \\n you have to first connect with them.  \\n Here's what I said.  \\n I don't want to connect with people.  \\n It takes too long.  \\n I just want them to do their jobs.  \\n I'm sure he detected a slight tone of annoyance in my voice.  \\n \\\"Are you getting what you need now,\\\" he asked.  \\n \\\"No,\\\" I said.  \\n \\\"Then try something different,\\\" he said.  \\n Fast forward to now.  \\n More and more, we lead with people  \\n over whom we have no authority.  \\n Even if they report to us,  \\n when we influence them with their motivations in mind,  \\n rather than authority, we get better results.  \\n Research suggests that people  \\n have three basic psychological needs in the workplace.  \\n We need to feel competent in what it is that we're doing.  \\n We need to feel a meaningful connection to others.  \\n We need to feel a sense of autonomy  \\n where we're in control of our own lives.  \\n When we connect with people with a sincere desire  \\n to understand what's important to them, what energizes them,  \\n how they like to work, it's easier to influence them.  \\n Let's start with some mindsets that will be helpful for you  \\n as a transformational leader in influencing people.  \\n First, each person, no matter how different from me,  \\n has value to add, and they deserve my respect.  \\n In my younger days,  \\n I just wanted to work with people who were like me.  \\n Second, when I become genuinely interested in people,  \\n they become more open to collaborating.  \\n This mindset is supported by neuroscience.  \\n Each of us has mirror neurons in our brains.  \\n This is our empathy mechanism  \\n where we unconsciously mimic each other's behavior.  \\n A great example of this is when somebody yawns  \\n and others in the room,  \\n all of a sudden have some impulse to yawn.  \\n So it is with influence.  \\n When you're open to being influenced,  \\n you can better influence others.  \\n Third, bringing different points of view into discussion  \\n helps me be smarter  \\n and also helps us make better decisions.  \\n This mindset is supported by data.  \\n The teams who make the best decisions  \\n are those who bring together diverse points of view.  \\n Fourth, I need to treat a person  \\n based on what motivates them  \\n rather than treat everyone the same.  \\n I can adapt my own style to what will work best  \\n to communicate with others.  \\n My old boss also used to have another saying.  \\n When you're in France,  \\n you're more likely to get what you want  \\n when you try to speak French.  \\n Rather than trying to speak English, just louder.  \\n Look at the table in the graphic  \\n and see what mindsets you hold  \\n and which you want to practice more of  \\n as a transformational leader.  \\n If you're still not convinced  \\n about the power of genuine connection,  \\n consider research by Dr. Barbara Fredrickson.  \\n Her research shows that micro moments  \\n of positive connection with others  \\n are actually good for our own wellbeing.  \\n In her book, \\\"Love 2.0,\\\"  \\n Dr. Fredrickson shows how genuine connection with others  \\n nourishes our own health, wisdom, and longevity.  \\n As transformational leaders,  \\n when we bring positive intent, curiosity,  \\n and respect to others' points of view,  \\n it unconsciously creates a motivation in others  \\n to be more open to our points of view,  \\n and we create a space of open dialogue  \\n that gets better buying and better decisions.  \\n Here's your action step.  \\n Think about the people who will be impacted  \\n by the change you're driving.  \\n Create a plan to get to know them  \\n and where they stand in terms of their resistance  \\n or commitment to the change.  \\n Then have a trust building conversation  \\n to share your point of view and understand theirs.  \\n

 \\n There are many resources available to you to do that.  \\n First, listen at a deeper level.  \\n Normally, we're listening to others' words,  \\n but mostly, we're waiting to respond to them.  \\n Our attention is divided between  \\n what the other person is saying  \\n and our own thoughts and feelings.  \\n When we listen deeply, we're paying more attention  \\n to the other person.  \\n We're noticing not just the words,  \\n but also the emotions behind the words.  \\n We're noticing the body language,  \\n what is not being said, but being felt.  \\n We start to notice when a person is energized  \\n and what's energizing them.  \\n We can then bring our curiosity to this.  \\n For example, you can say,  \\n \\\"I'm noticing you're really energized right now.  \\n What's energizing for you?\\\"  \\n Or, \\\"You seem tired or depleted, what's got you down?\\\"  \\n This helps us know others' motivators.  \\n Try to discover others' strengths  \\n by using an assessment tool with your team.  \\n Tools like the StrengthsFinder help each team member  \\n discover the strengths that they are motivated to exercise.  \\n You can also discover strengths  \\n by asking others what someone does well.  \\n Once we have a sense of other strengths,  \\n we can help them find ways to bring those strengths  \\n to their work, or we can assign them projects  \\n where their strengths will have impact.  \\n We catch them doing something right  \\n and we give them positive feedback.  \\n This creates a cycle of motivation  \\n that helps them bring even more personal energy  \\n and focus to their work.  \\n We can also bring our curiosity  \\n and ability to ask good questions  \\n to help them discover their strengths,  \\n energizers, and their aspirations.  \\n In the exercise file called \\\"Discover Strengths  \\n and Energizers\\\", you will find a list of these questions.  \\n Now, start to think about the people you work with.  \\n Next to each person's name,  \\n write down what you know to be their strengths,  \\n their energizers, and their aspirations.  \\n If you're coming up short,  \\n I definitely recommend you set up some time  \\n to get curious and connect with the people  \\n so you can help them be at their very best.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2708005\",\"duration\":257,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Managing resistance to change\",\"fileName\":\"777382_en_US_04_03_2023Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"updateType\":\"UPDATED\",\"editingNotes\":\"777382_04_03_LA304K_Change_01_A.mov\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":274,\"exerciseFileDisplayText\":\"Exercise Files > Stakeholder Map.pdf\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"As a leader on a mission to drive change and make a difference, you will likely encounter resistance to your ideas.

This is when we openly resist change.  \\n We raise objections to the change  \\n based on what we think will go wrong.  \\n Flight.  \\n This is when we simply disengage  \\n from participating in the change.  \\n We may not show up to meetings  \\n or participate in discussions.  \\n Freeze.  \\n This is when we are in a state of confusion or inaction  \\n in response to the change.  \\n And appease.  \\n This is when we say what we feel we need to  \\n in order to please others,  \\n but it's coming from a place of fear  \\n rather than real buy-in to the change.  \\n As you yourself are faced with change  \\n or notice how others are responding to change,  \\n start to pay attention to these behaviors.  \\n Know that they're entirely normal  \\n because we as human beings are in fight or flight mode.  \\n So how do you manage resistance to change?  \\n First, create a stakeholder map.  \\n Who are the people your change will impact?  \\n What's at stake for them?  \\n How do you see them reacting?  \\n Are they in fight or flight mode?  \\n Second, get your stakeholders out of fight or flight mode  \\n so that a different,  \\n more rational part of the brain can kick in.  \\n How do you do that?  \\n You engage in a powerful conversation that builds trust.  \\n You start to understand what's important to people,  \\n what their fears are,  \\n where there are areas of common interest  \\n between you and them.  \\n Practice curiosity  \\n and ask your stakeholders these questions.  \\n What is the impact of this change on you?  \\n What's important to you in this situation?  \\n What do you see as the upsides and downsides?  \\n Use your listening skills and positive intent  \\n to learn from others  \\n and be open to their point of view.  \\n As a transformational leader,  \\n when you notice resistance,  \\n you partner with leaders to help them discover  \\n what it is that they are committed to.  \\n What is it that's creating resistance?  \\n If you're still facing resistance,  \\n here are some self-assessment questions you can ask yourself  \\n to see if you're approaching the resistance  \\n in the right way.  \\n Have I built trust?  \\n Have I discovered others' motivators and aspirations?  \\n Am I nurturing their confidence?  \\n Am I helping them become self-aware about their resistance?  \\n Am I bringing curiosity  \\n or am I critical in the conversation?  \\n You may even choose to get feedback from other teammates  \\n if you're not getting buy-in.  \\n Our jobs as leaders is not just to deliver the results,  \\n but in the process grow the people we lead with.  \\n In the exercise file Stakeholder Map,  \\n you will find in-depth explanations to these questions.  \\n I encourage you to use this to plan a powerful conversation  \\n when you notice someone who is resisting change.  \\n As you think about the change you want to drive,  \\n create your stakeholder map  \\n and decide who you will have  \\n this powerful conversation with.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4551008\",\"duration\":201,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Practices to grow leaders\",\"fileName\":\"777382_en_US_04_04_2023Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"updateType\":\"UPDATED\",\"editingNotes\":\"777382_04_04_LA304K_Grow_01_A.mov\\n\\n3 Exercise File overlays: \\nExercise Files > Managing Your Triggers.pdf\\n\\nExercise Files > Appreciating Others.pdf\\n\\nExercise Files > Authentic Work Relationships.pdf\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":254,\"exerciseFileDisplayText\":\"Exercise Files > Managing Your Triggers.pdf, Exercise Files > Appreciating Others.pdf, Exercise Files > Authentic Work Relationships.pdf\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"As a transformational leader, you want to inspire and bring out the best in others.

You've probably never heard\\nof Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton,\\nbut his story is one of the most inspiring\\nleadership lessons ever told.\\nIn 1914, he led an expedition to explore the Antarctic\\nwith the goal of crossing it from sea to sea,\\nspanning a total of 1,800 miles.\\nTo find a crew, he took an ad out in the newspaper,\\nwhich said, \\\"Men wanted for hazardous journey.\\nLow wages, bitter cold, long hours of complete darkness,\\nsafe return doubtful,\\nhonor and recognition in the event of success.\\\"\\nToday, that reads like a modern day job description,\\nexcept most employees and organizations\\ndon't even get the honor and recognition\\nin the event of success.\\n\\nAs their journey began,\\nit didn't take long for disaster to strike.\\nShortly into their journey,\\ntheir ship, the Endurance, became entombed in ice,\\nand for 10 months, the crew stayed there\\nuntil the ice finally crushed the ship.\\nBefore it submerged,\\neveryone was able to escape onto an ice floe,\\nwhich is a giant floating piece of ice.\\nThere the men lived for another five months\\nbefore the ice finally started to melt and break apart.\\nThe crew turned to Shackleton for guidance,\\nso he decided to set sail on their lifeboats\\nto Elephant Island,\\nwhich was a difficult five-day journey,\\nbattling high winds and seas.\\n\\nWhen they arrived there,\\nthey realized the island was uninhabited and uninhabitable,\\nso again, they turned to their fearless leader.\\nShackleton decided to take the least damaged lifeboat\\nalong with a small crew of 5 from the 12\\nand sailed to South Georgia Island,\\nwhich was over 800 miles away.\\nUpon arrival, the men had to then trek for several days\\nto a whaling station to get help.\\nIt took a total of three attempts\\nand three additional months to rescue the entire crew\\nwho hadn't stepped foot on solid land in 17 months.\\n\\nI love this story,\\nnot because everyone survived,\\nbut because of the explorer mindset\\nthat Shackleton exhibited that allowed them to survive.\\nHe refused to give up\\nand constantly kept a positive attitude.\\nHe encouraged his crew to sing songs about their loved ones\\nand to play hockey on the ice\\nto keep their minds engaged and distracted.\\nWith each challenge that was thrown his way,\\nhe had to keep an open mind in discover new solutions.\\nFor example, when trekking to the whaling station,\\nhe removed screws from the lifeboat\\nand attached them to the bottom of his shoe\\nto give him traction when walking.\\n\\nHe viewed roadblocks and challenges\\nas things that needed to be overcome,\\nnot as impenetrable obstacles,\\nwhich is exactly what having a growth mindset is all about.\\nShackleton was a curious person\\nwith a passion for exploration and discovery,\\nwho believed in being open to the opinion of others\\nand surrounding himself\\nwith people from different backgrounds.\\nExploration is a core part of human nature.\\nAs kids, we ask questions,\\nplay with things, and learn how something works.\\nEveryone has the explorer mindset in them,\\nwe just aren't encouraged to tap into it at work.\\n\\nOne of the most powerful things\\nthat you and your leaders can do\\nto practice this mindset\\nis to ask questions\\nabout how and why things get done at your company\\nand encourage others to do the same.\\nFor example, you might have a policy or procedure\\nthat everyone adheres to without even knowing why.\\nIt's one of those things that's been around for years\\nthat everyone hates,\\nyet everyone does.\\nWhy is it there?\\nAnd what can be done that is better?\\nGive yourself time on a regular basis\\nto read, discover, or listen to new things\\nthat are tangentially related to what you do.\\n\\nPerhaps it's listening to a podcast,\\ntaking a course like this one,\\nor reading a book.\\nLastly, make sure that when you put\\nyour leadership team together,\\nnot everyone thinks the same way.\\nIt's important to surround yourself with people\\nwho don't think like you.\\nIf you excel in critical thinking\\nand are great with numbers,\\nthen bring someone on the team\\nwho is more creative and open-minded.\\nYou want people who don't all think and act the same way.\\nIn a rapidly changing and uncertain world,\\nit's the

In 1912, a famous chef was born\\nin Pasadena, California\\nnot that far away from where I grew up.\\nShortly after, she went to college,\\nWorld War II broke out\\nand she wanted to serve,\\nbut at six-foot two,\\nshe was told that she was too tall.\\nInstead, she went to work\\nfor the Office of Strategic Services.\\nOn one of her assignments,\\nshe was asked to come up with a concoction\\nthat would keep sharks away from setting off underwater\\nexplosives that were designed for German U-boats.\\nShe played around with different ingredients\\nuntil she was finally able to develop something.\\n\\nThus, her foray into cooking was born.\\nThe world knows her as Julia Child,\\nand she is largely responsible for bringing French cooking\\nand cuisine to the United States.\\nWhat I love about Julia Child is\\nthat she was a master of balance.\\nShe had to make sure that the food she prepared not only\\nlooked and tasted good, but was healthy.\\nShe also had to balance French cooking with American culture\\nand expectations around food.\\nIf you've ever tried cooking, you know\\nthat if you put too much of one ingredient,\\nthe dish becomes too spicy.\\n\\nToo much of another ingredient,\\nand it becomes too sweet.\\nAs a leader, you and your leadership team only\\nhave two ingredients\\nyou need to balance, humanity and technology,\\nor what I call HumanIT, spelled Human-I-T.\\nThe human side of work is about things like purpose\\nand meaning, relationships, collaboration,\\npsychological safety, and employee experience.\\nThe IT side of work is about things like AI\\nand technology, the tools employees use\\nto get their jobs done, software,\\nhardware, and applications.\\n\\nIf you only focus on IT,\\nyour company might be able to scale\\nand focus on productivity and efficiency,\\nbut it will struggle in talent and innovation.\\nSimilarly, if you only focus on the human side of work,\\nyour company will attract and retain great people,\\nbut will struggle with speed, scale, and productivity.\\nThis is why you need both of these things.\\nHence, the need to think like a chef that is able\\nto balance both of these ingredients.\\nYou can practice the mindset of the chef in several ways.\\n\\nFirst, you have to genuinely care about the people\\nwho work with and for you.\\nI wish I could teach you how to care about your people,\\nbut the truth is that either you care for them or you don't.\\nAnd unfortunately, many leaders today just don't.\\nThey purely look at the bottom line\\nand see employees as costs on a spreadsheet.\\nSecond, you have to get in the kitchen with your employees.\\nIf you've ever been to one of those fancy restaurants,\\nyou'll notice that the chef is always in the kitchen tasting\\nthe food before it goes out,\\nmaking sure it's prepared in the right way.\\n\\nWhen putting your leadership team together,\\nyou need to make sure that you\\nand your leaders do the same thing.\\nThis means spending time on the ground floor\\nwith your employees,\\nasking them questions to get a sense of\\nwhat the right balance of technology and humanity like,\\nand where you might need to add more of one or the other.\\nIf you hear that employees are struggling\\nwith the same process over and over,\\nthat might be a place\\nwhere you can infuse more technology.\\nIf you hear that employees are struggling with connection\\nto the vision of the organization,\\nthat's a place\\nwhere you might need to add more humanity.\\n\\nLastly, the most important part of getting in the kitchen\\nwith your employees is making changes based on\\nwhat you see and hear.\\nSimply taking in feedback and observations is useless.\\nIf you don't do anything\\nwith the information that you collect.\\nSpend more time in the kitchen with your employees\\nand you and your leadership team\\nwill be able to work on getting\\nthat balance of humanity and technology just

Using the word emotional in the same sentence\\nas the word leader is a relatively new phenomenon.\\nAfter all, it wasn't that long ago when Fortune magazine\\nhad their annual list of the toughest bosses to work for,\\nand it was considered a badge of honor\\nto be in that magazine or to even work\\nfor one of those leaders featured in that magazine.\\nDuring and just post pandemic, things changed dramatically\\nwith many leaders valuing things like emotional intelligence\\nmore than what we consider traditional intelligence.\\n\\nWe are now seeing things balance out a bit more\\nwith an emphasis being placed\\non both competence and connection.\\nHowever, from the CEOs I interviewed,\\nthere were two specific aspects of emotional intelligence\\nthey identified as being most crucial.\\nThe first is empathy, and the second is self-awareness.\\nEmpathy is about putting yourself in someone else's shoes\\nto understand how they are feeling,\\nwhat perspective they are taking\\nand where they are coming from.\\n\\nIt's an important skill to have that aids in anything\\nfrom conflict resolution\\nto developing new products for customers.\\nStephen Smith, the CEO of clothing retailer, LL Bean told me\\nthe following.\\nHistorically, empathy has not been a word\\nthat's used in business very often,\\nbut to be able to put yourself in somebody else's shoes\\nand to look at any dilemma or any problem,\\nor anything that you're trying to solve\\nfrom multiple perspectives\\nis one of the most important things\\nfor leaders to be able to do.\\n\\nOf course, you also want to build a team\\nthat has multiple perspectives as well,\\nso that you can find common ground\\nand then get to the best possible solution.\\nSelf-awareness is how well you know yourself,\\nthings like your emotions, strengths, weaknesses,\\nand state of mind.\\nHowever, it's also about having alignment between\\nhow you perceive yourself and how other people perceive you.\\nFor example, if you think you're the best leader\\nin the world while at your company,\\nnobody wants to work for you,\\nthat's a lack of self-awareness.\\n\\nPaul Markovich is the CEO of Blue Shield California,\\nwhich has just over 7,000 employees\\nand serves more than 4 million members.\\nSelf-awareness has been critical in his leadership success.\\nHere's what he told me.\\n\\\"Every weekend I sit down\\nand think about what roles I want to play.\\nIf I want to be a good father, a good husband,\\na good servant of the community,\\nand an effective leader at work,\\nthen these are the things I'm going to do this week.\\nI plan my week with purpose,\\nand that's been effective for me.\\n\\nI have a mission statement\\nand it has guided my choices professionally,\\nwhere I want to work, how I want to work.\\\"\\nPaul also has a coach\\nwho interviews his direct reports every few months,\\nand then provides feedback to Paul,\\nwho then reviews that feedback with his senior team\\nand goes over how he's going to address it.\\nHans Berg, the CEO of Verizon said it best\\nwhen I interviewed him.\\n\\\"The first layer of skills a good leader must have\\nare internal, managing himself or herself\\nas an individual human being.\\n\\nThis includes physical health, emotional balance,\\nself-knowledge, everything that you bring along with you\\nto each meeting, each decision, each public event.\\\"\\nA lot of leaders are tempted to ignore\\nor de-emphasize this most basic layer,\\nbut they do so at their peril.\\nSo how can you and your leaders practice empathy\\nand self-awareness?\\nLet's start with empathy.\\nBrene Brown, the mega bestselling author and professor\\nat the University of Houston breaks down four steps\\nto practice empathy.\\n\\nPerspective taking or putting yourself\\nin someone else's shoes.\\nNumber two, staying out of judgment and listening.\\nNumber three, recognizing emotion in another person\\nthat you have maybe felt before.\\nAnd number four, communicating\\nthat you recognize that emotion.\\nFor self-awareness, there's a technique\\nthat Benjamin Franklin developed, which I love\\nand have used with many leaders.\\nIt's called a character balance sheet.\\nTake a piece of paper and fold it in half.\\nOn one side of the paper, write down all of your strengths\\nor assets, and then on the other side of the paper,\\nwrite down all of your weaknesses or liabilities.\\n\\nBen Franklin did this as a way to determine\\nthe overall worth of his character.\\nFor the external piece of self-awareness,\\nthe best thing you can do here is to have ongoing\\nand candid conversations with your leaders\\nand team members around the elements in your balance sheet.\\nSee if other people's perceptions of you align\\nwith your perceptions of yourself\\nand try to understand why or why not.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3951307\",\"duration\":282,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Leadership skill: Adaptive communication

listen to me speak live\\nor virtually for 20 minutes per year on average.\\nThus, these 20 minutes really need to count.\\nOtherwise, where's my impact as CEO?\\nJack Zenger and Joseph Folkman\\nfrom Zenger Folkman did some\\ngreat research on listening\\nwhere they looked at data from almost 3,500 people.\\n\\nThey looked at the top 5% who were considered\\nto be the most effective listeners,\\nand found that these people did four things.\\nThe best listeners don't just sit quietly.\\nThey participate in the conversation\\nby asking thoughtful questions\\nthat promote discovery

conversations\\nwhere information flows back\\nand forth between themselves and the other person.\\n\\nAnd lastly, great listeners make suggestions,\\nexplore other paths\\nbesides the one that the speaker might suggest.\\nNow, of course, it also goes without saying that a part\\nof being a good listener means paying attention\\nto your body language,\\nlooking someone in the eye,\\nand putting away distractions like your phone.\\nWhen you are with your leadership team, ask yourself\\nand encourage your leaders to ask themselves how many\\nof these four things are they doing,\\nand how can they make sure they are doing all four?\\nWhen David Nelms was the CEO of Discover Financial,\\nhe told me, a leader who doesn't adapt to the new ways\\nof communication will never be

your distinct privilege\\nto help other people become more successful than you,\\nat your organization.\\n\\nNot only do you need to embrace this,\\nbut so does your entire leadership team.\\nThe

chemists or chemical engineers.\\nEver since the company's founding in 1889,\\ndeveloping a new product has been more art than science.\\nFor any new product, the developer starts with\\na basic recipe, also known as a seed formula.\\n\\nHe or she then tweaks this formula by adding,\\ndeleting, or changing ingredients.\\nAs developers came more experience,\\nthey tend to gravitate towards a favorite set of ingredients.\\nThey develop go to solutions that they trust.\\nWhile this approach has worked for over 100 years,\\nthe company's leaders wondered if AI may help do a better job.\\n\\nCould they develop an intelligent platform to create\\nproduct formulas,\\none that learns and it gets better with experience?\\nIn 2019, McCormick signed a formal collaboration with IBM to explore\\nthe use of AI for new product development.\\nThe collaboration has proved highly successful,\\nand the company's now has several hundred new products in the market\\nconceived entirely by AI.\\n\\nMcCormick started by training the AI algorithms on historical data\\nabout recipes and their ingredients.\\nThe company's database included over 400,000 formulations prepared\\nfrom over 14,000 ingredients, many in different languages and\\nspread across countries.\\nAfter considerable effort as standardization and\\ncentralization,\\nthe database added up to 1 billion data

seasoning,\\nthen the flavor recipe should not include liquids.\\n\\nWhat defines a success?\\nWhich suggestion has the highest probability of success?\\nBased on learning from the vast database the AI models are able to\\ngenerate several formulations with a high probability of success.\\nThese formulations might use unique ingredients,\\ndifferent combinations of ingredients,\\nand or different ratios of ingredients.\\n\\nProduct developers and marketers have been surprised at entirely\\nnovel seasonings that, in hindsight, makes sense,\\nbut given that tunnel vision were beyond the

of the toughest challenges for any organization is pursuing two\\nconflicting goals at the same time: being consistent while also\\nbeing innovative.\\nConsistency in processes enables you to learn how to accomplish\\nthe same task better, faster, and perhaps cheaper.\\nConsistency in products and services also gives customers the\\nassurance that they will have the same experience,\\nwhether it's at the same or a different location.\\n\\nYet in our dynamic world, taken to the extreme,\\nconsistency can also be the shortest path to an organization's\\ndebt.\\nand order.\\nYou streamline the processes, lay out the standard operating\\nprocedures, ask people to stick to the stated\\npolicies and rules, and manage in a top down manner.\\nIt's also easy to nurture an organization for chaos that is a\\nnever ending departure from the routine.\\n\\nAll you have to do is tell people to do their own thing and\\njust sit and watch.\\nAs you might imagine, neither complete order nor\\ncomplete chaos is good for an organization's health.\\nInstead, you need an optimal mix of the two.\\nSo how do you effectively pursue both within the same company at\\nthe same time without creating confusion or an awful mess?\\nHere are some guidelines.\\n\\nFirst,\\nThink in terms of a stable platform coupled with\\ndynamic action.\\nThe look and feel of Amazon's website and how you navigate\\nthrough it,\\nit's like a platform.\\nAmazon cannot risk changing it too often,\\nbut the products and prices are thoroughly dynamic.\\nSimilarly, the layout of a Walmart store is like a platform.\\n\\nIt shouldn't change too often.\\nHowever, what they sell and at what prices can be a\\nlot more dynamic.\\nSecond, create well-crafted sandboxes for experimentation.\\nPhillips Exeter Academy, a renowned boarding school,\\nhas literally created a section called Sandbox Courses in\\nits course catalog.\\nThis is where the school engages in curricular innovation,\\nsuch as cross-disciplinary courses or courses which integrate\\nclassroom learning with core or extra curricular activities.\\n\\nSome of these experimental courses may eventually become part of\\nthe regular course catalog,\\nothers may not.\\nThird, set up simple rules regarding how people allocate\\ntheir time between routine tasks and experimentation.\\n3M's unique 15% culture encourages employees to set aside\\na portion of their work time to proactively cultivate and pursue\\ninnovative ideas that excite them.\\n\\nFourth, consider conducting experiments in units that are\\ngeographically separate from other units.\\nThis way, you minimize confusion among staff and customers.\\nAlso, when some experiments fail, as they surely will,\\nyou minimize damage to your core business.\\nTake Uber or Lyft rather than experimenting in every city\\nacross the US network.\\n\\nThey might choose a few cities like Atlanta,\\nMiami, and Denver to try out new ideas.\\nFifth, if the interlinkages between various units are weak,\\nconsider separating them organizationally.\\nLook at Alphabet Inc, Google's parent.\\nAlphabet is a collection of companies such as Google\\nwith its own subunits,\\nsearch, advertising, maps, YouTube,\\nand Android.\\n\\nWaymo,\\nCalico,\\naging and age related diseases and others.\\nThis organizational separation allows each unit to pursue

The rise of Agentic AI brings with it\\nnot only opportunities,\\nbut also significant ethical challenges.\\nAs businesses increasingly rely on AI for decision-making\\nand operations, exploring ethical concerns is crucial\\nto ensure responsible deployment.\\nLet's go over some specific terms you may hear\\nwhen talking about AI ethics.\\nUndue semantics, blast radius,\\nand principles of least privilege.\\nFirst, we have the undue semantics,\\nwhich refers to situations where AI systems,\\ndespite being highly sophisticated,\\nfail to fully grasp the meaning or context\\nbehind the data they process.\\n\\nAI operates based on patterns and data correlations\\nwithout truly understanding the context\\nof the information they process.\\nThis can lead to decisions that seem rational\\non the surface, but lack the depth of human judgment.\\nFor example, an AI agent tasked with content moderation\\non Instagram might automatically delete a comment like,\\n\\\"kill it,\\\" on your vacation post,\\nmistakenly interpreting it as a threat.\\nNext is blast radius.\\nThis term refers to the potential scope\\nand impact of an AI system's failure.\\n\\nOne of the biggest ethical concerns with AI\\nis how significant one error can be.\\nFor instance, in the context of AI used\\nfor cancer detection, a single misdiagnosis\\ncan have life-altering consequences for the patient,\\nas well as serious implications for hospitals and doctors.\\nBlast radius is particularly crucial in industries\\nwhere humans' lives are at stake, such as healthcare,\\nor where intricate systems are closely linked, like finance.\\nWe refer to this as precision.\\n\\nOur final concept to explore\\nis the principle of least privilege.\\nThis concept, originating from cybersecurity\\nand system design, is also relevant to Agentic AI.\\nThe principle asserts that systems should only\\nhave the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.\\nThe rationale is to minimize risks from unauthorized access,\\ndata breaches, and unintended actions,\\nessentially to control the blast radius.\\nHowever, Agentic AI often requires broad access to data\\nand resources to function independently.\\n\\nBy carefully defining what the AI should be able\\nto accomplish, we can reduce the amount of data\\nthat it needs access to.\\nThe principle of lease privilege encourages\\nthoughtful consideration of what information\\nAgentic AI must access, and helps define\\nits decision-making capabilities much more precisely.\\nTo recap, the ethical concerns of Agentic AI,\\nsuch as undue semantics, blast radius,\\nand the principle of least privilege\\nare not just abstract concepts.\\nThey are real issues that can impact businesses,\\nindustries, and people's lives in profound ways.\\n\\nIt's essential for organizations to stay proactive\\nin understanding and addressing these concerns,\\nin addition to other ethical challenges\\nwe'll certainly see in the
