[34m# Review of Neural Networks and Deep Learning Curriculum[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m1[0m[34m. Overall Assessment[0m

[34mThis curriculum offers a solid foundation in neural networks and deep learning for learners with some Python and basic machine [0m
[34mlearning experience. It progresses logically from neural network fundamentals to advanced topics like GANs and specialized [0m
[34mapplications in sentiment analysis. The hands-on coding emphasis across courses is particularly valuable for the target audience. [0m
[34mWhile the curriculum has some minor redundancies and a few potential gaps, it generally provides a well-structured learning path that [0m
[34mbalances theoretical knowledge with practical implementation.[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m2[0m[34m. Detailed Analysis[0m

[34m### a. Topic Coverage[0m

[34mThe curriculum covers essential neural network and deep learning topics:[0m
[34m- Neural network fundamentals and architectures [0m[1;34m([0m[34mfirst course[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- Deep learning foundations with Python [0m[1;34m([0m[34msecond course[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- Model optimization techniques [0m[1;34m([0m[34mthird course[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- Advanced architectures like GANs [0m[1;34m([0m[34mfourth course[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- Real-world application in sentiment analysis [0m[1;34m([0m[34mfifth course[0m[1;34m)[0m

[34mThe progression from theory to practice and from basic to advanced concepts is logical and comprehensive. The inclusion of both [0m
[34mtheoretical concepts and hands-on implementation with tools like Keras and Google Colab aligns well with the audience's needs.[0m

[34m### b. Prerequisite and Difficulty Scaffolding[0m

[34mThe curriculum demonstrates thoughtful scaffolding:[0m
[34m- It begins with foundational neural network concepts in [0m[34m"Artificial Intelligence Foundations: Neural Networks,"[0m[34m establishing core [0m
[34mterminology and principles[0m
[34m- Builds on this with practical Python implementation in [0m[34m"Deep Learning with Python: Foundations"[0m
[34m- Advances to optimization techniques in the third course, which requires understanding from previous courses[0m
[34m- Introduces more complex architectures [0m[1;34m([0m[34mGANs[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m in the fourth course[0m
[34m- Culminates with a practical application [0m[1;34m([0m[34msentiment analysis[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m that integrates previous knowledge[0m

[34mThis progression appropriately considers the audience's existing Python and basic ML knowledge, starting from accessible concepts and [0m
[34mgradually introducing more complex topics.[0m

[34m### c. Course Relevance and Fit[0m

[34mAll courses appear relevant to the target topic and audience:[0m
[34m- The Keras focus in the first course is appropriate for Python users with some ML experience[0m
[34m- The GitHub Codespaces integration in the second and third courses provides practical coding experience without complex setup[0m
[34m- The fourth course on GANs exposes learners to advanced generative models with hands-on implementation[0m
[34m- The final course on sentiment analysis demonstrates how to apply neural networks to a common real-world problem[0m

[34mEach course emphasizes practical implementation, which matches the audience's need for applied learning rather than purely theoretical[0m
[34mcontent.[0m

[34m### d. Content Redundancy[0m

[34mThere is some overlap between courses, particularly:[0m
[34m- The first and second courses likely cover similar neural network fundamentals[0m
[34m- There may be redundancy in basic Keras introduction between the first course and later courses[0m
[34m- The Google Colab setup appears in multiple courses [0m[1;34m([0m[34mparticularly the fourth and fifth[0m[1;34m)[0m

[34mHowever, these redundancies are not excessive and may serve as helpful reinforcement of key concepts. Some repetition of foundational [0m
[34melements across courses is acceptable and can help cement understanding.[0m

[34m### e. Identified Gaps or Missing Topics[0m

[34mThis curriculum offers a solid foundation for individuals with Python experience and minimal machine learning knowledge to learn about[0m
[34mneural networks and deep learning. The progression from neural network fundamentals to advanced optimization techniques and practical [0m
[34mapplications is logical. The curriculum effectively balances theoretical concepts with hands-on implementation, particularly through [0m
[34mGitHub Codespaces integration in two courses. However, there are some gaps in prerequisite machine learning concepts and a need for [0m
[34mmore intermediate transitional content between foundational and optimization courses.[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m2[0m[34m. Detailed Analysis[0m

[34m### a. Topic Coverage[0m

[34mThe curriculum covers essential aspects of neural networks and deep learning:[0m

[34m- Fundamentals of neural networks [0m[1;34m([0m[34marchitectures, components, use cases[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- Implementation using Keras Sequential API[0m
[34m- Deep learning foundations using Python[0m

[34m- Practical application through sentiment analysis using RNNs[0m

[34mThe coverage progresses from theoretical foundations to practical implementation, which is appropriate. The inclusion of sentiment [0m
[34manalysis as a specific application provides valuable real-world context.[0m

[34m### b. Prerequisite and Difficulty Scaffolding[0m

[34m**Strengths:**[0m
[34m- The curriculum begins with neural network foundations before progressing to implementation[0m
[34m- There's a clear progression from basic concepts to optimization techniques[0m
[34m- The final course applies the knowledge to a specific use case[0m

[34m**Weaknesses:**[0m

[34mconcepts that would help contextualize neural networks[0m
[34m- The jump from [0m[34m"Deep Learning with Python: Foundations"[0m[34m to [0m[34m"Optimizing Deep Learning Models"[0m[34m might be steep without intermediate [0m
[34mcontent on building more complex models[0m

[34m### c. Course Relevance and Fit[0m

[34mAll courses are highly relevant to the topic of deep learning with Python:[0m

[34m- [0m[34m"Artificial Intelligence Foundations: Neural Networks"[0m[34m provides the conceptual grounding[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Deep Learning with Python: Foundations"[0m[34m bridges theory to implementation[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Optimizing Deep Learning Models"[0m[34m addresses essential performance improvement techniques[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Sentiment Analysis"[0m[34m course offers practical application in a specific domain[0m

[34mThe GitHub Codespaces integration in the second and third courses is particularly valuable for the target audience, allowing hands-on [0m
[34mpractice without complex environment setup.[0m

[34m### d. Content Redundancy[0m

[34mThere appears to be some potential overlap between the first two courses:[0m
[34m- Both cover neural network fundamentals[0m
[34m- Both mention implementing neural networks with Keras[0m

[34mHowever, the first course seems more conceptual while the second is more implementation-focused, so the redundancy may be purposeful [0m
[34mreinforcement rather than unnecessary repetition.[0m

[34m### e. Identified Gaps or Missing Topics[0m

[34mSeveral important areas appear to be missing from the curriculum:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Basic machine learning concepts** as prerequisites [0m[1;34m([0m[34mgiven the audience's limited ML experience[0m[1;34m)[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m3[0m[34m. Recommendations[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Add an introductory course** on machine learning fundamentals to provide context for neural networks, covering:[0m
[34m   - Supervised vs. unsupervised learning[0m
[34m   - Training/validation/test splits[0m
[34m   - Evaluation metrics[0m
[34m   - Basic ML algorithms for comparison[0m

[34m   - Provide gradual progression to more complex architectures[0m
[34m   - Balance the text-focused sentiment analysis with image processing[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Include content on transfer learning** either as a separate course or within the optimization course to teach students how to [0m
[34mleverage pre-trained models.[0m

[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Add a final course on model deployment** to help students take their models to production environments.[0m

[1;34m5[0m[34m. **Incorporate ethical considerations** throughout the curriculum or as a dedicated module discussing bias, fairness, and [0m
[34mresponsible AI development.[0m

[1;34m6[0m[34m. **Clarify the distinction** between the first two courses to minimize redundancy, possibly by:[0m
[34m   - Making the first course more theoretical with minimal coding[0m
[34m   - Ensuring the second course quickly references concepts before diving into implementation[0m

[34mThis enhanced curriculum would provide a more comprehensive learning path that addresses the full lifecycle of deep learning projects [0m

[34m# Review of Deep Learning with Python Professional Certificate Curriculum[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m1[0m[34m. Overall Assessment[0m

[34mThe [0m[34m"Deep Learning with Python Professional Certificate by Anaconda"[0m[34m curriculum provides a reasonably structured introduction to deep [0m
[34mlearning for people with some Python experience and minimal machine learning background. The curriculum progresses logically from [0m
[34mneural network foundations to implementation, optimization, and a practical application. While the progression is sound, there are [0m
[34msome gaps in prerequisite knowledge and practical implementation specifics that could be addressed to better serve the target [0m
[34maudience.[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m2[0m[34m. Detailed Analysis[0m

[34m### a. Topic Coverage[0m

[34mThe curriculum covers several key areas of deep learning:[0m
[34m- Fundamentals of neural networks [0m[1;34m([0m[34marchitectures, components, use cases[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- Building and training neural networks with Keras[0m
[34m- Optimization techniques [0m[1;34m([0m[34mdata preprocessing, regularization, hyperparameter tuning[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- Practical application through sentiment analysis with RNNs[0m

[34mThe coverage is reasonably comprehensive for an introduction to deep learning, particularly with the inclusion of both theory [0m[1;34m([0m[34mfirst [0m
[34mcourse[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m and practical implementation [0m[1;34m([0m[34msubsequent courses[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m. The final course on sentiment analysis provides a concrete application that[0m
[34mhelps solidify learning.[0m

[34m### b. Prerequisite and Difficulty Scaffolding[0m

[34m**Strengths:**[0m
[34m- The curriculum begins with foundational neural network concepts before moving to implementation[0m
[34m- There is clear progression from basic implementation to optimization techniques[0m
[34m- The final course applies the knowledge to a specific use case[0m

[34m**Weaknesses:**[0m
[34m- Given the audience has [0m[34m"very small amount of background in machine learning,"[0m[34m there may be insufficient coverage of basic machine [0m
[34mlearning concepts that underpin deep learning[0m
[34m- The jump from the first course [0m[1;34m([0m[34mtheory-focused[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m to the second course [0m[1;34m([0m[34mimplementation[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m might be steep for those with minimal machine [0m
[34mlearning experience[0m
[34m- The curriculum assumes some knowledge of model evaluation and metrics without explicitly covering these topics[0m

[34m### c. Course Relevance and Fit[0m

[34mAll courses are relevant to the topic of deep learning with Python:[0m
[34m- The first course offers conceptual foundations necessary for understanding neural networks[0m
[34m- The second and third courses focus on practical implementation and optimization using Python[0m
[34m- The fourth course applies learning to a specific use case [0m[1;34m([0m[34msentiment analysis[0m[1;34m)[0m

[34mThe fit for the audience is generally appropriate, though the transition between conceptual understanding and implementation might [0m
[34mneed additional support given the limited machine learning background of the audience.[0m

[34m### d. Content Redundancy[0m

[34mThere appears to be minimal harmful redundancy in the curriculum. Some overlap exists between:[0m
[34m- Neural network basics in the first and second courses, which is likely intentional reinforcement[0m
[34m- Optimization topics that may appear in both the second and third courses[0m

[34mThis overlap is likely beneficial for the intended audience as it reinforces key concepts.[0m

[34m### e. Identified Gaps or Missing Topics[0m

[34mSeveral important gaps exist:[0m
[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Foundational machine learning concepts**: Given the audience's limited background, a preliminary course on basic machine learning[0m
[34mconcepts would be valuable[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Data preparation**: While mentioned in optimization, dedicated coverage of data preparation for deep learning is needed[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Model evaluation**: More explicit coverage of how to evaluate deep learning models[0m
[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Deployment considerations**: No content on deploying trained models in production[0m
[1;34m5[0m[34m. **Deep learning ethics**: No explicit coverage of ethical considerations in deep learning applications[0m
[1;34m6[0m[34m. **Computer vision applications**: The curriculum focuses on text [0m[1;34m([0m[34msentiment analysis[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m but lacks coverage of image-based [0m
[34mapplications[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m3[0m[34m. Recommendations[0m

[34m### Course Additions[0m
[1;34m1[0m[34m. Add a preliminary course: [0m[34m"Introduction to Machine Learning Concepts for Deep Learning"[0m[34m covering basic concepts like training/test [0m
[34msplits, overfitting, and evaluation metrics[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. Add a course on computer vision applications with CNNs to balance the text-focused sentiment analysis course[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. Add a brief module on model deployment and deep learning ethics[0m

[34m### Course Modifications[0m
[1;34m1[0m[34m. Expand the second course [0m[1;34m([0m[34m"Deep Learning with Python: Foundations"[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m to include more gradual scaffolding from basic machine learning[0m

[34m# Curriculum Critique: Machine Learning Statistical Foundations Professional Certificate by Wolfram Research[0m

[34m## Overall Assessment[0m

[34mThis curriculum provides a structured approach to machine learning foundations with a focus on the mathematical underpinnings required for ML. The progression from [0m
[34mintroductory concepts to specialized mathematical domains [0m[1;34m([0m[34mlinear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m and finally to Wolfram-specific implementations is [0m
[34mlogical. However, there are several areas for improvement.[0m

[34m## Strengths[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Comprehensive Mathematical Foundation**: The curriculum properly emphasizes the critical mathematical disciplines that underpin machine learning.[0m

[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Clear Progression**: The sequence moves appropriately from general concepts to specific mathematical foundations before concluding with practical application in [0m
[34mWolfram.[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Instructor Consistency**: Having the same instructor [0m[1;34m([0m[34mTerezija Semenski[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m for the mathematical foundations courses likely provides consistency in teaching style [0m
[34mand approach.[0m

[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Theory-to-Application Connection**: The final course demonstrates how to apply theoretical knowledge using Wolfram Language.[0m

[34m## Areas for Improvement[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Lack of Practical Implementation in Foundation Courses**: The mathematical foundation courses appear to be heavily theoretical with insufficient information about[0m
[34mhow to implement these concepts in actual ML algorithms.[0m

[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Missing Intermediate Application**: There's a gap between the mathematical foundations and the final Wolfram-specific course. An intermediate course demonstrating[0m
[34mhow to apply these mathematical concepts in common ML algorithms would be beneficial.[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Limited Programming Context**: Beyond the final Wolfram course, there's little mention of programming skills or how mathematical concepts translate to code [0m
[34mimplementation.[0m

[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Minimal Coverage of Advanced ML Topics**: The curriculum lacks coverage of advanced topics like neural networks architecture, deep learning theory, or current [0m
[34mstate-of-the-art techniques.[0m

[1;34m5[0m[34m. **Software Dependency**: The curriculum seems heavily tied to Wolfram Language, which may limit students who wish to work with more broadly adopted frameworks like [0m
[34mPyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn.[0m

[1;34m6[0m[34m. **Limited Project-Based Learning**: There's insufficient emphasis on practical projects or capstone work that would allow students to integrate all concepts [0m
[34mlearned.[0m

[34m## Recommendations[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Add Implementation Components**: Include practical programming exercises in each mathematical foundation course that show how concepts directly apply to ML [0m
[34malgorithms.[0m

[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Introduce Framework-Agnostic ML Course**: Add a course between the foundations and Wolfram-specific course that teaches implementation using industry-standard [0m
[34mtools.[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Include Project-Based Learning**: Add a capstone project component that requires students to solve a real-world problem using the concepts learned.[0m

[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Expand Advanced Topics**: Consider adding a course on deep learning, reinforcement learning, or other advanced ML paradigms.[0m

[1;34m5[0m[34m. **Add Ethical Considerations**: Include content on ethics, bias, and responsible AI development throughout the curriculum.[0m

[1;34m6[0m[34m. **Practical Assessment Methods**: Clarify how students will be evaluated on their ability to apply these concepts, not just understand them theoretically.[0m

[34mThis curriculum provides a solid theoretical foundation but would benefit from stronger connections to practical implementation and industry-standard tools beyond the [0m
[34mWolfram ecosystem.[0m

[33m of the most commonly used UX research methods,  [0m
[33m and for good reason.  [0m
[33m Usability testing is the gold standard  [0m
[33m for evaluative research, and it's a flexible enough method  [0m
[33m to gather a variety of data.  [0m
[33m It's pretty easy to get started,  [0m
[33m but it's also easy to get caught up in some common pitfalls.  [0m
[33m I'm Amanda Stockwell.  [0m
[33m Welcome to the Usability Test Deep Dive.  [0m
[33m This course is for those of us who are already familiar  [0m
[33m with the basics of usability testing,  [0m
[33m and want to level up skills  [0m
[33m to be even more effective researchers.  [0m
[33m Join me as I discuss strategic considerations  [0m
[33m and practical tips to help you get the most out  [0m
[33m of your usability testing efforts.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Recap of usability testing[0m

[33m - A usability test is simply a tool to evaluate the ease  [0m
[33m of use of a product, service, or interface.  [0m
[33m At the core, a usability test involves observing  [0m
[33m representative users as they perform tasks,  [0m
[33m and assessing their experience and interactions.  [0m
[33m Like most UX tools, there are many variations,  [0m
[33m and it's important to understand those nuances  [0m
[33m so you can plan for your particular situation.  [0m
[33m While the general goal of usability testing  [0m
[33m is to assess usability, you might be doing so  [0m
[33m in vastly different contexts that change  [0m
[33m how you ought to plan, run, and analyze the sessions.  [0m
[33m If you're not already familiar with usability testing,  [0m
[33m now would be a great time to check out UX Foundations:  [0m
[33m Usability Testing, which covers the basics.  [0m
[33m In this course, I want to guide you through a discussion  [0m
[33m of different types of usability tests and their usage,  [0m
[33m and share things I've learned over more  [0m
[33m than a decade conducting usability tests.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m. Which Type of Test?[0m

[33m### Usability test locations[0m

[33m - Before we start diving into the specifics  [0m
[33m of running usability tests,  [0m
[33m let's take a step back to examine  [0m
[33m the types of usability tests, so we can understand  [0m
[33m the nuances and set ourselves up for success.  [0m
[33m The first variant in the usability test is location.  [0m
[33m Usability tests are traditionally conducted in person,  [0m
[33m meaning that you are physically sitting  [0m
[33m next to the participant during the session.  [0m
[33m In-person sessions have traditionally been run  [0m
[33m in a usability lab, where you have a dedicated room  [0m
[33m for the moderator and participant  [0m
[33m that has audio and video recording,  [0m
[33m and another room for observers,  [0m
[33m where the information is streamed.  [0m
[33m Yes, I'm talking the dreaded one-way mirror set up.  [0m
[33m These Labs might be at a third-party research facility,  [0m
[33m or even just a dedicated room of an office.  [0m
[33m If you don't have a lab, or need to bring the research  [0m
[33m to the participants, you might still conduct the sessions  [0m
[33m physically next to the participants.  [0m
[33m That could be as simple as sitting next to someone  [0m
[33m at their desk, or meeting them at a third-party location  [0m
[33m like a library or coworking space.  [0m
[33m You can still record audio and maybe video.  [0m
[33m It's just not quite as formal of a dedicated space.  [0m
[33m In recent years, it's also become much more possible  [0m
[33m and popular conduct usability tests remotely,  [0m
[33m meaning that you're connected digitally,  [0m
[33m but not physically present with the participants.  [0m
[33m There are many good video conferencing tools  [0m
[33m that allow you to see participants' faces  [0m
[33m and share and record the screen of any member of the party.  [0m
[33m So how to decide where to conduct sessions?  [0m
[33m Well, the answer as with most things in UX,  [0m
[33m is that it depends.  [0m
[33m Being in the same space as your participants  [0m
[33m has several benefits and is often seen as the gold standard.  [0m
[33m One large benefit is that you can more easily  [0m
[33m build rapport with participants.  [0m
[33m You can shake their hand, look them in the eye,  [0m
[33m smile and greet them.  [0m
[33m You may make a bit of small talk and be able  [0m
[33m to feel them out before you get too far into the session.  [0m
[33m More on this later.  [0m
[33m You can also observe their body language  [0m
[33m and facial expressions, which don't always match  [0m
[33m what they'll say.  [0m
[33m We'll talk more about that too.  [0m
[33m The lab setting is great for this kind of close observation  [0m
[33m and allows you to easily record audio and video  [0m
[33m so you can widely share and later revisit the sessions.  [0m
[33m It's also easier to use lower fidelity artifacts  [0m
[33m like paper prototypes if you're physically with someone  [0m
[33m and can provide some extra context.  [0m
[33m However, a lab isn't the ideal setting when the context  [0m
[33m someone is working in will greatly impact  [0m
[33m how they use something.  [0m
[33m Say you're working on improvements to a traffic  [0m
[33m and navigation app.  [0m
[33m How someone acts looking at an app while sitting  [0m
[33m at a table, may be very different than when  [0m
[33m they're trying to navigate rush hour traffic in their car.  [0m
[33m The category of research where you observe people  [0m
[33m in their own space is called ethnography.  [0m
[33m While it can create logistical challenges,  [0m
[33m it can also help you paint a richer picture  [0m
[33m of your user and how they use your product in context.  [0m
[33m If you don't have the budget to conduct formal recruiting,  [0m
[33m or don't have access to a dedicated space,  [0m
[33m you might use the guerrilla tactics of intercepting people  [0m
[33m in a public setting.  [0m
[33m Recruiting and conducting sessions in public spaces  [0m
[33m is best for when your product doesn't require  [0m
[33m particular domain expertise, you're not testing  [0m
[33m particularly sensitive material,  [0m
[33m and your budget doesn't leave you another option.  [0m
[33m On the other hand, even if you do have the opportunity  [0m
[33m to meet participants in person,  [0m
[33m remote sessions can have some advantages.  [0m
[33m The first is that remote work allows you  [0m
[33m to access participants who are geographically spread out  [0m
[33m without extra time or costs.  [0m
[33m The world is ever shrinking, and many of our products  [0m
[33m and services serve a large base of people.  [0m
[33m It's essential to be sure that you're incorporating  [0m
[33m feedback from multiple cultures, locations and contexts  [0m
[33m so as not to bias your results.  [0m
[33m Conducting sessions remotely can also save  [0m
[33m both the research team and the participant's time.  [0m
[33m You cut out commuting and set up time,  [0m
[33m and it can allow the researcher to more flexibly schedule  [0m
[33m sessions over a period of time.  [0m
[33m You could even conduct a few sessions  [0m
[33m of a research series in person and a few remotely,  [0m
[33m in order to access the participants you need.  [0m
[33m Or alternate between in-person and remote efforts  [0m
[33m depending on timing and resources.  [0m
[33m Consider switching it up occasionally to try out  [0m
[33m different methods and compare the results.  [0m
[33m Before you plan your usability test,  [0m
[33m carefully consider the context of your project  [0m
[33m and what location would be most beneficial and realistic.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Moderated vs. unmoderated usability tests[0m

[33m - Along with the option to conduct sessions remotely,  [0m
[33m more and more tools have been popping up  [0m
[33m to conduct unmoderated sessions,  [0m
[33m where you write out individual tasks for the users,  [0m
[33m and the participants complete each task on their own time.  [0m
[33m A tool provides the instructions, shows the questions,  [0m
[33m and records the actions of the user.  [0m
[33m There is no direct interaction between the participants  [0m
[33m and the researcher, which means that you need to plan  [0m
[33m unmoderated sessions even more carefully.  [0m
[33m They're also most appropriate for certain scenarios only.  [0m
[33m Because you pre-write the introduction, the core tasks,  [0m
[33m and the followup questions, unmoderated tests  [0m
[33m are best for live or very functional work  [0m
[33m that requires very little explanation.  [0m
[33m When you show a low fidelity or early stage prototype  [0m
[33m in person, you can explain limitations and provide context  [0m
[33m along the way.  [0m
[33m It's possible to navigate around known issues  [0m
[33m or work around empty areas when you moderate.  [0m
[33m Unmoderated sessions are best suited  [0m
[33m for straightforward, clear tasks  [0m
[33m that don't leave much room for interpretation,  [0m
[33m like assessing how easily someone can find  [0m
[33m a certain sort of a product on an eCommerce page,  [0m
[33m or how long it takes to check out  [0m
[33m on one site versus another.  [0m
[33m Participants are frequently put into artificial situations  [0m
[33m in usability tests anyway, but without a moderator present,  [0m
[33m it's even easier to fake things or tune out.  [0m
[33m Tasks that require emotional engagement or creativity  [0m
[33m are unlikely to get an authentic response  [0m
[33m in an unmoderated test.  [0m
[33m You also need to carefully construct the tasks  [0m
[33m to be sure they will get you the results you want.  [0m
[33m Turning goals into clear tasks already takes practice  [0m
[33m to master, and all the normal best practices apply.  [0m
[33m But writing unmoderated tasks is even more difficult.  [0m
[33m You have to explicit about you want the participant to do  [0m
[33m and when they should stop.  [0m
[33m And provide clear, specific, and realistic instructions,  [0m
[33m all without being too obvious.  [0m
[33m Make sure the tasks are written  [0m
[33m as directions, not questions.  [0m
[33m And be precise in the instruction.  [0m
[33m Let's say we were testing the LinkedIn Learning site.  [0m
[33m A good task might be something like,  [0m
[33m find a UX related LinkedIn Learning course  [0m
[33m you haven't yet watched, and stop when you get  [0m
[33m to a brief description of the course.  [0m
[33m Remember, participants won't have a chance to clarify,  [0m
[33m and you won't have a chance to probe.  [0m
[33m So if they misinterpret, the task may be wasted.  [0m
[33m It's especially important to pilot test unmoderated studies  [0m
[33m so that you can get the most authentic useful feedback.  [0m
[33m You also don't get the chance to probe,  [0m
[33m so make sure you include followup questions  [0m
[33m that are just as thoughtfully crafted.  [0m
[33m With all those limitations in mind,  [0m
[33m unmoderated studies also have some great benefits.  [0m
[33m You can run sessions in parallel and therefore collect  [0m
[33m many responses in a short amount of time.  [0m
[33m You save time and have access to a much larger  [0m
[33m and more spread out participant base  [0m
[33m than you might otherwise.  [0m
[33m You can usually offer a lower incentive  [0m
[33m to save yourself some money as well.  [0m
[33m I've used unmoderated studies to get super quick feedback  [0m
[33m from across the globe literally overnight.  [0m
[33m Everything from response to a new design direction,  [0m
[33m to interpretation of messaging options, to gut-checking  [0m
[33m which of an interaction pattern best suited our goals.  [0m
[33m These broad, quick studies have been especially useful  [0m
[33m when working in agile settings,  [0m
[33m and we needed data super fast.  [0m
[33m I also like to use unmoderated studies  [0m
[33m when I'm benchmarking and comparing the results over time.  [0m
[33m That makes it easy to set up  [0m
[33m and assures the questions remain consistent.  [0m
[33m As always, carefully consider the core goal  [0m
[33m and context of your research goals  [0m
[33m to determine the right kind of test for you.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Using usability tests to explore[0m

[33m - As we've discussed,  [0m
[33m usability tests involve observing representative users  [0m
[33m as they perform tasks.  [0m
[33m We typically think of this as evaluative research,  [0m
[33m which is meant to assess how well a solution works.  [0m
[33m We've also been discussing the need to carefully determine  [0m
[33m and craft realistic scenarios and tasks  [0m
[33m for the users to complete.  [0m
[33m But what if you don't know  [0m
[33m what tasks your users are trying to do in real life?  [0m
[33m What if you don't know what a realistic scenario is?  [0m
[33m There are other research methods  [0m
[33m like diary studies or contextual inquiries,  [0m
[33m to help you uncover user needs and behavior,  [0m
[33m but you can also modify usability test efforts  [0m
[33m to be more generative and help you learn  [0m
[33m about user's contexts.  [0m
[33m To do so, you'll remove the very defined tasks  [0m
[33m from your plan.  [0m
[33m You'll still have research goals and target areas to cover,  [0m
[33m but the tasks will be more general  [0m
[33m and more focused on hearing from the user  [0m
[33m how they accomplished a goal,  [0m
[33m than assessing a particular path for interaction.  [0m
[33m For instance, in a traditional test of an e-commerce site,  [0m
[33m you might have one task that is dedicated  [0m
[33m to assessing the search function and one that is designed  [0m
[33m to get participants to browse with categories.  [0m
[33m In a more exploratory usability test,  [0m
[33m you might ask users  [0m
[33m to generally identify a product that fits their needs  [0m
[33m and then observe which path they take,  [0m
[33m probing along the way  [0m
[33m to understand why they did it that way, what's preferable,  [0m
[33m and understand their decision-making process.  [0m
[33m You still want to understand  [0m
[33m how well the process works for them,  [0m
[33m but you're also evaluating the product or service  [0m
[33m more holistically and getting feedback  [0m
[33m about what they really do,  [0m
[33m rather than breaking it down to assess one piece at a time.  [0m
[33m Because of the need to follow up,  [0m
[33m you'll need to moderate this kind of exploratory test  [0m
[33m and be ready to be flexible during the sessions.  [0m
[33m You may end up uncovering totally new insights  [0m
[33m or discovering areas  [0m
[33m that you hadn't realized needed attention.  [0m
[33m Let's say you're working on a presentation tool  [0m
[33m and ask people to tell you about the images they include.  [0m
[33m You might've thought  [0m
[33m you wanted to explore the editing process  [0m
[33m but find out that your users  [0m
[33m actually don't really like to add pictures.  [0m
[33m Your new goal becomes to better understand that decision  [0m
[33m and learn more about their context,  [0m
[33m rather than to assess the ease of use of the feature,  [0m
[33m they wouldn't use.  [0m
[33m This sort of exploratory formative usability testing,  [0m
[33m can be done at any time there is an existing solution  [0m
[33m and you want to learn more  [0m
[33m about real behavior or motivation users have.  [0m
[33m That doesn't necessarily mean  [0m
[33m you have to test something live,  [0m
[33m but is often done in early stages of a redesign,  [0m
[33m assessment of a live product or early in the process  [0m
[33m of building something brand new.  [0m
[33m Exploratory unstructured usability testing,  [0m
[33m isn't the be-all and end-all way  [0m
[33m to understand user's contexts  [0m
[33m but it can be an extra approach in your research toolbox.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m2[0m[33m. Running the Tests[0m

[33m### Participant recruiting considerations[0m

[33m - Many people who are new to usability testing  [0m
[33m struggle most with questions about the participants.  [0m
[33m Who should you target?  [0m
[33m How many participants do you need?  [0m
[33m And how do you find them?  [0m
[33m There's plenty of material that can guide you  [0m
[33m through the basics.  [0m
[33m Understanding nuances can help you ensure  [0m
[33m you get the right people in your study,  [0m
[33m and therefore, the highest quality results for your team.  [0m
[33m One of the most common questions is who to recruit  [0m
[33m and how exact do you need to be  [0m
[33m in recruiting representative users.  [0m
[33m Lots of new researchers assume  [0m
[33m that you can include any general participant  [0m
[33m to identify usability issues.  [0m
[33m If you're working on something like voting machines  [0m
[33m or a general e-commerce site,  [0m
[33m then yes, your audience truly could be just about anyone.  [0m
[33m Maybe you just need to know which  [0m
[33m of two Add to Cart interactions is easier.  [0m
[33m Any member of the public should be able to provide you  [0m
[33m some feedback there.  [0m
[33m But more than likely, you're building something  [0m
[33m for a specific group of people  [0m
[33m who have a particular set of knowledge and experiences  [0m
[33m that impacts how they interact.  [0m
[33m Let's say you're working on a portal for medical providers  [0m
[33m to communicate context about diagnoses to their patients.  [0m
[33m Nurses and doctors are likely  [0m
[33m to use a more clinical set of language  [0m
[33m and have a deeper understanding  [0m
[33m of how to categorize ailments than a typical patient.  [0m
[33m But the portal needs to work for both type of user.  [0m
[33m Sure, a random person could give you feedback  [0m
[33m on the input part of the tool.  [0m
[33m And you'd likely identify some core issues.  [0m
[33m But you're likely going to miss nuances in the feedback  [0m
[33m that a medical professional would be able to provide.  [0m
[33m The closer your test participants are  [0m
[33m to the real users, the more authentic their feedback  [0m
[33m and higher the quality of insights you'll gain.  [0m
[33m If you have multiple different sets of user types,  [0m
[33m like the patients and providers here,  [0m
[33m make sure that you recruit participants from each group  [0m
[33m to include in your study.  [0m
[33m That leads me to my next recruiting tip,  [0m
[33m which is around the number you really need to include.  [0m
[33m You've probably heard the rule  [0m
[33m that you ought to have five users in your usability study.  [0m
[33m I'm not here to fight with that.  [0m
[33m But I want to shed a little extra light and clarity  [0m
[33m so that you can make the best choice for your work.  [0m
[33m That rule came from work that Jakob Nielson  [0m
[33m and Tom Landauer did in the '90s.  [0m
[33m They created a mathematical model that suggests  [0m
[33m you can find [0m[1;33m85[0m[33m% of usability problems  [0m
[33m after five similar participants.  [0m
[33m They suggested that instead of conducting single,  [0m
[33m large usability tests, the most effective route  [0m
[33m would be to conduct smaller, iterative studies  [0m
[33m with three to five participants each  [0m
[33m to maximize cost and benefit.  [0m
[33m If there are distinct user types,  [0m
[33m they suggest three to four participants  [0m
[33m from each category per round.  [0m
[33m Over the years, that extra contact has been lost  [0m
[33m and people just hear that five is the magic answer.  [0m
[33m Five participants is a good starting point.  [0m
[33m But please keep in mind that you will not find  [0m
[33m every issue after talking to that few participants.  [0m
[33m Furthermore, the rule only applies  [0m
[33m when you're talking about the same type of user.  [0m
[33m And if you're looking to establish baselines  [0m
[33m or compare quantitative data,  [0m
[33m you're likely going to want to increase  [0m
[33m that number even more.  [0m
[33m A good gut check on the right number of participants  [0m
[33m is feedback repetition.  [0m
[33m Once you start to hear the same thing over and over,  [0m
[33m you probably ought to spend your time addressing feedback  [0m
[33m rather than collecting more.  [0m
[33m If you have a more diverse set of users than you thought,  [0m
[33m that could be eight or [0m[1;33m10[0m[33m or even more sessions.  [0m
[33m If you start to hear all the same things  [0m
[33m after just a few participants,  [0m
[33m you can feel confident that you need to address  [0m
[33m those items first.  [0m
[33m Recruiting the right participants  [0m
[33m and getting the right sample size is key  [0m
[33m to making sure your usability sessions  [0m
[33m are the most effective for you.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Usability test logistics and preparation[0m

[33m - While it may seem obvious, carefully thinking  [0m
[33m through the logistics and small details of your study  [0m
[33m can really impact the quality of the data you gather.  [0m
[33m The schedule of the sessions is one  [0m
[33m of the easiest things for you to control,  [0m
[33m and can help make sure you get the most  [0m
[33m out of your sessions.  [0m
[33m I don't recommend more than six sessions  [0m
[33m in a day if you can help it.  [0m
[33m Moderating requires deep attention and it can be exhausting.  [0m
[33m We'll talk more about moderation tips,  [0m
[33m but schedule-wise, the most effective tactic is  [0m
[33m to spread sessions out over at least a few days.  [0m
[33m I also recommend giving yourself ample time  [0m
[33m in between sessions.  [0m
[33m You'll need this time to break for the obvious things,  [0m
[33m like snacks, but you can also use this time  [0m
[33m to take care of distractions, like email,  [0m
[33m touch base with teammates and stakeholders,  [0m
[33m and adjust anything within the test.  [0m
[33m I especially like to schedule a quick debrief  [0m
[33m with observers after each session  [0m
[33m to capture first impressions  [0m
[33m and discuss anything we might want to adjust  [0m
[33m for the next round.  [0m
[33m This built-in time also gives you wiggle room,  [0m
[33m if someone ran late or you're having trouble  [0m
[33m getting a chatty participant to wrap up.  [0m
[33m You'll also want to think through how you communicate  [0m
[33m with observers and stakeholders during the sessions.  [0m
[33m I'd always recommend recording the sessions  [0m
[33m and sharing the video with team members,  [0m
[33m but it's also good to livestream  [0m
[33m and allow others to have the opportunity  [0m
[33m to ask you questions or suggest followups in realtime.  [0m
[33m You might want to set up a group chat or text.  [0m
[33m Just make sure you don't get too distracted  [0m
[33m during the session.  [0m
[33m I recommend that observers document all their questions  [0m
[33m and notes along the way, then send one communication  [0m
[33m to the moderator to circle back to  [0m
[33m at the end of the session.  [0m
[33m Sometimes the questions end up being answered,  [0m
[33m or a new thread is uncovered, but it ensures  [0m
[33m that the stakeholders are engaged and have the opportunity  [0m
[33m to ask for followup.  [0m
[33m I'd recommend that you test this communication method  [0m
[33m while you're testing the other logistics of your study.  [0m
[33m If you're in-person, that means things  [0m
[33m like making sure the video and audio are recording correctly  [0m
[33m and placement of chairs works.  [0m
[33m If you're using a remote tool  [0m
[33m or conducting an un-moderated session,  [0m
[33m be sure to walk through all the programs and logins.  [0m
[33m No matter what, run a pilot study.  [0m
[33m This will help you double check logistical things  [0m
[33m like accounts, connections, and recording settings,  [0m
[33m catch any unclear questions or awkwardness  [0m
[33m in the question order, and get the truest sense of timing.  [0m
[33m A little extra preparation  [0m
[33m before running usability tests makes them go much smoother.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Tips for moderating effective usability sessions[0m

[33m - Effectively moderating usability tests  [0m
[33m is more art than science,  [0m
[33m and is deceptively simple-seeming.  [0m
[33m The best way to get better at running usability tests  [0m
[33m is to practice, but make sure you keep these tips in mind.  [0m
[33m It's very important to set the stage with participants  [0m
[33m and focus on building rapport early.  [0m
[33m The first few minutes of a session set the tone,  [0m
[33m so aim to help the participants feel  [0m
[33m as comfortable as they can.  [0m
[33m Clearly describe who you are, what your goal is,  [0m
[33m and what your expectations are about the session.  [0m
[33m Reiterate that you are not testing them,  [0m
[33m but you're looking for honest feedback on what works well  [0m
[33m and, more importantly, what doesn't.  [0m
[33m Let them know that you might ask follow-up questions  [0m
[33m that seem obvious, or abstain from  [0m
[33m answering their questions right away.  [0m
[33m They're free to ask for clarification,  [0m
[33m but you won't lead them down a particular path.  [0m
[33m Assuming that you aren't the one who designed  [0m
[33m what you'll be testing, let them know that you'll  [0m
[33m be passing on the feedback to the team,  [0m
[33m and that it's your job to make the overall product better.  [0m
[33m Err on the side of more explanation than not,  [0m
[33m since it's likely that participants won't  [0m
[33m be super familiar with the process,  [0m
[33m and that can be some social pressure  [0m
[33m in the situation to get things right.  [0m
[33m During the sessions, use the tasks and the test plan  [0m
[33m as a guide but not as rote text.  [0m
[33m The best feedback comes from authentic experience,  [0m
[33m so if the opportunity comes to cover a task out of order,  [0m
[33m go for it.  [0m
[33m You may also hear feedback about a related area,  [0m
[33m or unexpected path that you may want to explore.  [0m
[33m Use your judgment and don't abandon the goals of the study.  [0m
[33m But be prepared to be flexible.  [0m
[33m Actively remind yourself to relax as much as possible  [0m
[33m and allow yourself to be personable.  [0m
[33m Participants will take their social cues from you.  [0m
[33m If you appear comfortable,  [0m
[33m they will automatically be more so.  [0m
[33m Just be mindful of your reactions.  [0m
[33m For instance, if you vigorously nod when they  [0m
[33m start talking about things they like,  [0m
[33m they'll continue to do so.  [0m
[33m Try to keep a neutral expression and tone.  [0m
[33m And importantly, remember to talk as little as possible.  [0m
[33m You want to make sure the participants understand  [0m
[33m what you're asking them to do and then you want  [0m
[33m to give them space to go through,  [0m
[33m talk aloud, and work things out.  [0m
[33m Silence is uncomfortable for humans.  [0m
[33m And that's exactly the point.  [0m
[33m See?  [0m
[33m Didn't you think something was wrong?  [0m
[33m We're hardwired to want to fill empty space.  [0m
[33m You want to give the participants the opportunity  [0m
[33m to fill that space, rather than doing so yourself.  [0m
[33m This prevents you from biasing or leading the participants,  [0m
[33m and allows you to uncover new information from them.  [0m
[33m It's okay to repeat information back to participants  [0m
[33m in order to be sure you've heard them correctly.  [0m
[33m Ask for clarifications, or probe on an answer.  [0m
[33m In fact, you'll often get the most insightful information  [0m
[33m by following up on a response and getting people  [0m
[33m to explain the context behind it.  [0m
[33m Aim for open-ended questions and allow the user  [0m
[33m to guide where the discussion goes.  [0m
[33m If you get too off track, you can navigate them back  [0m
[33m with an orienting question about the original task,  [0m
[33m or prompting them to move on to the next.  [0m
[33m I highly recommend watching recorded sessions of yourself.  [0m
[33m It feels totally awkward,  [0m
[33m but even if you think you've done pretty well,  [0m
[33m you're likely to spot a place you could improve.  [0m
[33m Nearly every researcher I know has cringed through hours  [0m
[33m of watching themselves, and been able to improve their flow.  [0m
[33m When reviewing, pay attention to  [0m
[33m the ebb and flow of conversation,  [0m
[33m rather than the respondents particular answers.  [0m
[33m Notice where you jump in early, and look for areas  [0m
[33m you could've stepped back or provided more guidance.  [0m
[33m Moderating well is a tricky balance  [0m
[33m of guiding the discussion without leading  [0m
[33m to answers or getting too far off course.  [0m
[33m Give yourself time to prepare,  [0m
[33m find opportunities to practice,  [0m
[33m and constantly evaluate your sessions to improve.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m3[0m[33m. Analyzing the Test[0m

[33m### Identifying and sharing true insights[0m

[33m - Regardless of what sort of usability test your ran,  [0m
[33m you're likely to end up with a big set of raw data  [0m
[33m to analyze and synthesize into findings and recommendations.  [0m
[33m There's a lot of content out there  [0m
[33m about how to analyze usability test data,  [0m
[33m but the bigger challenge and real opportunity  [0m
[33m is in prioritizing your insights  [0m
[33m and turning them into actionable change.  [0m
[33m To help with this, I like to categorize insights  [0m
[33m by size and impact,  [0m
[33m and adjust how I present them accordingly.  [0m
[33m Very generally, I think of insights being on a continuum  [0m
[33m or immediate term practical application  [0m
[33m to longer term larger scale impact.  [0m
[33m On the immediate term end,  [0m
[33m you might have things like users expecting  [0m
[33m a different interaction for a particular pattern,  [0m
[33m or going to the wrong spot  [0m
[33m to look for something consistently.  [0m
[33m You know you can provide a tactical recommendation  [0m
[33m that would address that issue  [0m
[33m with a relatively small effort.  [0m
[33m For instance, say we were running a test  [0m
[33m on an account settings page  [0m
[33m and found that users got confused between two icons.  [0m
[33m We could recommend changing at least one of the icons  [0m
[33m and then retesting.  [0m
[33m For this sort of feedback, I clearly identified the issue,  [0m
[33m the recommendation, the next step,  [0m
[33m and then I often share directly with the team  [0m
[33m to make changes.  [0m
[33m In the right circumstances, I'll even go so far  [0m
[33m as to immediately add it to the backlog  [0m
[33m for the team who would address it.  [0m
[33m While, of course you want there to be wide visibility  [0m
[33m into what you've found,  [0m
[33m your primary goal with this sort of finding  [0m
[33m is to provide straightforward, tactical advice  [0m
[33m that the team can implement right away.  [0m
[33m On the other end of the spectrum are larger scale insights  [0m
[33m that might influence the direction  [0m
[33m of the whole product or project.  [0m
[33m You might not know an immediate solution  [0m
[33m or even know the impact,  [0m
[33m but you've gotten a clue that you need to dig deeper.  [0m
[33m For instance, you might learn that your target users  [0m
[33m can easily perform the tasks that you've asked them to do,  [0m
[33m but they report that their goals are shifting  [0m
[33m and they don't do some of those tasks anymore.  [0m
[33m In this case, there won't be straightforward recommendations  [0m
[33m for the team to take next.  [0m
[33m Instead, you're likely going to shift into advocate mode,  [0m
[33m pushing for further, deeper research  [0m
[33m to help guide the next steps.  [0m
[33m You still want to report what you've found,  [0m
[33m but you want to present the findings as a pathway to explore,  [0m
[33m not as final steps.  [0m
[33m This means the format to share your insights may change.  [0m
[33m Rather than writing a straightforward report  [0m
[33m or adding items to a backlog,  [0m
[33m you might want to make presentations to larger teams  [0m
[33m or higher level stakeholders,  [0m
[33m or schedule brainstorming sessions.  [0m
[33m Especially when presenting the sort  [0m
[33m of larger, more strategic insight,  [0m
[33m it's important to tailor the information to your audience  [0m
[33m and find ways to connect it to larger business  [0m
[33m and emotional context.  [0m
[33m This is where it might be useful  [0m
[33m to have video of a frustrated user  [0m
[33m or a sound clip declaring total disinterest.  [0m
[33m You should always be serving as the champion for the users,  [0m
[33m but insights that require further work  [0m
[33m also require further advocacy.  [0m
[33m You're also likely to have insights  [0m
[33m that fall in the middle of the spectrum.  [0m
[33m Say you've clearly identified a core usability issue  [0m
[33m but you're not sure of the design pattern to move forward  [0m
[33m and need to advocate some more solution exploration.  [0m
[33m No one kind of insight is more important than the other.  [0m
[33m It's important to understand the relative categories  [0m
[33m and be pragmatic for the situation that you're in.  [0m
[33m Remember that the format of sharing your findings  [0m
[33m is more dependent on the team and organizational structure  [0m
[33m than the type of finding.  [0m
[33m It's your job to help your team understand  [0m
[33m and utilize what you've learned in a way that makes sense.  [0m
[33m [0m

[33m## Usability Testing[0m

[33m### All about usability testing[0m

[33m - Usability testing is one  [0m
[33m of the most commonly used UX research methods,  [0m
[33m and for good reason.  [0m
[33m Usability testing is the gold standard  [0m
[33m for evaluative research, and it's a flexible enough method  [0m
[33m to gather a variety of data.  [0m
[33m It's pretty easy to get started,  [0m
[33m but it's also easy to get caught up in some common pitfalls.  [0m
[33m I'm Amanda Stockwell.  [0m
[33m Welcome to the Usability Test Deep Dive.  [0m
[33m This course is for those of us who are already familiar  [0m
[33m with the basics of usability testing,  [0m
[33m and want to level up skills  [0m
[33m to be even more effective researchers.  [0m
[33m Join me as I discuss strategic considerations  [0m
[33m and practical tips to help you get the most out  [0m

[33m### Recap of usability testing[0m

[33m - A usability test is simply a tool to evaluate the ease  [0m
[33m of use of a product, service, or interface.  [0m
[33m At the core, a usability test involves observing  [0m
[33m representative users as they perform tasks,  [0m
[33m and assessing their experience and interactions.  [0m
[33m Like most UX tools, there are many variations,  [0m
[33m and it's important to understand those nuances  [0m
[33m so you can plan for your particular situation.  [0m
[33m While the general goal of usability testing  [0m
[33m is to assess usability, you might be doing so  [0m
[33m in vastly different contexts that change  [0m
[33m how you ought to plan, run, and analyze the sessions.  [0m
[33m If you're not already familiar with usability testing,  [0m
[33m now would be a great time to check out UX Foundations:  [0m
[33m Usability Testing, which covers the basics.  [0m
[33m In this course, I want to guide you through a discussion  [0m
[33m of different types of usability tests and their usage,  [0m
[33m and share things I've learned over more  [0m
[33m than a decade conducting usability tests.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m. Which Type of Test?[0m

[33m### Usability test locations[0m

[33m - Before we start diving into the specifics  [0m
[33m of running usability tests,  [0m
[33m let's take a step back to examine  [0m
[33m the types of usability tests, so we can understand  [0m
[33m the nuances and set ourselves up for success.  [0m
[33m The first variant in the usability test is location.  [0m
[33m Usability tests are traditionally conducted in person,  [0m
[33m meaning that you are physically sitting  [0m
[33m next to the participant during the session.  [0m
[33m In-person sessions have traditionally been run  [0m
[33m in a usability lab, where you have a dedicated room  [0m
[33m for the moderator and participant  [0m
[33m that has audio and video recording,  [0m
[33m and another room for observers,  [0m
[33m where the information is streamed.  [0m
[33m Yes, I'm talking the dreaded one-way mirror set up.  [0m
[33m These Labs might be at a third-party research facility,  [0m
[33m or even just a dedicated room of an office.  [0m
[33m If you don't have a lab, or need to bring the research  [0m
[33m to the participants, you might still conduct the sessions  [0m
[33m physically next to the participants.  [0m
[33m That could be as simple as sitting next to someone  [0m
[33m at their desk, or meeting them at a third-party location  [0m
[33m like a library or coworking space.  [0m
[33m You can still record audio and maybe video.  [0m
[33m It's just not quite as formal of a dedicated space.  [0m
[33m In recent years, it's also become much more possible  [0m
[33m and popular conduct usability tests remotely,  [0m
[33m meaning that you're connected digitally,  [0m
[33m but not physically present with the participants.  [0m
[33m There are many good video conferencing tools  [0m
[33m that allow you to see participants' faces  [0m
[33m and share and record the screen of any member of the party.  [0m
[33m So how to decide where to conduct sessions?  [0m
[33m Well, the answer as with most things in UX,  [0m
[33m is that it depends.  [0m
[33m Being in the same space as your participants  [0m
[33m has several benefits and is often seen as the gold standard.  [0m
[33m One large benefit is that you can more easily  [0m
[33m build rapport with participants.  [0m
[33m You can shake their hand, look them in the eye,  [0m
[33m smile and greet them.  [0m
[33m You may make a bit of small talk and be able  [0m
[33m to feel them out before you get too far into the session.  [0m
[33m More on this later.  [0m
[33m You can also observe their body language  [0m
[33m and facial expressions, which don't always match  [0m
[33m what they'll say.  [0m
[33m We'll talk more about that too.  [0m
[33m The lab setting is great for this kind of close observation  [0m
[33m and allows you to easily record audio and video  [0m
[33m so you can widely share and later revisit the sessions.  [0m
[33m It's also easier to use lower fidelity artifacts  [0m
[33m like paper prototypes if you're physically with someone  [0m
[33m and can provide some extra context.  [0m
[33m However, a lab isn't the ideal setting when the context  [0m
[33m someone is working in will greatly impact  [0m
[33m how they use something.  [0m
[33m Say you're working on improvements to a traffic  [0m
[33m and navigation app.  [0m
[33m How someone acts looking at an app while sitting  [0m
[33m at a table, may be very different than when  [0m
[33m they're trying to navigate rush hour traffic in their car.  [0m
[33m The category of research where you observe people  [0m
[33m in their own space is called ethnography.  [0m
[33m While it can create logistical challenges,  [0m
[33m it can also help you paint a richer picture  [0m
[33m of your user and how they use your product in context.  [0m
[33m If you don't have the budget to conduct formal recruiting,  [0m
[33m or don't have access to a dedicated space,  [0m
[33m you might use the guerrilla tactics of intercepting people  [0m
[33m in a public setting.  [0m
[33m Recruiting and conducting sessions in public spaces  [0m
[33m is best for when your product doesn't require  [0m
[33m particular domain expertise, you're not testing  [0m
[33m particularly sensitive material,  [0m
[33m and your budget doesn't leave you another option.  [0m
[33m On the other hand, even if you do have the opportunity  [0m
[33m to meet participants in person,  [0m
[33m remote sessions can have some advantages.  [0m
[33m The first is that remote work allows you  [0m
[33m to access participants who are geographically spread out  [0m
[33m without extra time or costs.  [0m
[33m The world is ever shrinking, and many of our products  [0m
[33m and services serve a large base of people.  [0m
[33m It's essential to be sure that you're incorporating  [0m
[33m feedback from multiple cultures, locations and contexts  [0m
[33m so as not to bias your results.  [0m
[33m Conducting sessions remotely can also save  [0m
[33m both the research team and the participant's time.  [0m
[33m You cut out commuting and set up time,  [0m
[33m and it can allow the researcher to more flexibly schedule  [0m
[33m sessions over a period of time.  [0m
[33m You could even conduct a few sessions  [0m
[33m of a research series in person and a few remotely,  [0m
[33m in order to access the participants you need.  [0m
[33m Or alternate between in-person and remote efforts  [0m
[33m depending on timing and resources.  [0m
[33m Consider switching it up occasionally to try out  [0m
[33m different methods and compare the results.  [0m
[33m Before you plan your usability test,  [0m
[33m carefully consider the context of your project  [0m
[33m and what location would be most beneficial and realistic.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Moderated vs. unmoderated usability tests[0m

[33m - Along with the option to conduct sessions remotely,  [0m
[33m more and more tools have been popping up  [0m
[33m to conduct unmoderated sessions,  [0m
[33m where you write out individual tasks for the users,  [0m
[33m and the participants complete each task on their own time.  [0m
[33m A tool provides the instructions, shows the questions,  [0m
[33m and records the actions of the user.  [0m
[33m There is no direct interaction between the participants  [0m
[33m and the researcher, which means that you need to plan  [0m
[33m unmoderated sessions even more carefully.  [0m
[33m They're also most appropriate for certain scenarios only.  [0m
[33m Because you pre-write the introduction, the core tasks,  [0m
[33m and the followup questions, unmoderated tests  [0m
[33m are best for live or very functional work  [0m
[33m that requires very little explanation.  [0m
[33m When you show a low fidelity or early stage prototype  [0m
[33m in person, you can explain limitations and provide context  [0m
[33m along the way.  [0m
[33m It's possible to navigate around known issues  [0m
[33m or work around empty areas when you moderate.  [0m
[33m Unmoderated sessions are best suited  [0m
[33m for straightforward, clear tasks  [0m
[33m that don't leave much room for interpretation,  [0m
[33m like assessing how easily someone can find  [0m
[33m a certain sort of a product on an eCommerce page,  [0m
[33m or how long it takes to check out  [0m
[33m on one site versus another.  [0m
[33m Participants are frequently put into artificial situations  [0m
[33m in usability tests anyway, but without a moderator present,  [0m
[33m it's even easier to fake things or tune out.  [0m
[33m Tasks that require emotional engagement or creativity  [0m
[33m are unlikely to get an authentic response  [0m
[33m in an unmoderated test.  [0m
[33m You also need to carefully construct the tasks  [0m
[33m to be sure they will get you the results you want.  [0m
[33m Turning goals into clear tasks already takes practice  [0m
[33m to master, and all the normal best practices apply.  [0m
[33m But writing unmoderated tasks is even more difficult.  [0m
[33m You have to explicit about you want the participant to do  [0m
[33m and when they should stop.  [0m
[33m And provide clear, specific, and realistic instructions,  [0m
[33m all without being too obvious.  [0m
[33m Make sure the tasks are written  [0m
[33m as directions, not questions.  [0m
[33m And be precise in the instruction.  [0m
[33m Let's say we were testing the LinkedIn Learning site.  [0m
[33m A good task might be something like,  [0m
[33m find a UX related LinkedIn Learning course  [0m
[33m you haven't yet watched, and stop when you get  [0m
[33m to a brief description of the course.  [0m
[33m Remember, participants won't have a chance to clarify,  [0m
[33m and you won't have a chance to probe.  [0m
[33m So if they misinterpret, the task may be wasted.  [0m
[33m It's especially important to pilot test unmoderated studies  [0m
[33m so that you can get the most authentic useful feedback.  [0m
[33m You also don't get the chance to probe,  [0m
[33m so make sure you include followup questions  [0m
[33m that are just as thoughtfully crafted.  [0m
[33m With all those limitations in mind,  [0m
[33m unmoderated studies also have some great benefits.  [0m
[33m You can run sessions in parallel and therefore collect  [0m
[33m many responses in a short amount of time.  [0m
[33m You save time and have access to a much larger  [0m
[33m and more spread out participant base  [0m
[33m than you might otherwise.  [0m
[33m You can usually offer a lower incentive  [0m
[33m to save yourself some money as well.  [0m
[33m I've used unmoderated studies to get super quick feedback  [0m
[33m from across the globe literally overnight.  [0m
[33m Everything from response to a new design direction,  [0m
[33m to interpretation of messaging options, to gut-checking  [0m
[33m which of an interaction pattern best suited our goals.  [0m
[33m These broad, quick studies have been especially useful  [0m
[33m when working in agile settings,  [0m
[33m and we needed data super fast.  [0m
[33m I also like to use unmoderated studies  [0m
[33m when I'm benchmarking and comparing the results over time.  [0m
[33m That makes it easy to set up  [0m
[33m and assures the questions remain consistent.  [0m
[33m As always, carefully consider the core goal  [0m
[33m and context of your research goals  [0m
[33m to determine the right kind of test for you.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Using usability tests to explore[0m

[33m - As we've discussed,  [0m
[33m usability tests involve observing representative users  [0m
[33m as they perform tasks.  [0m
[33m We typically think of this as evaluative research,  [0m
[33m which is meant to assess how well a solution works.  [0m
[33m We've also been discussing the need to carefully determine  [0m
[33m and craft realistic scenarios and tasks  [0m
[33m for the users to complete.  [0m
[33m But what if you don't know  [0m
[33m what tasks your users are trying to do in real life?  [0m
[33m What if you don't know what a realistic scenario is?  [0m
[33m There are other research methods  [0m
[33m like diary studies or contextual inquiries,  [0m
[33m to help you uncover user needs and behavior,  [0m
[33m but you can also modify usability test efforts  [0m
[33m to be more generative and help you learn  [0m
[33m about user's contexts.  [0m
[33m To do so, you'll remove the very defined tasks  [0m
[33m from your plan.  [0m
[33m You'll still have research goals and target areas to cover,  [0m
[33m but the tasks will be more general  [0m
[33m and more focused on hearing from the user  [0m
[33m how they accomplished a goal,  [0m
[33m than assessing a particular path for interaction.  [0m
[33m For instance, in a traditional test of an e-commerce site,  [0m
[33m you might have one task that is dedicated  [0m
[33m to assessing the search function and one that is designed  [0m
[33m to get participants to browse with categories.  [0m
[33m In a more exploratory usability test,  [0m
[33m you might ask users  [0m
[33m to generally identify a product that fits their needs  [0m
[33m and then observe which path they take,  [0m
[33m probing along the way  [0m
[33m to understand why they did it that way, what's preferable,  [0m
[33m and understand their decision-making process.  [0m
[33m You still want to understand  [0m
[33m how well the process works for them,  [0m
[33m but you're also evaluating the product or service  [0m
[33m more holistically and getting feedback  [0m
[33m about what they really do,  [0m
[33m rather than breaking it down to assess one piece at a time.  [0m
[33m Because of the need to follow up,  [0m
[33m you'll need to moderate this kind of exploratory test  [0m
[33m and be ready to be flexible during the sessions.  [0m
[33m You may end up uncovering totally new insights  [0m
[33m or discovering areas  [0m
[33m that you hadn't realized needed attention.  [0m
[33m Let's say you're working on a presentation tool  [0m
[33m and ask people to tell you about the images they include.  [0m
[33m You might've thought  [0m
[33m you wanted to explore the editing process  [0m
[33m but find out that your users  [0m
[33m actually don't really like to add pictures.  [0m
[33m Your new goal becomes to better understand that decision  [0m
[33m and learn more about their context,  [0m
[33m rather than to assess the ease of use of the feature,  [0m
[33m they wouldn't use.  [0m
[33m This sort of exploratory formative usability testing,  [0m
[33m can be done at any time there is an existing solution  [0m
[33m and you want to learn more  [0m
[33m about real behavior or motivation users have.  [0m
[33m That doesn't necessarily mean  [0m
[33m you have to test something live,  [0m
[33m but is often done in early stages of a redesign,  [0m
[33m assessment of a live product or early in the process  [0m
[33m of building something brand new.  [0m
[33m Exploratory unstructured usability testing,  [0m
[33m isn't the be-all and end-all way  [0m
[33m to understand user's contexts  [0m
[33m but it can be an extra approach in your research toolbox.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m2[0m[33m. Running the Tests[0m

[33m### Participant recruiting considerations[0m

[33m - Many people who are new to usability testing  [0m
[33m struggle most with questions about the participants.  [0m
[33m Who should you target?  [0m
[33m How many participants do you need?  [0m
[33m And how do you find them?  [0m
[33m There's plenty of material that can guide you  [0m
[33m through the basics.  [0m
[33m Understanding nuances can help you ensure  [0m
[33m you get the right people in your study,  [0m
[33m and therefore, the highest quality results for your team.  [0m
[33m One of the most common questions is who to recruit  [0m
[33m and how exact do you need to be  [0m
[33m in recruiting representative users.  [0m
[33m Lots of new researchers assume  [0m
[33m that you can include any general participant  [0m
[33m to identify usability issues.  [0m
[33m If you're working on something like voting machines  [0m
[33m or a general e-commerce site,  [0m
[33m then yes, your audience truly could be just about anyone.  [0m
[33m Maybe you just need to know which  [0m
[33m of two Add to Cart interactions is easier.  [0m
[33m Any member of the public should be able to provide you  [0m
[33m some feedback there.  [0m
[33m But more than likely, you're building something  [0m
[33m for a specific group of people  [0m
[33m who have a particular set of knowledge and experiences  [0m
[33m that impacts how they interact.  [0m
[33m Let's say you're working on a portal for medical providers  [0m
[33m to communicate context about diagnoses to their patients.  [0m
[33m Nurses and doctors are likely  [0m
[33m to use a more clinical set of language  [0m
[33m and have a deeper understanding  [0m
[33m of how to categorize ailments than a typical patient.  [0m
[33m But the portal needs to work for both type of user.  [0m
[33m Sure, a random person could give you feedback  [0m
[33m on the input part of the tool.  [0m
[33m And you'd likely identify some core issues.  [0m
[33m But you're likely going to miss nuances in the feedback  [0m
[33m that a medical professional would be able to provide.  [0m
[33m The closer your test participants are  [0m
[33m to the real users, the more authentic their feedback  [0m
[33m and higher the quality of insights you'll gain.  [0m
[33m If you have multiple different sets of user types,  [0m
[33m like the patients and providers here,  [0m
[33m make sure that you recruit participants from each group  [0m
[33m to include in your study.  [0m
[33m That leads me to my next recruiting tip,  [0m
[33m which is around the number you really need to include.  [0m
[33m You've probably heard the rule  [0m
[33m that you ought to have five users in your usability study.  [0m
[33m I'm not here to fight with that.  [0m
[33m But I want to shed a little extra light and clarity  [0m
[33m so that you can make the best choice for your work.  [0m
[33m That rule came from work that Jakob Nielson  [0m
[33m and Tom Landauer did in the '90s.  [0m
[33m They created a mathematical model that suggests  [0m
[33m you can find [0m[1;33m85[0m[33m% of usability problems  [0m
[33m after five similar participants.  [0m
[33m They suggested that instead of conducting single,  [0m
[33m large usability tests, the most effective route  [0m
[33m would be to conduct smaller, iterative studies  [0m
[33m with three to five participants each  [0m
[33m to maximize cost and benefit.  [0m
[33m If there are distinct user types,  [0m
[33m they suggest three to four participants  [0m
[33m from each category per round.  [0m
[33m Over the years, that extra contact has been lost  [0m
[33m and people just hear that five is the magic answer.  [0m
[33m Five participants is a good starting point.  [0m
[33m But please keep in mind that you will not find  [0m
[33m every issue after talking to that few participants.  [0m
[33m Furthermore, the rule only applies  [0m
[33m when you're talking about the same type of user.  [0m
[33m And if you're looking to establish baselines  [0m
[33m or compare quantitative data,  [0m
[33m you're likely going to want to increase  [0m
[33m that number even more.  [0m
[33m A good gut check on the right number of participants  [0m
[33m is feedback repetition.  [0m
[33m Once you start to hear the same thing over and over,  [0m
[33m you probably ought to spend your time addressing feedback  [0m
[33m rather than collecting more.  [0m
[33m If you have a more diverse set of users than you thought,  [0m
[33m that could be eight or [0m[1;33m10[0m[33m or even more sessions.  [0m
[33m If you start to hear all the same things  [0m
[33m after just a few participants,  [0m
[33m you can feel confident that you need to address  [0m
[33m those items first.  [0m
[33m Recruiting the right participants  [0m
[33m and getting the right sample size is key  [0m
[33m to making sure your usability sessions  [0m
[33m are the most effective for you.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Usability test logistics and preparation[0m

[33m - While it may seem obvious, carefully thinking  [0m
[33m through the logistics and small details of your study  [0m
[33m can really impact the quality of the data you gather.  [0m
[33m The schedule of the sessions is one  [0m
[33m of the easiest things for you to control,  [0m
[33m and can help make sure you get the most  [0m
[33m out of your sessions.  [0m
[33m I don't recommend more than six sessions  [0m
[33m in a day if you can help it.  [0m
[33m Moderating requires deep attention and it can be exhausting.  [0m
[33m We'll talk more about moderation tips,  [0m
[33m but schedule-wise, the most effective tactic is  [0m
[33m to spread sessions out over at least a few days.  [0m
[33m I also recommend giving yourself ample time  [0m
[33m in between sessions.  [0m
[33m You'll need this time to break for the obvious things,  [0m
[33m like snacks, but you can also use this time  [0m
[33m to take care of distractions, like email,  [0m
[33m touch base with teammates and stakeholders,  [0m
[33m and adjust anything within the test.  [0m
[33m I especially like to schedule a quick debrief  [0m
[33m with observers after each session  [0m
[33m to capture first impressions  [0m
[33m and discuss anything we might want to adjust  [0m
[33m for the next round.  [0m
[33m This built-in time also gives you wiggle room,  [0m
[33m if someone ran late or you're having trouble  [0m
[33m getting a chatty participant to wrap up.  [0m
[33m You'll also want to think through how you communicate  [0m
[33m with observers and stakeholders during the sessions.  [0m
[33m I'd always recommend recording the sessions  [0m
[33m and sharing the video with team members,  [0m
[33m but it's also good to livestream  [0m
[33m and allow others to have the opportunity  [0m
[33m to ask you questions or suggest followups in realtime.  [0m
[33m You might want to set up a group chat or text.  [0m
[33m Just make sure you don't get too distracted  [0m
[33m during the session.  [0m
[33m I recommend that observers document all their questions  [0m
[33m and notes along the way, then send one communication  [0m
[33m to the moderator to circle back to  [0m
[33m at the end of the session.  [0m
[33m Sometimes the questions end up being answered,  [0m
[33m or a new thread is uncovered, but it ensures  [0m
[33m that the stakeholders are engaged and have the opportunity  [0m
[33m to ask for followup.  [0m
[33m I'd recommend that you test this communication method  [0m
[33m while you're testing the other logistics of your study.  [0m
[33m If you're in-person, that means things  [0m
[33m like making sure the video and audio are recording correctly  [0m
[33m and placement of chairs works.  [0m
[33m If you're using a remote tool  [0m
[33m or conducting an un-moderated session,  [0m
[33m be sure to walk through all the programs and logins.  [0m
[33m No matter what, run a pilot study.  [0m
[33m This will help you double check logistical things  [0m
[33m like accounts, connections, and recording settings,  [0m
[33m catch any unclear questions or awkwardness  [0m
[33m in the question order, and get the truest sense of timing.  [0m
[33m A little extra preparation  [0m
[33m before running usability tests makes them go much smoother.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Tips for moderating effective usability sessions[0m

[33m - Effectively moderating usability tests  [0m
[33m is more art than science,  [0m
[33m and is deceptively simple-seeming.  [0m
[33m The best way to get better at running usability tests  [0m
[33m is to practice, but make sure you keep these tips in mind.  [0m
[33m It's very important to set the stage with participants  [0m
[33m and focus on building rapport early.  [0m
[33m The first few minutes of a session set the tone,  [0m
[33m so aim to help the participants feel  [0m
[33m as comfortable as they can.  [0m
[33m Clearly describe who you are, what your goal is,  [0m
[33m and what your expectations are about the session.  [0m
[33m Reiterate that you are not testing them,  [0m
[33m but you're looking for honest feedback on what works well  [0m
[33m and, more importantly, what doesn't.  [0m
[33m Let them know that you might ask follow-up questions  [0m
[33m that seem obvious, or abstain from  [0m
[33m answering their questions right away.  [0m
[33m They're free to ask for clarification,  [0m
[33m but you won't lead them down a particular path.  [0m
[33m Assuming that you aren't the one who designed  [0m
[33m what you'll be testing, let them know that you'll  [0m
[33m be passing on the feedback to the team,  [0m
[33m and that it's your job to make the overall product better.  [0m
[33m Err on the side of more explanation than not,  [0m
[33m since it's likely that participants won't  [0m
[33m be super familiar with the process,  [0m
[33m and that can be some social pressure  [0m
[33m in the situation to get things right.  [0m
[33m During the sessions, use the tasks and the test plan  [0m
[33m as a guide but not as rote text.  [0m
[33m The best feedback comes from authentic experience,  [0m
[33m so if the opportunity comes to cover a task out of order,  [0m
[33m go for it.  [0m
[33m You may also hear feedback about a related area,  [0m
[33m or unexpected path that you may want to explore.  [0m
[33m Use your judgment and don't abandon the goals of the study.  [0m
[33m But be prepared to be flexible.  [0m
[33m Actively remind yourself to relax as much as possible  [0m
[33m and allow yourself to be personable.  [0m
[33m Participants will take their social cues from you.  [0m
[33m If you appear comfortable,  [0m
[33m they will automatically be more so.  [0m
[33m Just be mindful of your reactions.  [0m
[33m For instance, if you vigorously nod when they  [0m
[33m start talking about things they like,  [0m
[33m they'll continue to do so.  [0m
[33m Try to keep a neutral expression and tone.  [0m
[33m And importantly, remember to talk as little as possible.  [0m
[33m You want to make sure the participants understand  [0m
[33m what you're asking them to do and then you want  [0m
[33m to give them space to go through,  [0m
[33m talk aloud, and work things out.  [0m
[33m Silence is uncomfortable for humans.  [0m
[33m And that's exactly the point.  [0m
[33m See?  [0m
[33m Didn't you think something was wrong?  [0m
[33m We're hardwired to want to fill empty space.  [0m
[33m You want to give the participants the opportunity  [0m
[33m to fill that space, rather than doing so yourself.  [0m
[33m This prevents you from biasing or leading the participants,  [0m
[33m and allows you to uncover new information from them.  [0m
[33m It's okay to repeat information back to participants  [0m
[33m in order to be sure you've heard them correctly.  [0m
[33m Ask for clarifications, or probe on an answer.  [0m
[33m In fact, you'll often get the most insightful information  [0m
[33m by following up on a response and getting people  [0m
[33m to explain the context behind it.  [0m
[33m Aim for open-ended questions and allow the user  [0m
[33m to guide where the discussion goes.  [0m
[33m If you get too off track, you can navigate them back  [0m
[33m with an orienting question about the original task,  [0m
[33m or prompting them to move on to the next.  [0m
[33m I highly recommend watching recorded sessions of yourself.  [0m
[33m It feels totally awkward,  [0m
[33m but even if you think you've done pretty well,  [0m
[33m you're likely to spot a place you could improve.  [0m
[33m Nearly every researcher I know has cringed through hours  [0m
[33m of watching themselves, and been able to improve their flow.  [0m
[33m When reviewing, pay attention to  [0m
[33m the ebb and flow of conversation,  [0m
[33m rather than the respondents particular answers.  [0m
[33m Notice where you jump in early, and look for areas  [0m
[33m you could've stepped back or provided more guidance.  [0m
[33m Moderating well is a tricky balance  [0m
[33m of guiding the discussion without leading  [0m
[33m to answers or getting too far off course.  [0m
[33m Give yourself time to prepare,  [0m
[33m find opportunities to practice,  [0m
[33m and constantly evaluate your sessions to improve.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m3[0m[33m. Analyzing the Test[0m

[33m### Identifying and sharing true insights[0m

[33m - Regardless of what sort of usability test your ran,  [0m
[33m you're likely to end up with a big set of raw data  [0m
[33m to analyze and synthesize into findings and recommendations.  [0m
[33m There's a lot of content out there  [0m
[33m about how to analyze usability test data,  [0m
[33m but the bigger challenge and real opportunity  [0m
[33m is in prioritizing your insights  [0m
[33m and turning them into actionable change.  [0m
[33m To help with this, I like to categorize insights  [0m
[33m by size and impact,  [0m
[33m and adjust how I present them accordingly.  [0m
[33m Very generally, I think of insights being on a continuum  [0m
[33m or immediate term practical application  [0m
[33m to longer term larger scale impact.  [0m
[33m On the immediate term end,  [0m
[33m you might have things like users expecting  [0m
[33m a different interaction for a particular pattern,  [0m
[33m or going to the wrong spot  [0m
[33m to look for something consistently.  [0m
[33m You know you can provide a tactical recommendation  [0m
[33m that would address that issue  [0m
[33m with a relatively small effort.  [0m
[33m For instance, say we were running a test  [0m
[33m on an account settings page  [0m
[33m and found that users got confused between two icons.  [0m
[33m We could recommend changing at least one of the icons  [0m
[33m and then retesting.  [0m
[33m For this sort of feedback, I clearly identified the issue,  [0m
[33m the recommendation, the next step,  [0m
[33m and then I often share directly with the team  [0m
[33m to make changes.  [0m
[33m In the right circumstances, I'll even go so far  [0m
[33m as to immediately add it to the backlog  [0m
[33m for the team who would address it.  [0m
[33m While, of course you want there to be wide visibility  [0m
[33m into what you've found,  [0m
[33m your primary goal with this sort of finding  [0m
[33m is to provide straightforward, tactical advice  [0m
[33m that the team can implement right away.  [0m
[33m On the other end of the spectrum are larger scale insights  [0m
[33m that might influence the direction  [0m
[33m of the whole product or project.  [0m
[33m You might not know an immediate solution  [0m
[33m or even know the impact,  [0m
[33m but you've gotten a clue that you need to dig deeper.  [0m
[33m For instance, you might learn that your target users  [0m
[33m can easily perform the tasks that you've asked them to do,  [0m
[33m but they report that their goals are shifting  [0m
[33m and they don't do some of those tasks anymore.  [0m
[33m In this case, there won't be straightforward recommendations  [0m
[33m for the team to take next.  [0m
[33m Instead, you're likely going to shift into advocate mode,  [0m
[33m pushing for further, deeper research  [0m
[33m to help guide the next steps.  [0m
[33m You still want to report what you've found,  [0m
[33m but you want to present the findings as a pathway to explore,  [0m
[33m not as final steps.  [0m
[33m This means the format to share your insights may change.  [0m
[33m Rather than writing a straightforward report  [0m
[33m or adding items to a backlog,  [0m
[33m you might want to make presentations to larger teams  [0m
[33m or higher level stakeholders,  [0m
[33m or schedule brainstorming sessions.  [0m
[33m Especially when presenting the sort  [0m
[33m of larger, more strategic insight,  [0m
[33m it's important to tailor the information to your audience  [0m
[33m and find ways to connect it to larger business  [0m
[33m and emotional context.  [0m
[33m This is where it might be useful  [0m
[33m to have video of a frustrated user  [0m
[33m or a sound clip declaring total disinterest.  [0m
[33m You should always be serving as the champion for the users,  [0m
[33m but insights that require further work  [0m
[33m also require further advocacy.  [0m
[33m You're also likely to have insights  [0m
[33m that fall in the middle of the spectrum.  [0m
[33m Say you've clearly identified a core usability issue  [0m
[33m but you're not sure of the design pattern to move forward  [0m
[33m and need to advocate some more solution exploration.  [0m
[33m No one kind of insight is more important than the other.  [0m
[33m It's important to understand the relative categories  [0m
[33m and be pragmatic for the situation that you're in.  [0m
[33m Remember that the format of sharing your findings  [0m
[33m is more dependent on the team and organizational structure  [0m
[33m than the type of finding.  [0m
[33m It's your job to help your team understand  [0m
[33m and utilize what you've learned in a way that makes sense.  [0m
[33m [0m
