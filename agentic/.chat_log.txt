[33m - The lifeblood of any company is the revenue that you earn  [0m
[33m from a steady stream of paying customers.  [0m
[33m For that, you typically need an effective  [0m
[33m and well-managed sales team.  [0m
[33m That's why in many companies,  [0m
[33m the managers who manage the sales force  [0m
[33m are the single most important employees in the company.  [0m
[33m I'm Drew Boyd  [0m
[33m and I've been in the marketing and sales profession  [0m
[33m for over [0m[1;33m30[0m[33m years.  [0m
[33m I teach sales management to graduate students  [0m
[33m and I help companies improve their commercial effectiveness.  [0m
[33m Whether you have an existing sales force  [0m
[33m or you're starting from scratch to create a new one,  [0m

[33m You'll learn the tools and frameworks on how to recruit,  [0m
[33m motivate, deploy, and measure sales representatives.  [0m
[33m Like marketing, sales management  [0m
[33m is an exciting career field of its own,  [0m
[33m but it takes talent and dedication.  [0m
[33m Through the concepts I'll share with you in this course,  [0m
[33m you'll begin to develop the skills  [0m
[33m to become an outstanding sales manager.  [0m
[33m So join me and let's get started.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m. Understanding Sales Management[0m

[33m### What is sales management?[0m

[33m - Sales management is a comprehensive set of activities  [0m
[33m to create and manage a sales team.  [0m
[33m Think of sales management as a cyclical process.  [0m
[33m It starts by understanding the commercial marketing strategy  [0m
[33m of the firm or business unit,  [0m
[33m and then translating marketing strategy  [0m
[33m into a concise and well-defined sales strategy,  [0m
[33m or what we'll call in this course, the sales task.  [0m
[33m The sales task defines exactly  [0m
[33m what sales representatives need to do to be successful,  [0m
[33m what customers do we call on,  [0m
[33m what products and services do we sell,  [0m
[33m and how to sell them.  [0m
[33m Once the sales task is defined,  [0m
[33m every decision and every action taken by the sales manager  [0m
[33m is shaped by it.  [0m
[33m For example, the next step of the sales management process  [0m
[33m is to create a structure for your sales team.  [0m
[33m How many reps you hire  [0m
[33m and how you deploy them all depends on the sales task.  [0m
[33m Highly successful sales managers  [0m
[33m spend a lot of time recruiting, hiring, training,  [0m
[33m and motivating great salespeople.  [0m
[33m Hey, it's the old saying.  [0m
[33m A players stay A players by hiring  [0m
[33m and developing other A players underneath them.  [0m
[33m Sales management is about getting the best  [0m
[33m and most qualified people for the job.  [0m
[33m Once you have a competent team,  [0m
[33m you create a separate territory for each rep  [0m
[33m and give each rep a quota  [0m
[33m of how much you expect them to sell.  [0m
[33m Now, sales reps don't work for free,  [0m
[33m so the sales manager needs  [0m
[33m to structure a compensation program  [0m
[33m that rewards reps for doing the right things to succeed.  [0m
[33m Sales compensation is linked  [0m
[33m to just about every other aspect of sales management,  [0m
[33m so you need to know how this powerful tool works.  [0m
[33m Finally, sales managers measure results  [0m
[33m and they hold their team accountable for those results,  [0m
[33m but the key is to measure the right things  [0m
[33m that link to the sales task.  [0m
[33m Ultimately, measuring sales results feeds right back  [0m
[33m into the marketing team so they can take these results,  [0m
[33m adjust the commercial strategy,  [0m
[33m and start the sales management cycle all over again.  [0m
[33m Sales management is not just patting people on the back  [0m
[33m and telling them to go out there and do their best.  [0m
[33m It's a disciplined managerial method based on data  [0m
[33m and a well-defined process to keep your company successful  [0m
[33m in the face of stiff competition.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Defining the sales task[0m

[33m - Defining the sales task is the first  [0m
[33m and most important step  [0m
[33m in the sales management process.  [0m
[33m A well-defined sales task lays down the foundation  [0m
[33m upon which everything else is built.  [0m
[33m There are four questions you answer  [0m
[33m to define the sales task.  [0m
[33m First, which customers are we going after?  [0m
[33m Now, it may seem obvious  [0m
[33m but salespeople are more effective  [0m
[33m when they have a clear target.  [0m
[33m And the more detailed you can be, the better.  [0m
[33m For example, if you're selling medical equipment  [0m
[33m to hospitals, your direction might sound like this.  [0m
[33m Call on all purchasing managers  [0m
[33m in hospitals with more than [0m[1;33m100[0m[33m beds  [0m
[33m within these zip codes.  [0m
[33m Next, you decide what products  [0m
[33m and services you want the team to sell.  [0m
[33m Now, once again, the more detailed you can be, the better.  [0m
[33m Using our medical example,  [0m
[33m your direction might be this.  [0m
[33m Sell diagnostic equipment to cancer centers,  [0m
[33m sell surgical equipment to community hospitals.  [0m
[33m And so on.  [0m
[33m Now, this is where the sales manager  [0m
[33m and the marketing team must be in sync.  [0m
[33m The third part of the sales task defines exactly  [0m
[33m what activities must be accomplished  [0m
[33m to sell a product to a customer.  [0m
[33m How many calls do you want your sales reps to make  [0m
[33m to each customer and what do you want them to do  [0m
[33m when they meet with a customer?  [0m
[33m For example, do you want them  [0m
[33m to demonstrate the product?  [0m
[33m Ask customers about their needs?  [0m
[33m Perhaps negotiate pricing.  [0m
[33m Get commitments.  [0m
[33m Take orders, follow up with customers and so on.  [0m
[33m Hey, don't leave it up to your sales reps  [0m
[33m to figure it out.  [0m
[33m Defining what you want done during the selling process  [0m
[33m will make them more efficient and more effective.  [0m
[33m And finally, what communications do you want your team  [0m
[33m to report back to your company?  [0m
[33m Hey, sales reps tend to work independently  [0m
[33m in most situations  [0m
[33m but they still need to have connections back  [0m
[33m to certain departments within your company.  [0m
[33m For example, sales reps might need interaction  [0m
[33m with a customer service center,  [0m
[33m a shipping department or perhaps a financing  [0m
[33m and leasing team.  [0m
[33m It depends on the nature of your business, of course,  [0m
[33m but sales reps need to have a clear understanding  [0m
[33m of where to get support and help  [0m
[33m to get the job done.  [0m
[33m You don't want them running around trying  [0m
[33m to figure out who to call to solve a problem.  [0m
[33m That takes away valuable selling time  [0m
[33m from the field and that will lower your sales.  [0m
[33m Using our medical example,  [0m
[33m you might specify that reps have regular contact  [0m
[33m with your medical affairs department,  [0m
[33m your ordering and supply staff  [0m
[33m and the marketing team  [0m
[33m when they get specific questions  [0m
[33m from hospital staff members.  [0m
[33m Who do we target?  [0m
[33m What do we sell? How do we sell it?  [0m
[33m And where do we go for support?  [0m
[33m You'll hear me refer to the sales tasks  [0m
[33m throughout the rest of this course  [0m
[33m because it's such a critical component  [0m
[33m of your success as a sales manager.  [0m

[33m## [0m[1;33m2[0m[33m. Acquiring Sales Talent[0m

[33m### Recruiting salespeople[0m

[33m - Recruiting and hiring sales reps is so important  [0m
[33m that the best sales managers get actively involved  [0m
[33m in the process.  [0m
[33m They see recruiting as an ongoing activity  [0m
[33m so they always have qualified candidates  [0m
[33m who can step right in to an open position.  [0m
[33m Here are the steps you take to hire sales reps.  [0m
[33m First, develop a profile of the type of person  [0m
[33m who can perform the sales task.  [0m
[33m Look closely at the sales task and ask yourself,  [0m
[33m what skills does a rep need  [0m
[33m or be able to acquire to do the job?  [0m
[33m Do they need technical skills, quantitative skills,  [0m
[33m presentation skills and so on?  [0m
[33m For example, selling medical products  [0m
[33m might require skills related to medical procedures  [0m
[33m but selling financial services  [0m
[33m might require more skills in presentation and negotiation.  [0m
[33m Also ask what knowledge is needed to do the job.  [0m
[33m Do they need knowledge about your industry  [0m
[33m or perhaps knowledge about a certain topic,  [0m
[33m such as biology or engineering?  [0m
[33m And finally, what dispositions and behaviors  [0m
[33m do they need for the job?  [0m
[33m Do you want people with high energy  [0m
[33m or perhaps people who are more easy going  [0m
[33m and great at forming relationships?  [0m
[33m Now, once you have a profile,  [0m
[33m work with your HR team to create a job description,  [0m
[33m which includes elements of the profile,  [0m
[33m along with job duties as described in the sales task.  [0m
[33m Now, depending on the job,  [0m
[33m there are lots of sources of potential sales recruits.  [0m
[33m Start by looking inside your own company.  [0m
[33m You might be surprised  [0m
[33m at how that quiet, shy engineer  [0m
[33m could become a superstar salesperson.  [0m
[33m Your own employees already know your products  [0m
[33m and industry, so they're an excellent source  [0m
[33m to fill openings.  [0m
[33m Other sources include referrals,  [0m
[33m staffing agencies, universities,  [0m
[33m former military personnel,  [0m
[33m internet job and networking sites,  [0m
[33m and, of course, traditional newspaper advertising.  [0m
[33m As you get people applying for the job,  [0m
[33m it's time to start interviewing.  [0m
[33m And I recommend creating an interview script  [0m
[33m that focuses on what reps need to do  [0m
[33m to perform the sales task.  [0m
[33m Sales managers use two types of interview scripts.  [0m
[33m First are called the situation  [0m
[33m or behavior-based interviews.  [0m
[33m If the sales task requires reps  [0m
[33m to respond to certain situations,  [0m
[33m ask interview questions  [0m
[33m that focus on those situations.  [0m
[33m Here's an example of this type of interview question.  [0m
[33m A potential customer just told you  [0m
[33m that you didn't get the order.  [0m
[33m What do you do now?  [0m
[33m And how do you respond?  [0m
[33m With this question,  [0m
[33m you would want to hear that the rep is tactful,  [0m
[33m professional and appreciative  [0m
[33m but they also try to find out the reasons  [0m
[33m why they were not given the business.  [0m
[33m The other approach is performance-based interviews.  [0m
[33m Here you give the candidate exercises  [0m
[33m that simulate a selling situation  [0m
[33m or activity in the sales task.  [0m
[33m For example, you might hand a candidate an everyday product  [0m
[33m and ask them to describe its features and benefits.  [0m
[33m When you find the right candidate,  [0m
[33m make the offer and be ready to negotiate.  [0m
[33m Salespeople want more than anything  [0m
[33m to feel that they are valued.  [0m
[33m Send that message from the very start  [0m
[33m with a fair but strong employment offer.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Conducting sales training[0m

[33m - A formal sales training program  [0m
[33m is one of the best ways  [0m
[33m you can assure success of your sales team.  [0m
[33m Here's how to create one.  [0m
[33m Take your sales task and break it down  [0m
[33m into an exhaustive list of specific skills,  [0m
[33m knowledge, and behaviors they must acquire in training.  [0m
[33m Now, remember you did something similar  [0m
[33m during the recruiting process,  [0m
[33m to create a job description and a hiring template,  [0m
[33m but this time you want to make the lists  [0m
[33m as complete as possible.  [0m
[33m So think of it this way.  [0m
[33m If you hire people with some existing skills,  [0m
[33m knowledge, and behaviors,  [0m
[33m then your training program is designed  [0m
[33m to reinforce those, as well as fill in the gaps.  [0m
[33m You want people walking out of your training program  [0m
[33m ready to perform the sales task.  [0m
[33m So here's an example for a rep selling surgical instruments.  [0m
[33m The skills list would include call planning,  [0m
[33m giving presentations, demonstrating products,  [0m
[33m gaining commitments, and taking orders.  [0m
[33m The knowledge list has human anatomy,  [0m
[33m surgical procedures, operating room protocols,  [0m
[33m and the surgeon profession.  [0m
[33m And finally, the behaviors include self-motivated,  [0m
[33m professional, organized, engaging,  [0m
[33m and, of course, persuasive.  [0m
[33m Now, using these lists create a series of training modules  [0m
[33m design to deliver or reinforce each item.  [0m
[33m To deliver the training, you have a lot of options.  [0m
[33m The most obvious source is to select  [0m
[33m one of your star performing sales reps,  [0m
[33m but be careful here.  [0m
[33m When you take a great rep out of the field to do training,  [0m
[33m it could impact your sales.  [0m
[33m Other options include sales managers,  [0m
[33m marketing managers, your technical teams,  [0m
[33m or even your customers.  [0m
[33m Look at each module and determine  [0m
[33m who is most qualified to do the job.  [0m
[33m In some companies,  [0m
[33m it makes sense to create internal positions  [0m
[33m as sales trainers who do it all.  [0m
[33m You might even consider hiring  [0m
[33m outside sales training specialist.  [0m
[33m Now, most sales training programs  [0m
[33m involve some type of role playing,  [0m
[33m so that reps can practice the exact skills  [0m
[33m expected of them in the field.  [0m
[33m The key is to make training and experience  [0m
[33m that translates directly  [0m
[33m into what they'll have to do in the field.  [0m
[33m Now, where are you delivered training,  [0m
[33m is another key question.  [0m
[33m Consider each module and ask yourself  [0m
[33m what location would make the most impact on learning.  [0m
[33m For example, would it make sense  [0m
[33m to do training in the field?  [0m
[33m Perhaps at a customer's location,  [0m
[33m or at a distributor of your product.  [0m
[33m More and more companies are delivering training online.  [0m
[33m For example, take a look at the variety of sales courses  [0m
[33m here on LinkedIn Learning.  [0m
[33m A sales training program motivates your reps,  [0m
[33m and shows the company's commitment to their success.  [0m
[33m But most importantly,  [0m
[33m it gets them off to a fast start to go out  [0m
[33m and build your business.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Motivating salespeople[0m

[33m - Perhaps the hardest part of the sales job  [0m
[33m is how to stay motivated.  [0m
[33m And that's where you, the sales manager comes in.  [0m
[33m Creating competency means hiring and training  [0m
[33m great salespeople, but it also means keeping them motivated.  [0m
[33m Why motivate?  [0m
[33m Well, it creates enthusiasm for the job  [0m
[33m and reduces job turnover.  [0m
[33m Motivated reps are more productive and more confident  [0m
[33m in their ability to accomplish the sales task.  [0m
[33m Motivated reps get less frustrated and they stay on track  [0m
[33m to get the job done.  [0m
[33m The most successful sales managers use a combination  [0m
[33m of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards to motivate salespeople.  [0m
[33m Intrinsic rewards include giving reps autonomy and freedom  [0m
[33m to do their jobs,  [0m
[33m reminding them that they are selling interesting and useful  [0m
[33m products that help their customers,  [0m
[33m and giving them a sense that the company is loyal to them.  [0m
[33m Extrinsic rewards can be both financial and nonfinancial,  [0m
[33m and these include salary and bonuses,  [0m
[33m sales awards like rings and plaques,  [0m
[33m special titles like senior sales rep  [0m
[33m and just the good old pat on the back.  [0m
[33m Sales reps are very motivated by recognition  [0m
[33m as it reinforces their choice to work hard.  [0m
[33m But sometimes the lack of recognition  [0m
[33m can be just as powerful,  [0m
[33m when a rep sees his colleagues winning sales awards  [0m
[33m and they have it.  [0m
[33m So schedule regular events to recognize successful reps  [0m
[33m in front of others.  [0m
[33m Arrange to have the senior leaders in your company,  [0m
[33m especially the CEO,  [0m
[33m take the time to visit with the top reps and thank them.  [0m
[33m Reps want to feel useful, important, and worthwhile.  [0m
[33m So get them involved in things like your training programs.  [0m
[33m Invite them to important sales planning meetings.  [0m
[33m Have them mentor newly hired sales reps,  [0m
[33m or perhaps ask them to be part of a sales advisory council  [0m
[33m for your company.  [0m
[33m Another great way to motivate sales reps  [0m
[33m is to conduct sales contests.  [0m
[33m Now these are short term incentive programs that award  [0m
[33m prizes to reps that achieve specific sales targets.  [0m
[33m These might include getting new accounts,  [0m
[33m selling certain products or gathering specific types  [0m
[33m of information from the market.  [0m
[33m For many reps, the best motivation of all  [0m
[33m comes from customer feedback.  [0m
[33m It's very powerful because it reminds the rep  [0m
[33m of the direct impact of their efforts.  [0m
[33m So here's a tip.  [0m
[33m Next time you have a sales award meeting,  [0m
[33m invite the winning rep's customer to the event,  [0m
[33m to say a few words about the rep and to personally  [0m
[33m hand over the award.  [0m
[33m Now that will put a smile on the rep's face for sure.  [0m
[33m Oh, and there's another important benefit  [0m
[33m to motivating your sales reps.  [0m
[33m If you selected and train talented salespeople,  [0m
[33m keeping them motivated is the best way  [0m
[33m to assure your success.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m3[0m[33m. Creating a Sales Structure[0m

[33m### Defining a sales force structure[0m

[33m - Creating a sales structure means deciding  [0m
[33m how many sales reps you need and how to organize them.  [0m
[33m There are two ways to decide how many reps you need.  [0m
[33m A top-down approach means you take  [0m
[33m your total annual revenue goal  [0m
[33m and divide it by the average sales per customer.  [0m
[33m For example, if your sales goal is $[0m[1;33m1[0m[33m million,  [0m
[33m and the average sales is $[0m[1;33m1[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m dollars, and you need to  [0m
[33m call on these customers at least five times a year,  [0m
[33m well, then you need to have enough reps  [0m
[33m to make [0m[1;33m5[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m sales calls.  [0m
[33m If the average rep can make [0m[1;33m500[0m[33m calls per year,  [0m
[33m which is about two per day,  [0m
[33m then you'll need at least [0m[1;33m10[0m[33m sales reps.  [0m
[33m The other approach is from the bottom up.  [0m
[33m Look at the total number of customers or accounts you have  [0m
[33m in your geographic area, decide how many calls  [0m
[33m you need to make on each one to generate a sale.  [0m
[33m For example, if you have [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m customers in your area,  [0m
[33m and they need to be called on five times a year,  [0m
[33m well, that means your sales team needs to do [0m[1;33m5[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m calls.  [0m
[33m And then just like before, divide that by the total number  [0m
[33m of calls one rep can make in a year.  [0m
[33m That gives you the total number of reps needed to cover  [0m
[33m all those customers in that geographic area.  [0m
[33m And as before, if the average rep can make [0m[1;33m500[0m[33m calls  [0m
[33m per year, you'll need at least [0m[1;33m10[0m[33m reps to cover this area.  [0m
[33m Once you've decided on the number of reps,  [0m
[33m you need to decide how to organize them.  [0m
[33m Do you want them to be product focused,  [0m
[33m customer focused, or geographic focused?  [0m
[33m Now here's a nice tool to help you decide.  [0m
[33m It's a matrix that pairs the products you have  [0m
[33m with the types of customers you have.  [0m
[33m For each combination, you decide on the sales task.  [0m
[33m So for example, sales task A1 describes what a rep does  [0m
[33m to sell product A to customer type one.  [0m
[33m Let's use our medical example.  [0m
[33m Let's assume we sell diagnostic products,  [0m
[33m surgical instruments, and medical supplies.  [0m
[33m And we want to reach hospitals, clinics,  [0m
[33m and doctor's offices.  [0m
[33m The sales task would be defined  [0m
[33m for each of these combinations.  [0m
[33m Now look closely at the sales task in each column.  [0m
[33m If columns are similar, then you organize by product.  [0m
[33m For example, if sales tasks A1, A2, and A3 are the same,  [0m
[33m you would want to create sales reps who just specialize  [0m
[33m on selling diagnostic equipment to all types of accounts.  [0m
[33m Now look across the rows.  [0m
[33m For example, if sales tasks A1, B1, and C1 are the same,  [0m
[33m you would want to create sales reps who specialize  [0m
[33m just on hospitals, selling all three types of products.  [0m
[33m So what do you do if all the sales tasks  [0m
[33m in the entire matrix are the same?  [0m
[33m Well, then you organize your reps by geography.  [0m
[33m All reps sell all products to all account types  [0m
[33m in your entire area.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Forecasting sales performance[0m

[33m - To create territories, you first need to forecast  [0m
[33m both the market potential  [0m
[33m and the sales potential in your areas.  [0m
[33m Market potential is what you and all the companies like you  [0m
[33m expect to sell in that area.  [0m
[33m It's the potential sales  [0m
[33m for your entire industry in that area.  [0m
[33m Sales potential, on the other hand,  [0m
[33m is what your company expects to earn  [0m
[33m out of that total market potential.  [0m
[33m In other words, it's your share of the market.  [0m
[33m Now, forecasts can be based on  [0m
[33m objective data or subjective data.  [0m
[33m Objective methods look at past historical data  [0m
[33m as an indicator of future performance.  [0m
[33m For example, you might look  [0m
[33m at the last several years of company sales,  [0m
[33m and this would tell you if the company's sales  [0m
[33m are growing, staying flat, or perhaps declining.  [0m
[33m And based on that, you'll have to decide  [0m
[33m where those trends will continue,  [0m
[33m or if there is something you're planning to do  [0m
[33m that will change those trends.  [0m
[33m Subjective techniques are based on the opinions of experts.  [0m
[33m Now, these could be individuals or groups  [0m
[33m responding to a survey,  [0m
[33m or perhaps in face-to-face interviews.  [0m
[33m These experts might be your customers,  [0m
[33m your sales reps, or perhaps your distributors.  [0m
[33m Once you decide on the sources of data for your forecast,  [0m
[33m you need to decide on what approach to use.  [0m
[33m And two options I recommend  [0m
[33m are the top-down approach and the bottom up approach.  [0m
[33m With the top-down approach,  [0m
[33m you start at the national economic level  [0m
[33m to assess the overall condition of the economy.  [0m
[33m Is the economy growing or shrinking?  [0m
[33m Why you ask?  [0m
[33m Well, it can affect sales in your particular industry.  [0m
[33m Next, look at your industry potential.  [0m
[33m Are there factors affecting your industry  [0m
[33m positively or negatively?  [0m
[33m Are there new foreign competitors or new regulations  [0m
[33m that might hurt sales?  [0m
[33m From there, estimate your share of the industry pie.  [0m
[33m That is your company's sales potential  [0m
[33m that you will break down further into territories.  [0m
[33m Now, the bottom-up approach is just the opposite.  [0m
[33m With this approach, you start by asking each sales rep  [0m
[33m to estimate how much their territory might produce overall  [0m
[33m given the number of customers,  [0m
[33m how loyal those customers are,  [0m
[33m and how strong the competition is.  [0m
[33m You take all the territory forecast  [0m
[33m roll them up to a company level sales potential.  [0m
[33m Now, to learn how to do both of these approaches,  [0m
[33m see my course, Sales Forecasting, here on LinkedIn Learning.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Creating sales territories[0m

[33m - To create sales territories, I recommend two approaches.  [0m
[33m The buildup method or the breakdown method.  [0m
[33m It's a little bit like the forecasting methods  [0m
[33m of top down and bottom up.  [0m
[33m With the buildup method,  [0m
[33m you start at the level of the individual rep  [0m
[33m to understand their workload capacity  [0m
[33m and how frequently they need to call on customers  [0m
[33m to succeed.  [0m
[33m Here are the steps.  [0m
[33m You start with the sales task.  [0m
[33m What kinds of customers are we calling on,  [0m
[33m and how many of them are there in our area?  [0m
[33m What products or services are we selling?  [0m
[33m And given that, what does a rep need to do with customers  [0m
[33m to generate a sale, and how long does that take?  [0m
[33m Let's go back to our medical device example from before.  [0m
[33m We're selling diagnostic machines to hospitals,  [0m
[33m clinics, and doctor's offices.  [0m
[33m And there are about [0m[1;33m1000[0m[33m of them in our area.  [0m
[33m Well, given the complexity of selling this equipment,  [0m
[33m reps need to spend a lot of time during each sales call.  [0m
[33m Given how spread out customers are,  [0m
[33m our reps can call on about two per day,  [0m
[33m or about [0m[1;33m500[0m[33m calls per year.  [0m
[33m We did the same calculations  [0m
[33m when deciding on how many reps to hire.  [0m
[33m Now, we need to draw a geographical boundary for each rep,  [0m
[33m so that each of them have about [0m[1;33m100[0m[33m of these customers.  [0m
[33m The breakdown method is the opposite.  [0m
[33m Look at your forecast for overall company sales potential,  [0m
[33m then divide that by the number of reps you have.  [0m
[33m That's what's expected of each rep.  [0m
[33m And then, you create geographical territories  [0m
[33m with this level of sales volume.  [0m
[33m Now, here are some tips when creating sales territories.  [0m
[33m First, try to use geographical boundaries  [0m
[33m that already exist.  [0m
[33m You can create sales territories  [0m
[33m around existing state boundaries.  [0m
[33m For example, you might create a territory  [0m
[33m that includes all the states in New England.  [0m
[33m You can also use county, city, or even zip code boundaries.  [0m
[33m This makes it perfectly clear  [0m
[33m where a rep is supposed to sell,  [0m
[33m and where they are not supposed to sell,  [0m
[33m and where they might interfere with another rep.  [0m
[33m Now, not every territory will be the same size and shape.  [0m
[33m Rather, you're trying to create equal territories  [0m
[33m in terms of sales potential, not physical size.  [0m
[33m Be sure your financial and IT systems are set up  [0m
[33m so they capture sales based on customers  [0m
[33m in these geographical boundaries.  [0m
[33m You need to measure results at the territory level  [0m
[33m to assess progress.  [0m
[33m And finally, be prepared  [0m
[33m to change territory boundaries often.  [0m
[33m Hey, market conditions change, your reps change,  [0m
[33m and competition changes.  [0m
[33m Expanding or contracting the size of a territory  [0m
[33m is another dowel that you as a sales manager have  [0m
[33m to get results.  [0m
[33m Well designed sales territories  [0m
[33m can make your customers happier,  [0m
[33m reduce selling and travel costs,  [0m
[33m and keep your reps motivated and productive.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Setting sales quotas[0m

[33m - A sales quota is a target amount  [0m
[33m that reps are expected to sell.  [0m
[33m Quotas are an important sales management tool.  [0m
[33m Setting quotas links the sales rep directly  [0m
[33m to the firm's strategy and to the sales task.  [0m
[33m They help focus resources on high potential areas.  [0m
[33m But most importantly, quotas motivate.  [0m
[33m Let's look at how you do it.  [0m
[33m Step one is to collect data.  [0m
[33m Look at each territory's potential market sales  [0m
[33m versus the rep's sales history.  [0m
[33m Be sure to gather data for a time period  [0m
[33m that is comparable to the quota setting period.  [0m
[33m One year, for example.  [0m
[33m You need to assess whether the rep is at, above  [0m
[33m or below the potential of the territory.  [0m
[33m Are they selling what you would expect given that potential?  [0m
[33m The next step is to understand territory differences.  [0m
[33m Not all territories are created equally.  [0m
[33m And when you design the territories,  [0m
[33m you should have noted things  [0m
[33m like different economic conditions,  [0m
[33m the competitive situation, and travel times  [0m
[33m within the territory.  [0m
[33m Now, with this information,  [0m
[33m it's time to set a quota for each rep,  [0m
[33m but adjusted upward or downward based on current penetration  [0m
[33m and individual rep ability.  [0m
[33m For example, in low penetrated areas,  [0m
[33m you might ask the rep to get more growth next year,  [0m
[33m but if your company already has high penetration,  [0m
[33m meaning a high market share,  [0m
[33m it would be appropriate to keep the quota flat for that rep.  [0m
[33m After all, there's just not enough new business for the rep  [0m
[33m to capture if you already have most of it.  [0m
[33m Now, not every rep will have the same quota  [0m
[33m or the same level of difficulty achieving the quota,  [0m
[33m so your most talented performing reps should be expected  [0m
[33m to produce more.  [0m
[33m Reps in shrinking territories will be expected  [0m
[33m to produce less.  [0m
[33m Setting quotas is a bit of an art backed by good data  [0m
[33m and even better judgment.  [0m
[33m That's why it's critical to do a reality check here.  [0m
[33m Does the quota seem fair and reasonable?  [0m
[33m Will it motivate the rep  [0m
[33m or is there a chance it might backfire and cause the rep  [0m
[33m to just give up because it's set too high?  [0m
[33m And finally, you need to communicate the quota to the rep,  [0m
[33m make quotas clear  [0m
[33m and thoroughly explain how the quotas were determined.  [0m
[33m Also be sure to announce the quotas  [0m
[33m prior to the effective time period.  [0m
[33m Quotas are so important because they send a key signal  [0m
[33m to your rep.  [0m
[33m And that signal is how much confidence you have  [0m
[33m in their ability to succeed.  [0m
[33m Quotas are like a contract between the sales manager  [0m
[33m and the rep.  [0m
[33m So set them carefully to support your team  [0m
[33m and see the results you're looking for.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m4[0m[33m. Managing Sales Teams[0m

[33m### Understanding sales compensation[0m

[33m - To create and manage an effective sales force,  [0m
[33m you must compensate your reps.  [0m
[33m The good news is that sales managers have a variety  [0m
[33m of sales compensation schemes to use.  [0m
[33m The key is to select one that is market-competitive  [0m
[33m and that drives the right behaviors in your sales reps.  [0m
[33m Compensation can affect  [0m
[33m the number of sales calls a rep makes,  [0m
[33m the quality of that sales call,  [0m
[33m and how much time a rep devotes to the job.  [0m
[33m It all depends, once again, on the sales task.  [0m
[33m Who do we call on?  [0m
[33m What products do we sell?  [0m
[33m What activities lead to success?  [0m
[33m And what interactions do reps have  [0m
[33m with others in the company?  [0m
[33m In other words, compensation can drive behavior  [0m
[33m in all four areas of the sales task.  [0m
[33m Now, creating a sales comp program takes a lot of work,  [0m
[33m so it's important to get help from others  [0m
[33m within your company.  [0m
[33m such as your finance and human resource departments.  [0m
[33m A good sales comp program is simple, fair,  [0m
[33m flexible, affordable, and, most of all, competitive.  [0m
[33m To design a sales compensation plan,  [0m
[33m start by looking at your current comp program  [0m
[33m and determine how well it's working.  [0m
[33m What are its strengths and weaknesses?  [0m
[33m Is the comp plan aligned  [0m
[33m with the strategic direction of the firm?  [0m
[33m Is the plan affordable  [0m
[33m within your overall company's business model?  [0m
[33m Is it competitive with other firms that you compete with?  [0m
[33m Is the program too volatile  [0m
[33m in terms of how reps make their money?  [0m
[33m Be sure to get diverse input when you do this assessment.  [0m
[33m You should get feedback from your senior management,  [0m
[33m your sales teams, and sales support groups,  [0m
[33m but also include feedback  [0m
[33m from marketing and other departments,  [0m
[33m especially ones that are directly impacted  [0m
[33m by the activities of sales reps,  [0m
[33m such as your manufacturing team or customer service groups.  [0m
[33m You should also assess how simple and easy it is  [0m
[33m to administer the current plan.  [0m
[33m Are there ways to streamline it  [0m
[33m and make it an even more efficient part  [0m
[33m of your overall sales management toolkit?  [0m
[33m What can you do to make it more flexible and nimble?  [0m
[33m A great sales compensation plan  [0m
[33m links all aspects of sales management.  [0m
[33m The best sales managers are the ones that take the time  [0m
[33m to design the right one for their company.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Designing sales compensation programs[0m

[33m - To design a sales compensation program,  [0m
[33m follow these four steps.  [0m
[33m First, determine how much you want each rep to earn.  [0m
[33m Second, determine the method you will use  [0m
[33m to compensate them.  [0m
[33m Third, set thresholds around the target compensation,  [0m
[33m and finally, test your program before you put it into place.  [0m
[33m So first let's discuss how to determine  [0m
[33m the total amount of money you want your sales reps  [0m
[33m to earn annually.  [0m
[33m Take a look at their past performance  [0m
[33m and decide if you want to make adjustments  [0m
[33m up or down to that total for the coming year.  [0m
[33m For example, you might add in a cost of living adjustment.  [0m
[33m Make sure the amount you pay is competitive  [0m
[33m with the rest of the industry.  [0m
[33m Next, determine the method you want to use to pay your reps.  [0m
[33m You could use a straight salary program,  [0m
[33m a variable commission program, or a combination of the two.  [0m
[33m Straight salary programs are simple,  [0m
[33m easy to administer and control  [0m
[33m and easy to tie to the sales task,  [0m
[33m but there's no incentive to work beyond what is expected.  [0m
[33m Variable commission plans are great  [0m
[33m because they're directly linked to the sales generated.  [0m
[33m The more you sell, the more you earn,  [0m
[33m but that creates a lot of risk for the sales employee.  [0m
[33m Their income can be erratic and that makes it tough  [0m
[33m to pay the bills each month,  [0m
[33m so most companies use a combination.  [0m
[33m A combination program works by giving a rep a base salary  [0m
[33m of say [0m[1;33m75[0m[33m% of their projected target earnings.  [0m
[33m And then they have to earn the remaining portion  [0m
[33m of their salary from commissions.  [0m
[33m They may earn less, the same as,  [0m
[33m or well above the targeted salary.  [0m
[33m It's all up to how hard they want to work.  [0m
[33m Combination programs give you the best of both worlds,  [0m
[33m the security and stability of having a base salary  [0m
[33m plus a strong incentive to achieve more  [0m
[33m and accomplish the sales task.  [0m
[33m The next step is to set thresholds on how the rep  [0m
[33m earns the variable portion of their income.  [0m
[33m You could pay a straight dollar amount  [0m
[33m or a percentage of sales on each unit sold,  [0m
[33m or you could vary the payments  [0m
[33m based on reaching certain quotas.  [0m
[33m Here's an example.  [0m
[33m Let's imagine a medical device rep gets paid $[0m[1;33m3[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m  [0m
[33m on each diagnostic machine sold for the first [0m[1;33m10[0m[33m units,  [0m
[33m but then that amount increases to $[0m[1;33m5[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m  [0m
[33m when she sells units [0m[1;33m11[0m[33m to [0m[1;33m20[0m[33m.  [0m
[33m Boy, that gives her a lot more incentive  [0m
[33m to sell that first [0m[1;33m10[0m[33m units.  [0m
[33m Finally, you need to test your comp program  [0m
[33m before you implement it.  [0m
[33m Here's a tip, take your new program  [0m
[33m and run it through last year's actual sales results  [0m
[33m to see how each rep would have been paid  [0m
[33m under the new program, and then ask yourself,  [0m
[33m will each rep earn what you want them to?  [0m
[33m Will the new program drive the desired behaviors?  [0m
[33m Is there enough upside and downside for the rep  [0m
[33m to really motivate them?  [0m
[33m And did you get the right split between fixed salary  [0m
[33m and variable commission?  [0m
[33m Most importantly, is the new program simple  [0m
[33m and easy to understand?  [0m
[33m A well-designed sales compensation program  [0m
[33m links all the elements of sales management,  [0m
[33m the sales task, the structure of your territories and quotas  [0m
[33m and how you motivate a competent sales team.  [0m
[33m Now that's a recipe for success.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Communicating sales compensation[0m

[33m - The best compensation plan can fail  [0m
[33m if not properly communicated.  [0m
[33m It's essential that your sales employees  [0m
[33m know exactly how and when they will be paid.  [0m
[33m To make sure you get it right,  [0m
[33m I recommend creating a formal written document  [0m
[33m that describes how the plan works,  [0m
[33m how it compares to industry market rates,  [0m
[33m and the method and timing of how reps earn their money.  [0m
[33m Be sure to include examples.  [0m
[33m Reps will share this information with their partner.  [0m
[33m So it's essential the family fully understands  [0m
[33m [0m[1;33m([0m[33mlaughing[0m[1;33m)[0m[33m  [0m
[33m how the income is coming in.  [0m
[33m By the way,  [0m
[33m make sure you coordinate that written document  [0m
[33m with your finance and human resources departments  [0m
[33m to make sure the pay plan is in the budget  [0m
[33m and that it complies with HR policies.  [0m
[33m Along with a written pay plan,  [0m
[33m I also recommend doing verbal presentations.  [0m
[33m Start by announcing the pay plan to the entire sales force,  [0m
[33m and then follow up with one-on-one meetings  [0m
[33m between the manager and the rep.  [0m
[33m You may have to deal with special situations,  [0m
[33m such as when a rep's compensation is likely to drop  [0m
[33m under the new plan.  [0m
[33m They need to know why.  [0m
[33m Individual meetings help you reinforce the message  [0m
[33m of what you expect, and how the comp plan is tied  [0m
[33m to the sales task and their quotas for the year.  [0m
[33m Now, after you communicate it,  [0m
[33m it's time to put the plan in place.  [0m
[33m The best compensation plan can also fail  [0m
[33m if not properly administered.  [0m
[33m Here are some key success factors.  [0m
[33m Be sure to give continuous feedback to each rep  [0m
[33m on how they're earning under the new plan,  [0m
[33m include clear documentation on the calculations used  [0m
[33m to figure out their earnings.  [0m
[33m It's critical that you pay reps with strict adherence  [0m
[33m to the defined pay schedules,  [0m
[33m and that you resolve any mistakes or issues in compensation.  [0m
[33m A rep's motivation will drop  [0m
[33m if they aren't paid the right amount and on time.  [0m
[33m Now be sure to measure how the compensation plan is working.  [0m
[33m What were the objectives?  [0m
[33m What metrics tell you if these objectives are being met?  [0m
[33m Is it sales, profits, or market share?  [0m
[33m And what are the actual results of those metrics  [0m
[33m versus the plan?  [0m
[33m Finally is the plan as simple as expected?  [0m
[33m It's essential that you measure continuously.  [0m
[33m Hey, just waiting until the end of the year,  [0m
[33m only to find out that the plan wasn't quite working  [0m
[33m is unacceptable.  [0m
[33m Great sales managers are proactive in everything they do,  [0m
[33m especially in keeping track of how their reps  [0m
[33m are getting paid.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Managing underperforming reps[0m

[33m - All sales managers will face the situation  [0m
[33m where a rep is just not performing.  [0m
[33m Even with the best compensation and reward system in place,  [0m
[33m a few of your reps won't get the job done.  [0m
[33m So here are the steps to dealing  [0m
[33m with underperforming sales employees.  [0m
[33m First, look at the data  [0m
[33m about your team's overall performance.  [0m
[33m Look at sales call reports and sales results.  [0m
[33m Are the reps going to the right accounts  [0m
[33m and doing the right things in those accounts?  [0m
[33m Are you getting complaints from customers or other people  [0m
[33m that suggest there may be a problem?  [0m
[33m Then you need to diagnose why a particular rep  [0m
[33m is underperforming.  [0m
[33m In my experience, there are only two reasons for it.  [0m
[33m They don't know how to perform the sales task,  [0m
[33m or they don't want to.  [0m
[33m They lack the skill or the will.  [0m
[33m Let's look at each one.  [0m
[33m If a rep doesn't know how to do the job,  [0m
[33m it might be due to a lack of training.  [0m
[33m So in this case, go back to your sales competency model  [0m
[33m that outlines the skills, knowledge,  [0m
[33m and behaviors needed to succeed in this job.  [0m
[33m Go through each one and assess where that rep is lacking.  [0m
[33m Then work with your training department or your HR group  [0m
[33m to create a customized remedial training program  [0m
[33m to get that rep back up to speed.  [0m
[33m Now here's a tip.  [0m
[33m Be sure that the rep is fully on board with the assessment  [0m
[33m of where they need help, and that they're fully committed  [0m
[33m to closing the gap.  [0m
[33m Hey, if not, you'll continue to see weak performance  [0m
[33m out of that rep down the road.  [0m
[33m Another simple reason for a poor performance  [0m
[33m is that the sales task has changed  [0m
[33m and the rep didn't hear about it.  [0m
[33m So in that case, sit down with the rep,  [0m
[33m go through the sales task in detail,  [0m
[33m and perhaps schedule a sales call with the rep  [0m
[33m so you can see how they're performing it firsthand.  [0m
[33m Now, a harder situation to deal with  [0m
[33m is when a rep knows the job, but is still not performing.  [0m
[33m They're just not working hard enough to get the job done.  [0m
[33m Here again, there could be a lot of reasons for that.  [0m
[33m It might be a pay issue.  [0m
[33m Or perhaps they're just not motivated day to day  [0m
[33m to do the work.  [0m
[33m Or maybe they have a personal problem at home.  [0m
[33m So as their manager, you need to help them  [0m
[33m turn the situation around.  [0m
[33m But be sure to set limits and deadlines  [0m
[33m on when you and the rep will agree  [0m
[33m that the issue is resolved  [0m
[33m and that performance will improve.  [0m
[33m If those deadlines aren't met,  [0m
[33m you'll need to find a new rep for that territory.  [0m
[33m Managing salespeople is a rewarding  [0m
[33m but sometimes challenging leadership role,  [0m
[33m especially when you consider that every rep is different,  [0m
[33m each has their own skill levels,  [0m
[33m and each has their own ambitions and career direction.  [0m
[33m That's why skilled managers don't manage the team  [0m
[33m as a group, rather they manage it one person at a time.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Measuring sales performance[0m

[33m - Sales managers hold their team members accountable  [0m
[33m for achieving results given the sales task.  [0m
[33m But to do that, you first have to measure results.  [0m
[33m Here's how, first, be sure to measure  [0m
[33m both the outputs of your sales rep, as well as the inputs.  [0m
[33m The outputs include things like their sales revenue,  [0m
[33m number of units sold, gross margin,  [0m
[33m and number of new accounts.  [0m
[33m Inputs are the rep's activities  [0m
[33m that go into achieving the sales task.  [0m
[33m These include things like the number of calls  [0m
[33m they make each day, the number of days worked,  [0m
[33m the actual selling time per call,  [0m
[33m as well as things like the number of phone calls made  [0m
[33m to prospective clients.  [0m
[33m Inputs are what the reps do to generate outputs.  [0m
[33m But the most effective way to measure it  [0m
[33m is to look at the ratios of the inputs and the outputs.  [0m
[33m Here's an example.  [0m
[33m Imagine you're evaluating two sales reps.  [0m
[33m One of them has made [0m[1;33m100[0m[33m sales calls this month  [0m
[33m and the other has made only [0m[1;33m90[0m[33m.  [0m
[33m So which rep is doing the better job?  [0m
[33m Well, if you look at just the total calls,  [0m
[33m it would appear the first rep is working harder.  [0m
[33m But when you consider the number of days worked,  [0m
[33m the picture changes.  [0m
[33m You should compare the ratio of sales calls worked  [0m
[33m divided by the number of days worked.  [0m
[33m Look at this example.  [0m
[33m Rep A makes [0m[1;33m100[0m[33m calls in [0m[1;33m20[0m[33m days,  [0m
[33m which equals five calls per day.  [0m
[33m But Rep B does [0m[1;33m90[0m[33m calls in only [0m[1;33m15[0m[33m days,  [0m
[33m so that equals six calls per day.  [0m
[33m Now, viewed this way, Rep B is working harder.  [0m
[33m Now here's a tip.  [0m
[33m Look at your sales task and create a ratio of outputs  [0m
[33m divided by inputs for each activity.  [0m
[33m Look at this example of how these ratios can be used  [0m
[33m to create a sales effectiveness index.  [0m
[33m Sales effectiveness index equals the calls  [0m
[33m divided by days worked times orders divided by calls  [0m
[33m times sales divided by orders.  [0m
[33m When you evaluate your reps using this index,  [0m
[33m you're going to see exactly who's getting the most output  [0m
[33m for the amount of input they make to the job.  [0m
[33m Now, don't just measure something  [0m
[33m because you happen to have the data.  [0m
[33m Your reps might feel you're micro-managing  [0m
[33m if you measure an activity,  [0m
[33m but don't expect them to do anything differently  [0m
[33m because of it.  [0m
[33m Measure the things that matter.  [0m
[33m Also, be sure to measure continuously.  [0m
[33m Don't wait until the end of the year  [0m
[33m to find out something is wrong.  [0m
[33m Do it as often as you can to take corrective action.  [0m
[33m Also, make sure reps know how they're being evaluated.  [0m
[33m Hey, don't surprise them with something you're measuring  [0m
[33m and they're not even aware of it.  [0m
[33m You'll lose their trust.  [0m
[33m Finally, be sure to set standards of performance.  [0m
[33m Don't measure something and tell them  [0m
[33m they've done a good job or a bad job  [0m
[33m if there were no criteria to assess them.  [0m
[33m The best sales managers know  [0m
[33m that it's really all about the conversations you have  [0m
[33m with the reps that matter most.  [0m
[33m Measurements of performance are just an indicator.  [0m
[33m When you combine thoughtful conversation  [0m
[33m with good, accurate data about their work,  [0m
[33m it shows the rep that you care about helping them succeed.  [0m
[33m And that's the most rewarding part  [0m
[33m of the sales manager's job.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m## [0m[1;33m5[0m[33m. Managing Sales Virtually[0m

[33m### Creating the virtual sales task[0m

[33m - Sales managers must be adaptive and flexible  [0m
[33m to changes in the marketplace.  [0m
[33m And given today's new work environment,  [0m
[33m this is more true than ever.  [0m
[33m As with everything else in sales management,  [0m
[33m it starts with the sales task,  [0m
[33m which is your playbook for success.  [0m
[33m Let's look at how to take your current sales task  [0m
[33m and update it to include more components that are virtual.  [0m
[33m There are four questions you answer  [0m
[33m to define the sales task.  [0m
[33m First, which customers are we going after?  [0m
[33m Now, in a virtual world,  [0m
[33m you and your marketing colleagues may want to revise  [0m
[33m how you think about the customers you go after.  [0m
[33m Virtual sales calls may give you more access  [0m
[33m to different types of customers, for example.  [0m
[33m Next, you decide what products  [0m
[33m and services you want the team to sell.  [0m
[33m Now, this probably won't change too much,  [0m
[33m but you may find that you're able to provide a new level  [0m
[33m of sales support using virtual technologies.  [0m
[33m And if so, you should include that  [0m
[33m as part of your sales task.  [0m
[33m The third part of the sales task  [0m
[33m defines exactly what activities must be accomplished  [0m
[33m to sell a product to a customer.  [0m
[33m How many calls do you want your sales reps to make  [0m
[33m to each customer?  [0m
[33m And what do you want them to do  [0m
[33m when they meet with a customer?  [0m
[33m This is the part that really matters,  [0m
[33m and you should take your time thinking this through.  [0m
[33m Selling virtually may also help the reps be more efficient  [0m
[33m because they don't have to drive to a customer location.  [0m
[33m The sales task should be changed  [0m
[33m to reflect how many virtual calls you want reps to make.  [0m
[33m But also ask, what can and cannot be accomplished  [0m
[33m in a virtual sales environment  [0m
[33m versus the traditional in-person environment?  [0m
[33m You may find, for example,  [0m
[33m that some parts of the selling process  [0m
[33m could be done virtually  [0m
[33m while others must be done in person.  [0m
[33m For example, if a salesperson does product demonstrations  [0m
[33m on a customer job site,  [0m
[33m that might be impossible to do well on a Zoom call.  [0m
[33m So in this case, the sales task should reflect  [0m
[33m this new blended approach to selling.  [0m
[33m And finally, what departments  [0m
[33m within the company do you want your reps to call  [0m
[33m when they need support?  [0m
[33m Now, with virtual communications, reps may be tempted  [0m
[33m to reach people they might not have called on before.  [0m
[33m So you need to put in strict guidance in the sales task  [0m
[33m about who they can contact for support.  [0m
[33m The key is not to let your reps take precious selling time  [0m
[33m and use it for calls to headquarters.  [0m
[33m I mean, networking is fine,  [0m
[33m but make sure they use good judgment.  [0m
[33m Who do we target? What do we sell?  [0m
[33m How do we sell it?  [0m
[33m And where do we go for support?  [0m
[33m With the new world of work and virtual technologies,  [0m
[33m you have more opportunities than ever  [0m
[33m to create an effective sales task.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Conducting virtual competency programs[0m

[33m - If you include any virtual components in your sales task,  [0m
[33m you'll need to make sure your reps are highly skilled  [0m
[33m at using virtual technologies.  [0m
[33m Now, you might be thinking, "Hey, what's the big deal?  [0m
[33m Everyone knows how to use Zoom or Teams.  [0m
[33m Just turn on your webcam and go, right?"  [0m
[33m Well, not so fast.  [0m
[33m In the professional world of sales,  [0m
[33m this approach won't cut it.  [0m
[33m Here's why, if you set high standards for your sales reps  [0m
[33m when they meet the clients in person,  [0m
[33m you will want to set the same or even higher standards  [0m
[33m for when they meet clients virtually.  [0m
[33m Here's what that looks like.  [0m
[33m First is appearance.  [0m
[33m If reps wear a suit and tie to a client location,  [0m
[33m I believe you want them looking the same onscreen.  [0m
[33m That level of dress brings a sense of credibility  [0m
[33m and expertise, and the rep will lose this  [0m
[33m if he or she just wears the casual home clothes.  [0m
[33m Next is technology.  [0m
[33m Make sure your reps have good quality web cameras,  [0m
[33m microphones, and internet speed.  [0m
[33m Teach them how to look and sound  [0m
[33m as professional as possible.  [0m
[33m Make sure they use appropriate lighting  [0m
[33m so they look natural.  [0m
[33m That means no open windows directly behind them,  [0m
[33m or they'll get too much glare on the screen, not good.  [0m
[33m Give reps a checklist of what to do  [0m
[33m to create their virtual selling studio.  [0m
[33m They need a quiet location with good acoustics.  [0m
[33m They need to elevate their laptop or webcam  [0m
[33m so that it's an eye level.  [0m
[33m They want to be looking straight into the eyes of the client  [0m
[33m as much as possible.  [0m
[33m Be sure reps know how to use a proper background  [0m
[33m on their screens that has the company logo.  [0m
[33m No, not a scene from their recent vacation.  [0m
[33m Reps should learn proper etiquette on Zoom calls,  [0m
[33m meaning no eating, no multitasking,  [0m
[33m and no pets or kids running around the room.  [0m
[33m Finally, reps need to practice good sales call planning  [0m
[33m for a virtual call just as they would for an in-person call.  [0m
[33m Be prepared to show documents using screen-sharing,  [0m
[33m manage time effectively, and do the activities  [0m
[33m that are called for in the sales task.  [0m
[33m Virtual sales calling is both an opportunity and a risk.  [0m
[33m Good sales managers don't leave it to chance  [0m
[33m that reps will just figure it out.  [0m
[33m Instead, give them proper training  [0m
[33m and motivation to do an outstanding job.  [0m
[33m [0m


[33m### Creating virtual territories[0m

[33m - Territories define the scope and domain  [0m
[33m where each sales rep can sell.  [0m
[33m Now typically, territories are based  [0m
[33m around a geographical definition,  [0m
[33m but with the new world at work  [0m
[33m and so much of what we do being virtual,  [0m
[33m those territory boundaries can be anywhere.  [0m
[33m There are lots of possibilities and lots of benefits.  [0m
[33m To create virtual territories,  [0m
[33m you start the same way as creating a geographical territory.  [0m
[33m First, look at your virtual sales task  [0m
[33m and understand how many virtual sales call a rep can make  [0m
[33m in a day.  [0m
[33m Wow, that will be a huge change given that you're taking  [0m
[33m out the driving time between customer locations.  [0m
[33m Reps can make more virtual calls per day than in-person.  [0m
[33m Let's use our medical device example from before.  [0m
[33m We're selling diagnostic machines to hospitals, clinics  [0m
[33m and doctor's offices.  [0m
[33m And let's say there are about a thousand  [0m
[33m of these customers across the country.  [0m
[33m And they need to be called on five times a year.  [0m
[33m Well, that means your sales team needs  [0m
[33m to do [0m[1;33m5[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m calls.  [0m
[33m With in person sales calls,  [0m
[33m your reps can make two calls per day,  [0m
[33m but virtually they can now make four calls per day.  [0m
[33m That's a whopping [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m calls per year per rep,  [0m
[33m instead of only [0m[1;33m500[0m[33m calls in person.  [0m
[33m That means you need only five reps instead of [0m[1;33m10[0m[33m  [0m
[33m from the previous example.  [0m
[33m But here's the cool part.  [0m
[33m Each rep now has [0m[1;33m200[0m[33m accounts  [0m
[33m and those accounts can be located anywhere in the world.  [0m
[33m Geographical boundaries are out the window.  [0m
[33m Now that sounds great,  [0m
[33m but here are some important things to consider  [0m
[33m before you jump right in to virtual territories.  [0m
[33m First, I recommend you take it slowly  [0m
[33m and phase in a more virtual approach rather  [0m
[33m than all at once.  [0m
[33m That gives customers and your reps time to adjust  [0m
[33m to this new sales pattern.  [0m
[33m You don't want anyone upset  [0m
[33m with the lack of in-person contact.  [0m
[33m In fact,  [0m
[33m you may want to use a hybrid approach  [0m
[33m where the rep still visits the customer every month,  [0m
[33m or perhaps every quarter.  [0m
[33m Second, don't get too carried away with virtual territories  [0m
[33m that are spread all over the country.  [0m
[33m I suggest you keep reps calling customers  [0m
[33m in the same time zone, for example.  [0m
[33m It may be helpful to keep reps calling virtually,  [0m
[33m but in the same general geographic region.  [0m
[33m That way, they learn about the customers,  [0m
[33m who they compete with and so on.  [0m
[33m And customers will appreciate  [0m
[33m when the rep is still a hometown supplier  [0m
[33m who understands their regional culture.  [0m
[33m Next, be sure to carefully measure results,  [0m
[33m especially customer satisfaction.  [0m
[33m You want reps to achieve the sales task,  [0m
[33m but not at the expense of angry customers.  [0m
[33m Hey, as a manager,  [0m
[33m be sure to join reps  [0m
[33m on their virtual sales calls periodically,  [0m
[33m to track how things are going.  [0m
[33m A virtual ride along can be just as effective  [0m
[33m as the in-person one.  [0m
[33m And finally, make sure you involve the right people  [0m
[33m inside your company to make this new virtual approach work.  [0m
[33m For example, your IT department may need  [0m
[33m to completely redesign sales reporting  [0m
[33m because they can't use customer zip codes anymore.  [0m
[33m Your supply chain team may have to adapt  [0m
[33m how they ship products,  [0m
[33m given the different selling patterns.  [0m
[33m Virtual sales territories have lots of benefits,  [0m
[33m but as with other aspects of sales management,  [0m
[33m it'll take good leadership and collaboration  [0m
[33m on your part to make it happen.  [0m

[33m## Conclusion[0m

[33m### Continuing your sales management journey[0m

[33m - Sales managers are highly sought after  [0m
[33m because of their ability to manage one  [0m
[33m of the company's most important assets,  [0m
[33m it's sales force.  [0m
[33m The most effective sales managers  [0m
[33m generate the most effective sales results.  [0m
[33m For many companies, the first line sales manager  [0m
[33m is the most important job in the company.  [0m
[33m So here are some guidelines  [0m
[33m on how to continue developing your career  [0m
[33m in sales management.  [0m
[33m When I give career advice,  [0m
[33m I remind people to never let a year go by  [0m
[33m without developing some part of your professional skillset.  [0m
[33m First, look for opportunities to broaden your skills  [0m
[33m and experience.  [0m
[33m I believe the first move you should make  [0m
[33m outside of sales management is a position in marketing  [0m
[33m as either a product manager, market development manager,  [0m
[33m or perhaps a role in new product development.  [0m
[33m You need to learn how a company develops strategy,  [0m
[33m how it identifies new opportunities  [0m
[33m and how it brings together resources  [0m
[33m to go after those opportunities.  [0m
[33m Hey, never forget with your experience as a sales manager,  [0m
[33m you bring tremendous value to these marketing roles,  [0m
[33m but you also need to see this as an opportunity  [0m
[33m to get schooled on marketing concepts.  [0m
[33m So take advantage of it.  [0m
[33m Also be opportunistic when considering other roles  [0m
[33m outside of marketing.  [0m
[33m For example, you should consider a position overseas  [0m
[33m to build your global and cultural acumen,  [0m
[33m or perhaps you might want to take a temporary position  [0m
[33m on a special project team,  [0m
[33m perhaps related to a company merger.  [0m
[33m These all help develop your business experience.  [0m
[33m Always think of yourself as a lifelong learner.  [0m
[33m Stay on top of new technology,  [0m
[33m read about what other companies are doing.  [0m
[33m Look for best practices and other industries  [0m
[33m that might help you improve how you approach  [0m
[33m managing a sales team.  [0m
[33m If you consider yourself a sales professional,  [0m
[33m then I advise you to join the community of practice.  [0m
[33m Get out there and engage in organizations  [0m
[33m like the Sales Management Association,  [0m
[33m attend one of the many sales management conferences  [0m
[33m held each year and join sales related groups on LinkedIn.  [0m
[33m Attend networking events  [0m
[33m and get to know other sales management professionals.  [0m
[33m All learning is a process of taking an action,  [0m
[33m reflecting on what happened, learning from it,  [0m
[33m and then improving.  [0m
[33m You want to learn at a rate faster than the rate of change.  [0m
[33m That means you need to experiment,  [0m
[33m practice new sales management techniques  [0m
[33m while perfecting the old ones.  [0m
[33m And finally keep a strong ethical base  [0m
[33m when managing sales teams.  [0m
[33m So much is at stake when you consider the lives  [0m
[33m and careers of the sales professionals working for you.  [0m
[33m You have to constantly balance the needs of the business  [0m
[33m with the needs of the individual.  [0m
[33m Always communicate honestly, build trust  [0m
[33m and don't cut corners just to make sales numbers.  [0m
[33m Great sales managers earn respect  [0m
[33m from the people below them, above them,  [0m
[33m and from their peers based on their ethical approach  [0m
[33m to the job, not on how many awards they've won.  [0m
[33m Congratulations on completing the course.  [0m
[33m Now I want you to go out there  [0m
[33m and build and manage great sales teams.  [0m
[33m [0m

[33m## Product Management First Steps[0m
[33mBehind every successful technology product lies the guiding hand of the product manager. Product managers are critical leaders who coordinate all aspects of product development, from making the business case to [0m
[33mdeciding when and if a product should be retired. In this course, principal staff instructor and former Adobe Principal Product Manager Doug Winnie provides a comprehensive overview of product management and takes [0m
[33myou through the six stages of the product life cycle [0m[1;33m([0m[33mPLC[0m[1;33m)[0m[33m: research, plan, build, release, refine, and retire. He also explains the day-to-day activities of a product manager, introduces you to the members of the [0m
[33mproduct team, walks through interactive ways to help define your product, and outlines the skills a product manager needs to have to be successful. Whether you want to become a product manager or simply become a [0m
[33mbetter member of a product team, this course will help you understand how a good process brings better products to life.[0m
[33m## Technical Product Management[0m
[33mAre you interested in exploring a career as a Product Manager in a tech organization, but are concerned you may lack the technical background required? If youâ€™re passionate about technology, are always thinking [0m
[33mabout new product ideas and enjoy solving problems, then the role of a technical product manager might be just right for you! Thereâ€™s no straightforward path that leads to a career in technical product management [0m
[33mand indeed the role needs a fluid skill set that requires you to wear different hats throughout the product development lifecycleâ€”from idea generation, to coming up with creative solutions, to the implementation [0m
[33mstage, and final rollout. In this course, Dr. Marily Nika covers what the role of a technical product manager entails and describes some of the key concepts, skills, mindsets, and frameworks that will make you a [0m
[33mgreat fit for this role, with or without a technical background.[0m
[33m## Product Management: Building a Product Strategy[0m
[33mBehind every successful product there is a clear strategic vision that takes both market and customer needs into account. Essentially, strategy is the set of choices a company makes in order to achieve its [0m
[33mobjectives. These choices include which products to develop, which market segments to focus on, how to differentiate, how to price, how to position, and more. Product leaders are the guardians of a company's [0m
[33mstrategy. While many people and teams can contribute to developing a strategy, product leaders need to articulate it and ensure that it's done in a way that is applicable for day-to-day decision-making. This course [0m
[33mlays out how to develop an effective product strategy. Instructors Eldad Persky and Teg Grenager walk through a step-by-step process for creating a smart, thoughtful strategy, and explain how to build support for [0m
[33mit. Plus, they go over how to maintain and implement your strategy.[0m
[33m## Product Management: Building a Product Roadmap[0m
[33mA roadmap is a simple but powerful tool for product development. A strong product roadmap supports your business objectives and product strategy. It can help you make decisions and answer critical questions. For [0m
[33mexample, how do you decide which projects to pursue, and which to defer until later? How can you know which projects will be important a few months from now, when the market is changing so quickly? And how do you [0m
[33mget all the diverse groups in your organization aligned behind one particular plan?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This course shows how to build a product roadmap for your businessâ€”and gain critical stakeholder buy-in. See [0m
[33mexamples of what roadmaps might look like, and spend time learning the tools and techniques necessary to map the projects for your specific organization. Instructors Teg Grenager and Eldad Persky show you how to [0m
[33mcreate strong, dynamic roadmaps that can help ensure that your team is working on the right projects at the right time.[0m
[33m## Product Management: Customer Development[0m
[33mGreat products are built from a strong understanding of customer needs. As a product manager, you're tasked with identifying those customer needs so that you're able to direct the creation of products that make your[0m
[33mcustomers' lives a bit easier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this course, discover how to leverage the customer development process to validate your assumptions and create products customers will truly loveâ€”without [0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mYujian[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Before you know it,[0m
[33mevery developer will be working[0m
[33mwith some sort of AI product.[0m
[33mGet ahead of the curve by understanding not just how to work[0m
[33mwith an AI product,[0m
[33mbut understanding how to build AI products.[0m
[33mI've built hundreds of RAG applications[0m
[33mand I'm distilling what I've learned about[0m
[33moptimizing RAG apps[0m
[33mand passing that knowledge onto you.[0m
[33mMy name is Yujian Tang[0m
[33mand I've helped thousands of developers understand, use,[0m
[33mand contribute to the development and direction of AI.[0m
[33mSo if you are ready to master RAG,[0m
[33myou've come to the right place.[0m

[33mLet's jump in.[0m

[33m### What you should know[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructror[0m[1;33m][0m[33m This course assumes you have[0m
[33ma conceptual understanding of vector databases,[0m
[33membedding models, and large language models.[0m
[33mI also assume you understand the fundamentals[0m
[33mof how to write Python code.[0m
[33mBefore we dive into the course,[0m
[33mlet's review some of these topics[0m
[33mand how they're related to what we're about to learn here.[0m
[33mWe'll start with vector databases.[0m
[33mA vector database is a tool[0m
[33mthat helps you work with unstructured data[0m
[33min the form of vectors.[0m

[33mFun fact, the name vector database is actually a misnomer.[0m
[33mVector databases are not real databases,[0m
[33mbut rather compute engines for vector data.[0m
[33mVector data is often referred to as a vector embedding[0m
[33min the context of Generative AI.[0m
[33mAnd for the purpose of retrieval augmented generation,[0m
[33mwe will refer to vectors and embeddings as the same thing.[0m
[33mThese vectors are long series of numbers,[0m
[33mtypically hundreds or thousands of numbers.[0m
[33mThe reason we call them vector embeddings[0m
[33mis because they're generated by deep neural networks.[0m

[33mThey come from the second to last layer[0m
[33mof the neural network.[0m
[33mThat layer's output contains all of the information[0m
[33mthe network has learned[0m
[33mwithout applying the predictive layer.[0m
[33mThese deep neural networks[0m
[33mare what we refer to as embedding models.[0m
[33mEmbedding models can come in all sorts[0m
[33mof different shapes and sizes,[0m
[33mas well as work on all sorts of different data types.[0m
[33mThere are two critical things you need to know[0m
[33mabout using embedding models and vectors.[0m
[33mOne, you need to match up the data type and the model type.[0m

[33mFor example, you can only use[0m
[33membedding models for images on image data[0m
[33mand embedding models for text on text data.[0m
[33mEven in multimodal models,[0m
[33mwhich can work on multiple types of data,[0m
[33myou must specify which type of input data[0m
[33mis being used to produce the bright embeddings.[0m
[33mTwo, you can only compare vectors of the same size.[0m
[33mThis means you need to use the same embedding models[0m
[33mfor vectorization of your input data[0m
[33mas well as during the retrieval step of your RAG app.[0m

[33mSo where do large language models come in?[0m
[33mIn the context of RAG,[0m
[33mLLMs are the interface for interacting with your data.[0m
[33mMost LLMs, including GPT-[0m[1;33m4[0m
[33mare based off of the transformer model.[0m
[33mThey predict what the most likely next token is,[0m
[33mgiven the current set of tokens.[0m
[33mPublicly available LLMs are trained on large data sets[0m
[33mof publicly available data.[0m
[33mThis means they don't have access to your data,[0m
[33mwhich is where RAG comes in.[0m

[33mYou vectorize your data with embedding models,[0m
[33mput them into a vector database,[0m
[33mand then use an LLM to interface with that data.[0m
[33mIn a RAG app, the LLM takes in your question,[0m
[33myour question is then sent to the embedding model[0m
[33mwhere it's vectorized.[0m
[33mThen you search your vector database for similar embeddings[0m
[33mand return the relevant results[0m
[33mwhich are passed to the LMS as context.[0m
[33mThe LLM can now return an answer to you[0m
[33mthat makes sense based on the retrieved results.[0m
[33mWhen it comes to the software for this course,[0m
[33mwe'll be using Python [0m[1;33m3.11[0m[33m.[0m

[33mEach chapter has its own set of requirements[0m
[33mand you should use a clean virtual environment for each.[0m
[33mFeel free to use the IDE of your choice,[0m
[33mbut I'll be using VS Code.[0m

[33m### Setting up your exercise files[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Let's quickly cover[0m
[33mhow to set up your environment[0m
[33mfor the exercises in this course.[0m
[33mOnce you're on the GitHub repo, click Code,[0m
[33mand you'll see multiple options here to clone this repo.[0m
[33mClick Copy url to clipboard,[0m
[33mand go to your IDE where you can git clone the repo.[0m
[33mOnce you clone the repo, you can also ensure[0m
[33mthat you're using the right version of Python,[0m
[33mand you should be using Python [0m[1;33m3.11[0m[33m.[0m

[33mYou'll see here that we have multiple chapters,[0m
[33mand in each chapter, there is a file here that corresponds[0m
[33mto the video and the challenge in that chapter.[0m
[33mAlong with these, we also have a requirements document[0m
[33mfor each chapter,[0m
[33mand this requirements document contains[0m
[33mall of the libraries you need to run that chapter.[0m
[33mWhen you're working with these requirements files,[0m
[33mwhat you should do is spin up a clean virtual environment.[0m

[33mOnce you've activated that virtual environment,[0m
[33myou want to install all of the libraries[0m
[33min the requirements file,[0m
[33mand that's it.[0m
[33mOnce you install, you're ready to go.[0m

[33m## [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m. Optimizing RAG[0m

[33m### Introduction to preprocessing for RAG[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Before we can get[0m
[33minto building a RAG app,[0m
[33mwe have to pre-process the data.[0m
[33mIn this section, we'll cover three critical components[0m
[33min data, pre-processing for retrieval augmented generation,[0m
[33mchunking, embeddings, and metadata.[0m
[33mChunking is the process of breaking down big blocks[0m
[33mof text into smaller blocks.[0m
[33mEmbeddings are the vectors that are generated[0m
[33mby embedding models.[0m
[33mThey represent the semantic meaning[0m
[33mof some input data in a quantifiable fashion.[0m

[33mMetadata is data that gets stored along with embeddings[0m
[33min vector databases.[0m
[33mIt is critical to building customizable RAG applications.[0m
[33mWhy do you need to chunk your data?[0m
[33mIf you think about the way[0m
[33mthat you process information[0m
[33mand overlay that to how machines work,[0m
[33myou should get an intuitive understanding of chunking.[0m
[33mAs humans, we read books or documents,[0m
[33mone sentence or paragraph at a time.[0m
[33mIn other words, we read things[0m
[33min semantically coherent chunks.[0m

[33mIf you were to try to grab an entire book,[0m
[33mit would be nearly impossible.[0m
[33mComputers, and in this context, LLMs,[0m
[33mwork the same way.[0m
[33mWhen working with LLMs you may have heard[0m
[33mof something called the context window.[0m
[33mThe context window of an LLM is the maximum number[0m
[33mof tokens, which you can think of, like words[0m
[33mthat an LLM can work with at once.[0m
[33mWhen an LLM has a context window of say, [0m[1;33m128[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m,[0m
[33mlike GPT-[0m[1;33m4[0m[33m Turbo, you can think to yourself[0m
[33mthis LLM can hold roughly [0m[1;33m128[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m words[0m
[33min short-term memory.[0m

[33mThe context window is really just a cap.[0m
[33mIt doesn't represent what the ideal number of words[0m
[33mor tokens a model can work with is,[0m
[33mand how does this relate to chunking?[0m
[33mThis gives us a framework to start thinking[0m
[33mabout how we should chunk our data.[0m
[33mThe other piece of the puzzle is the type[0m
[33mof data that we have.[0m
[33mDifferent types of data[0m
[33mrequire different chunking strategies and approaches.[0m
[33mWe'll dive deeper into the world[0m
[33mof chunking in a later video.[0m
[33mAs we briefly mentioned in our overview[0m
[33mof prior knowledge,[0m
[33membeddings or embedding vectors[0m
[33mare just a series of numbers[0m
[33mthat represent some input data.[0m

[33mEmbeddings can be used to represent all sorts[0m
[33mof input data from text to images or video and even DNA.[0m
[33mThe important thing to remember about embeddings is[0m
[33mthat they give us a way to use vector databases[0m
[33mto compare data that we couldn't compare before.[0m
[33mThere are two main types of embeddings,[0m
[33mdense embeddings and sparse embeddings.[0m
[33mDense embeddings are embedding vectors[0m
[33mwhere only a few of the values are zero,[0m
[33mand dense embeddings are by and large created[0m
[33mby machine learning models.[0m

[33mSparse embeddings are embedding vectors[0m
[33mwhere many of the values are zero.[0m
[33mA good rule of thumb is that when more than half[0m
[33mof the values in your vector embeddings are zeros,[0m
[33myou have a sparse embedding.[0m
[33mSparse embeddings are mostly created by algorithms.[0m
[33mFor the purpose of RAG,[0m
[33mwe'll mostly work with dense embeddings.[0m
[33mThe final piece in data pre-processing[0m
[33mfor RAG is the metadata.[0m
[33mMetadata is data[0m
[33mthat gets stored alongside your embeddings[0m
[33min a vector database.[0m

[33mYour metadata is critical[0m
[33mto optimizing your RAG application.[0m
[33mMetadata can include information[0m
[33mabout your data itself,[0m
[33mas well as information[0m
[33mabout how the specific data point relates[0m
[33mto the larger dataset.[0m
[33mWhen you are building a RAG application,[0m
[33myour metadata must include the text[0m
[33mthat you are vectorizing.[0m
[33mThe vector database retrieves similar data based[0m
[33mon the vector embeddings,[0m
[33mbut LLMs are not able[0m
[33mto directly convert vector embeddings into text.[0m

[33mThe relevant text must be included[0m
[33min the data point so that the LLM can read it.[0m
[33mOne of the main uses of metadata[0m
[33min a RAG application is[0m
[33mthat it's used to filter searches.[0m
[33mAs we talked about previously,[0m
[33mmetadata can be processing metadata[0m
[33mor metadata about the data itself.[0m
[33mExamples of processing metadata[0m
[33mcan include section title,[0m
[33mparagraph number, and chunk location.[0m
[33mExamples of data-related metadata[0m
[33mcan include the embedded data itself,[0m
[33mpublication date, and the author.[0m

[33mNow that we have an overview of the three pieces[0m
[33mof optimizing a RAG app,[0m
[33mchunking, embeddings, and metadata,[0m
[33mlet's dive deeper into how each of these pieces work.[0m

[33m### Chunking considerations[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m The first pre-processing step to discuss[0m
[33mis chunking.[0m
[33mChunking is how we make documents consumable[0m
[33mfor generative AI use cases like RAG.[0m
[33mChunking is the process of splitting up documents[0m
[33minto smaller chunks of text.[0m
[33mThese chunks need to be small enough[0m
[33mto be consumable, coherent and contextual,[0m
[33mso let's break that down.[0m
[33mWhat makes a chunk consumable?[0m
[33mFrom a technical perspective,[0m
[33ma consumable chunk must fit into the context window[0m
[33mof your chosen embedding model.[0m

[33mOn top of that, at least three of these chunks[0m
[33mmust fit into the context window of your chosen LLM.[0m
[33mThe number of these chunks that have to fit[0m
[33minto your LLM context window is dependent[0m
[33mon the top K you've chosen[0m
[33mfor your vector database retrieval,[0m
[33mwhich we'll touch more on embedding models[0m
[33mas well as top K for retrievals and vector databases later.[0m
[33mFrom a common sense perspective.[0m
[33mYou want to ensure that you can consume[0m
[33mor read your chunk in one go.[0m

[33mWhat makes a chunk coherent?[0m
[33mA coherent chunk is one that makes sense.[0m
[33mIf you read the chunk of text and it makes you go, [0m[33m"Huh,"[0m
[33mthat is not a coherent chunk of text.[0m
[33mFrom a technical perspective,[0m
[33myou want to ensure that your chunks don't start and stop[0m
[33min the middle of a word, clause, or sentence.[0m
[33mFrom a common sense perspective,[0m
[33myou want your chunks of text[0m
[33mto be sets of complete thoughts.[0m
[33mFor example, [0m[33m"Curiosity killed the cat"[0m[33m is a coherent chunk,[0m
[33m"killed the"[0m[33m is not.[0m

[33mThe last C of chunking is contextual.[0m
[33mWhat makes a chunk contextual?[0m
[33mThis one is a little different from the other two.[0m
[33mThe technical and common sense perspectives of contextual[0m
[33mare more or less the same thing.[0m
[33mThe idea behind contextual chunking[0m
[33mis that you get chunks of text[0m
[33mthat contain all the necessary context to answer a question.[0m
[33mFor example, [0m[33m"Curiosity killed the cat"[0m
[33mmay be a coherent chunk,[0m
[33mbut it is often taken out of context of the full saying,[0m
[33mand the full saying is "Curiosity killed the cat,[0m
[33mbut satisfaction brought it back."[0m
[33mIf you take things out of context,[0m
[33myou may not derive their full meaning.[0m

[33mAs Stewart Stafford said, "Separate texts from context[0m
[33mand all that remains is a con."[0m
[33mWhen it comes to chunking,[0m
[33mthere are three major considerations to take into account.[0m
[33mThese are the size of your chunks,[0m
[33mhow much chunks overlap with each other,[0m
[33mand whether or not we should use special characters[0m
[33mto mark where to split chunks.[0m
[33mChunk size is a pretty self-explanatory term.[0m
[33mThe chunk size refers the number of characters in a chunk.[0m

[33mPicking your chunk size is largely dependent[0m
[33mon the structure of your data,[0m
[33mand we'll look at some examples later.[0m
[33mFor reference, most paragraphs[0m
[33mare about [0m[1;33m100[0m[33m words or [0m[1;33m500[0m[33m characters,[0m
[33mand that's a good place to start for your chunk size.[0m
[33mDepending on which method you use to chunk your data,[0m
[33myour chunk size may be used as a hard limit[0m
[33mor just a guideline, more on this later.[0m
[33mMuch like chunk size,[0m
[33mchunk overlap is a relatively self-explanatory term.[0m

[33mChunk overlap refers to the number of characters repeated[0m
[33mbetween consecutive chunks.[0m
[33mWhy would you want to have overlapping sections[0m
[33mbetween different chunks of data?[0m
[33mThere's two ways to think about how this helps.[0m
[33mFirst, you can think about chunk overlap[0m
[33mas the way to preserve context between chunks.[0m
[33mIf you have the last sentence or paragraph[0m
[33mof the chunk before,[0m
[33myou have extra context into the current chunk.[0m

[33mSecond, you can think about it as a tool[0m
[33mto help reinforce the guidelines[0m
[33mof chunks being consumable, coherent, and contextual.[0m
[33mSpecial characters.[0m
[33mUnfortunately, there is no industry standard[0m
[33mon what these are called and how these are referenced,[0m
[33mand I couldn't really come up with a better name.[0m
[33mBut these are characters[0m
[33mthat you want to split your text up on.[0m
[33mThese can be used in conjunction with chunk size[0m
[33mand chunk overlap to allow you to relax restrictions[0m
[33maround chunk size and overlap[0m
[33mto create more coherent chunks.[0m

[33mFor example, let's say you want to ensure[0m
[33mall your splits are in complete sentences,[0m
[33mbut your chunk sizing the number of characters per chunk[0m
[33mdoesn't always end on a complete sentence.[0m
[33mWhat do you do?[0m
[33mYou can use special characters to relax this restriction[0m
[33mby allowing your chunks to go oversize[0m
[33mand end at the next period,[0m
[33mdouble new line, single new line,[0m
[33mor any other special character that you want.[0m


[33m### Chunking examples[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Let's look at some examples[0m
[33mof types of texts you may chunk.[0m
[33mThere are many types of documents[0m
[33mthat you'll face as you build[0m
[33mretrieval augmented generation apps in production.[0m
[33mLet's take a look at three common types of documents[0m
[33mand how to chunk them.[0m
[33mFirst, we'll look at document data.[0m
[33mThis is the type of data that[0m
[33myou would typically think of as a document,[0m
[33mthings like research papers, books, or perhaps blogs.[0m
[33mSecond, question answered transcripts.[0m

[33mAn example of a Q/A transcript would be something like[0m
[33man AMA that you find on Reddit.[0m
[33mYou'll need to keep the questions and answers coupled,[0m
[33mas well as make sure they are in separate chunks.[0m
[33mThird, chat transcripts.[0m
[33mLet's start with document style data.[0m
[33mDocument data is probably the most widely used form of data[0m
[33mfor information retrieval.[0m
[33mThis style of data includes things[0m
[33mlike papers, reports, and documentation.[0m

[33mExamples of papers include the research publications[0m
[33mthat you find on archive,[0m
[33man essay from a writer that you like,[0m
[33mor a blog post that you may have on your website.[0m
[33mExamples of reports include things[0m
[33mlike the report that you write for your boss,[0m
[33mthe news article about the latest news,[0m
[33mor a lab report a student writes for class.[0m
[33mExamples of documentation[0m
[33minclude things like the write-up about the latest project[0m
[33myour software engineering team is supposed to make,[0m
[33ma guide on how to use some machinery,[0m
[33mor API docs for how to use an open source library.[0m

[33mOne of the defining features of document data[0m
[33mis that the text is usually organized[0m
[33min regularly sized blocks.[0m
[33mYou typically won't find too much variation[0m
[33min the size of a semantically coherent chunk of text[0m
[33mwithin these documents.[0m
[33mThis type of text data lends itself[0m
[33mto easier chunk sizing and chunk overlap choice.[0m
[33mTypically, you won't even have to worry too much[0m
[33mabout splitting on special characters,[0m
[33mmost of the time you can just split on double new lines.[0m

[33mQ/A transcripts can be from things[0m
[33mlike podcasts, classes, and talks.[0m
[33mThese transcripts can be pulled from things[0m
[33mlike your favorite podcast,[0m
[33mthe lecture you were supposed to attend[0m
[33mthat you slept through,[0m
[33mor the Tech Talks by OSS for AI[0m
[33mthat you wish you were able to make.[0m
[33mThe defining features of Q/A transcripts[0m
[33mis that they typically have these short-long snippets.[0m
[33mUsually, the question asked is short[0m
[33mand the answer is longer.[0m

[33mOf course, sometimes, that won't be the case,[0m
[33mbut most of the time, it will be.[0m
[33mThe other defining characteristic[0m
[33mis that Q/A transcripts typically have[0m
[33msemantically linked chunks.[0m
[33mA question and an answer[0m
[33mare semantically linked to each other.[0m
[33mUsually, the answer doesn't make sense[0m
[33mwithout linking to the question.[0m
[33mThis lends itself to two styles[0m
[33mthat are actually more important to metadata than chunking[0m
[33mthat we'll touch on later,[0m
[33mbut the basic idea is that[0m
[33myou can store metadata of different chunks[0m
[33mto remind the program that they're linked.[0m

[33mExamples of chat transcripts[0m
[33minclude customer support, texts and DMs.[0m
[33mYou may get these transcripts[0m
[33mfrom things like your phone call[0m
[33mor instant messaging with text support[0m
[33mfor your cell phone coverage provider,[0m
[33mtexts between you and a friend or group chat,[0m
[33mand DMs on LinkedIn.[0m
[33mThe defining feature of chat transcripts[0m
[33mis irregularly sized chunks and unpredictable linking.[0m
[33mUnlike Q/A transcripts,[0m
[33myou can't use a rule like answers usually follow questions.[0m

[33mSometimes you have the same person[0m
[33msending multiple messages in a row,[0m
[33mand these messages are rarely the same size.[0m
[33mUnlike document data,[0m
[33myou can't rely on regularly sized data,[0m
[33mand sometimes messages are a sentence,[0m
[33msometimes a word, sometimes a paragraph.[0m
[33mIn chat transcripts,[0m
[33mspecial characters are especially important.[0m
[33mThis is where you really need something[0m
[33mthat separates each message[0m
[33min some way to see who wrote that message.[0m
[33mOnce again, something to be covered in metadata.[0m


[33m### Introduction to embeddings[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Now that we've wrapped up chunking,[0m
[33mlet's cover embeddings.[0m
[33mBefore vector embeddings,[0m
[33mwe didn't have a way to compare unstructured data.[0m
[33mWith embedding models, we do.[0m
[33mEmbedding models are machine learning models,[0m
[33malmost always deep neural networks,[0m
[33mthat turn your text, images, videos, audio,[0m
[33mwhatever kind of data you have[0m
[33minto vectors or vector embeddings.[0m
[33mVectors are the tools we use[0m
[33mto quantitatively compare unstructured data.[0m

[33mRemember that it's important to use[0m
[33mthe correct embedding models[0m
[33mto embed whatever data you have.[0m
[33mIn most contexts,[0m
[33mthat refers to embedding models trained on your data type.[0m
[33mFor example, using ResNet50 for image embeddings,[0m
[33musing Sentence Transformers for your text,[0m
[33mor using Whisper for your audio.[0m
[33mIn this context,[0m
[33mwe are primarily concerned with embedding text.[0m
[33mThe rise in popularity of large language models[0m
[33mlate in [0m[1;33m2022[0m[33m and all of [0m[1;33m2023[0m
[33mshowed us that text is one of the most important mediums[0m
[33mfor AI to work with.[0m

[33mAs such, there are now hundreds[0m
[33mof embedding models specifically for text.[0m
[33mYou can find a list of these models[0m
[33mon the Hugging Face MTEB[0m
[33mMassive Text Embedding Benchmark's leaderboard.[0m
[33mThat's MTEB, M-T-E-B.[0m
[33mIf you're working in an extremely specialized domain though,[0m
[33meven MTEB is not a comprehensive list.[0m
[33mFor example,[0m
[33mCSV documents require their own embedding models.[0m

[33mAnd if you think about it,[0m
[33mthe way the CSVs are set up is extremely different[0m
[33mfrom the way that regular text is set up.[0m
[33mIn CSVs, commas are used to separate entries or entities.[0m
[33mIn regular text,[0m
[33mcommas are used to signal a pause in thought[0m
[33mor to separate phrases, clauses, or positives.[0m
[33mWhen it comes to embedding your text for later use,[0m
[33mthere are many things to think about,[0m
[33mbut if you take care of these three,[0m
[33mthe rest often fall into line.[0m

[33mThe three critical considerations in embedding your data[0m
[33mis the embedding model itself,[0m
[33mwhat you want to embed,[0m
[33mand how to compare your embeddings.[0m
[33mLet's look at the three pieces of picking the right model.[0m
[33mThe three pieces that go into picking an embedding model[0m
[33mare embedding size, model size, and training data.[0m
[33mFirst, embedding size.[0m
[33mEmbedding size is the size of the embedding vector.[0m
[33mThis is also referred to as the length[0m
[33mor the dimensionality of the vector.[0m

[33mRemember that vectors are just lists of numbers.[0m
[33mThese vectors are typically produced[0m
[33mby a deep neural network.[0m
[33mThey're the output[0m
[33mof the second to last layer of the network.[0m
[33mWhen you put data into an neural net,[0m
[33meach layer learns something about the data,[0m
[33mand the final layer takes that information[0m
[33mand makes a prediction or classification.[0m
[33mThe second to last layer contains all of the information[0m
[33mwithout making a prediction on it.[0m
[33mThe size of the embedding affects the computational power[0m
[33mneeded to compare vectors when you use them.[0m

[33mIt is critical to remember here[0m
[33mthat only embeddings of the same size can be compared.[0m
[33mSecond, model size.[0m
[33mMuch like the size of embeddings,[0m
[33mthe size of the model you choose[0m
[33malso has an effect on computational power.[0m
[33mSmaller embedding models are less expensive overall.[0m
[33mThey're less expensive to use both to create embeddings[0m
[33mand once you have the embeddings.[0m
[33mMeanwhile, larger models[0m
[33mcan give you more fine-grained results,[0m
[33mwhich may be necessary depending on what you're doing.[0m

[33mOne last thing to remember[0m
[33mis that embedding models are not always LLMs.[0m
[33mWhile LLMs can be used as embedding models,[0m
[33mthese are not the same thing.[0m
[33mThird is training data.[0m
[33mThe data that your model is trained on is always important.[0m
[33mDifferent models on the MTEB leaderboard[0m
[33mare trained on different datasets.[0m
[33mExamples of how the data[0m
[33mand the training set can change your model[0m
[33minclude language, structure, and data size.[0m

[33mFor example, models trained on Chinese[0m
[33mcan help you embed data in Chinese,[0m
[33mbut probably not Arabic.[0m
[33mModels trained on chat style data[0m
[33mare better for embedding conversational input[0m
[33mthan for embedding essays.[0m
[33mLet's also look at algorithmic models.[0m
[33mThese are a special case[0m
[33mand these are not neural nets.[0m
[33mThese are algorithms[0m
[33mand typically produce a different type of embedding.[0m
[33mExamples can include TF-IDF,[0m
[33mterm frequency inverse document frequency,[0m
[33mSPLADE, sparse lexical and expansion models,[0m
[33mand BM25, where BM stands for best matching.[0m

[33mThese algorithms produce binary or sparse embeddings,[0m
[33mas we talked about before.[0m
[33mMeasuring the similarity between these models[0m
[33mis also different than the others,[0m
[33mbut we'll talk about that later.[0m
[33mWhen it comes to picking what you want to embed,[0m
[33mthere are three main options.[0m
[33mYou can embed the chunked text,[0m
[33myou can embed a portion of the chunk's text,[0m
[33mor you can embed the larger chunk[0m
[33mor section that your chunk text is part of.[0m

[33mAt this point, a question naturally arises.[0m
[33mIf I spent so much time making my chunks good,[0m
[33mwhy would I not just embed them?[0m
[33mOnce again, because we are working[0m
[33mwith programmatic methods,[0m
[33mthese techniques are there[0m
[33mto enhance your chunking methods.[0m
[33mLarge to small refers to a technique[0m
[33mwhere you embed large paragraphs,[0m
[33mbut store individual senses as the metadata.[0m
[33mAnd small to large refers to a technique[0m
[33mwhere you embed individual sentences[0m
[33mbut store the large paragraph in the metadata.[0m

[33mRemember that vectors are just long lists of numbers.[0m
[33mWhile there are many distance metrics[0m
[33mthat can be used to compare vectors,[0m
[33mthere are three main distance calculations,[0m
[33mcosine, inner product, and Euclidean.[0m
[33mEuclidean distance measures the spatial distance[0m
[33mbetween two vectors.[0m
[33mThe best way to imagine vectors for Euclidean distance[0m
[33mis to imagine the two points in hyperspace[0m
[33mthat the vectors point at,[0m
[33mand then imagine the distance between those two points.[0m

[33mThe formula for Euclidean distance[0m
[33mis the square root[0m
[33mof the sum of the difference between each entry.[0m
[33min the two vectors squared.[0m
[33mCosine similarity measures the difference[0m
[33min orientation of two vectors.[0m
[33mUnlike Euclidean distance,[0m
[33mcosine similarity has us think of the vectors[0m
[33mas arrows in hyperspace,[0m
[33mwhere we're measuring is the orientational difference[0m
[33mbetween the two arrows at the origin.[0m

[33mThis distance metric is the most complicated[0m
[33mand computationally expensive distance measure[0m
[33mfor dense vectors.[0m
[33mCosine similarity is the normalized dot product[0m
[33mof two vectors.[0m
[33mThe formula is the dot product of A and B[0m
[33mdivided by the magnitude of A times the magnitude of B.[0m
[33mAnother way to express it[0m
[33mis the sum of the product of each entry in the vectors[0m
[33mdivided by the product of the square roots[0m
[33mof the square of each term in each vector.[0m

[33mInner product or dot product[0m
[33mis the simplest of these three measures of similarity.[0m
[33mThe way to think about this measure[0m
[33mis to think about the vectors as arrows[0m
[33mand then think about the projection[0m
[33mof one vector onto another.[0m
[33mWe saw this formula earlier in the cosine similarity slide.[0m
[33mThe formula for inner product[0m
[33mis the sum of the product of each entry in the vectors.[0m
[33mThis is cosine similarity[0m
[33mwithout dividing by the product of the magnitudes.[0m

[33mSo for sparse or binary vectors,[0m
[33mthere are two distance metrics that we should know,[0m
[33mHamming distance and Jaccard distance.[0m
[33mHamming distance is measured as the number of points[0m
[33min which two binary vectors are different.[0m
[33mAnd Hamming distance can be measured[0m
[33mby first taking an XOR of two vectors[0m
[33mand then summing all of the 1s in the result.[0m
[33mThe other binary distance metric[0m
[33mthat's good to measure on is Jaccard distance.[0m

[33mJaccard distance is [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m minus the Jaccard similarity.[0m
[33mThe Jaccard similarity is the intersection of two vectors.[0m
[33mAnother way to calculate Jaccard distance[0m
[33mis the difference of the union of A and B[0m
[33mand the intersection of A and B[0m
[33mdivided by the union of A and B.[0m
[33mIf both vectors are [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m in an entry,[0m
[33mthen that counts as an intersection point.[0m
[33mIf either vector has a [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m,[0m

[33m### Embedding examples[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mPresenter[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Let's look at some examples[0m
[33mof how you can embed data.[0m
[33mThere are many ways to embed[0m
[33mand there are many things that you can embed.[0m
[33mThe three primary methods we'll cover[0m
[33mfor embedding in this section are the basic embeddings,[0m
[33msmall to big, and big to small,[0m
[33mand we'll also briefly discuss non-English examples.[0m
[33mThe most basic method of embedding[0m
[33mis to just straight up embed the chunk.[0m
[33mSometimes this works for your most basic tasks.[0m

[33mHowever, when it comes to advanced RAG use cases[0m
[33mand putting things into production,[0m
[33myou're going to need something a little more involved.[0m
[33mSmall to big is a term coined by former LlamaIndex head[0m
[33mof TypeScript and Partnerships, Yi Ding,[0m
[33mand he coined it at one of my first events in San Francisco.[0m
[33mThe idea behind small to big is that you embed a sentence,[0m
[33mbut you store the whole paragraph as text.[0m

[33mWhy would you do this?[0m
[33mWell, it's good for increased context.[0m
[33mSome texts have very short sentences,[0m
[33mand it's helpful to retrieve not just the sentence[0m
[33mor the one sentence proceeding or following it,[0m
[33mbut the entire paragraph in which that sentence was used.[0m
[33mThis is another way to help ensure semantic coherence[0m
[33mlike we covered in chunking.[0m
[33mBig to small is the opposite of small to big.[0m

[33mInstead of embedding a sentence and storing a paragraph,[0m
[33mwe embed a paragraph and store a sentence.[0m
[33mWell, why would we do this?[0m
[33mSometimes sentences themselves don't always make sense,[0m
[33mand the tactics of chunking sentences[0m
[33mmay leave some sentences broken.[0m
[33mFor example, if we have a period following Mr.,[0m
[33mthen we may have a broken sentence.[0m
[33mEmbedding a whole paragraph[0m
[33mand retrieving all the sentences separately[0m
[33mlets us do some post-processing[0m
[33mbefore feeding the chunks to an LLM[0m
[33mto ensure that we get the right context.[0m

[33mFinally, we're looking at non-English embeddings.[0m
[33mHere's a special case.[0m
[33mIf you're not working with English data,[0m
[33myou'll need an embedding model[0m
[33mthat was trained on non-English data.[0m
[33mYou have a few options.[0m
[33mOne of the easiest, but perhaps the not the most efficient[0m
[33mor cost-effective methods,[0m
[33mis to use an LLM that has multiple language data.[0m
[33mExamples include GPT models beyond [0m[1;33m3.5[0m[33m, Mixtral, and Queen.[0m

[33mIf you're looking for a more compute-friendly option,[0m
[33myou can search the MTEB leaderboards[0m
[33mfor models in different languages[0m
[33msuch as French, Polish, Chinese, and more.[0m

[33m### Metadata[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Metadata is the final piece[0m
[33mof what makes vector databases useful.[0m
[33mWithout storing metadata,[0m
[33mwe would just be comparing a bunch of numbers.[0m
[33mThe term metadata encompasses all of the data[0m
[33mthat gets stored with your vector embeddings.[0m
[33mWhen it comes to retrieval, augmented generation,[0m
[33mwe definitely need to store the actual text[0m
[33mthat the vector embedding was generated from,[0m
[33mand we can also store many other types of metadata.[0m

[33mSo what is metadata?[0m
[33mOther than the text itself?[0m
[33mThere are many different types of metadata.[0m
[33mYou can think of metadata in many different ways.[0m
[33mIt's the data that isn't the embeddings[0m
[33mthat you store in your vector database.[0m
[33mA lot of this data falls into the category of data[0m
[33mthat gets stored in traditional databases,[0m
[33mand we'll cover more examples later in this video.[0m
[33mYou also need to remember that metadata is critical for RAG.[0m
[33mIt's not just critical for performing basic RAG[0m
[33mby providing the text and unvectorized data,[0m
[33mbut also critical for advanced usage like filtering.[0m

[33mI would split metadata into two general types,[0m
[33mchunking metadata and non chunking metadata.[0m
[33mThis categorization is based on where the metadata[0m
[33mis coming from.[0m
[33mChunking metadata is metadata that comes out[0m
[33mof the chunking process.[0m
[33mExamples of chunking metadata include the sentence number,[0m
[33mthe subtitle, or the section header.[0m
[33mYou can think about this type of metadata as the metadata[0m
[33mthat tells you where in the document the current chunk[0m
[33myou're working with comes from.[0m

[33mThe main usage for this metadata is context and filtering.[0m
[33mYou can use chunking metadata[0m
[33mto understand more about the context of a chunk,[0m
[33msuch as through the subtitles, as well as filter the chunks.[0m
[33mFor example, you may want chunks[0m
[33monly from a certain section.[0m
[33mThe other type of metadata is non-chunking metadata.[0m
[33mAll this means is that the metadata was not produced[0m
[33mnor tied to the chunking process.[0m

[33mExamples of non-chunking metadata include the author,[0m
[33mthe last time an entry was updated, or the document title.[0m
[33mThe main usage for non chunking metadata[0m
[33mis for filtering your search.[0m
[33mFor example, you may only want data that was written by you[0m
[33mor updated in the last month.[0m
[33mSo how can we store metadata?[0m
[33mAs we mentioned before, a lot of metadata,[0m
[33malmost all of the non-chunky metadata is metadata[0m
[33mthat was traditionally stored in a relational database.[0m

[33mSo one option is to link to where your metadata was stored.[0m
[33mAnother option that is more popular for RAG applications[0m
[33mis to store your metadata directly[0m
[33min the vector store itself.[0m
[33mIt's easier and faster to store your metadata directly[0m
[33mwith your vectors and use it for info[0m
[33mand filtering that way.[0m

[33m### Demo: Chunking[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m With our data ready,[0m
[33mwe can work on the first part[0m
[33mof our RAG application, chunking.[0m
[33mAs we mentioned earlier, chunking is the process[0m
[33mof breaking large texts up into small, workable pieces.[0m
[33mIn the first block here, we're going to import three things.[0m
[33mThe document object, the character text splitter object,[0m
[33mand the OS library.[0m
[33mThe document object is LangChain's native way[0m
[33mto store objects.[0m
[33mWe use this to add metadata to our text[0m
[33mand prepare it for the vector store.[0m

[33mThe character text splitter object is a LangChain object[0m
[33mthat can split strings up based on some preset parameters.[0m
[33mIn our case, we use it for determining chunk size[0m
[33mand chunk overlap.[0m
[33mThe third functional import is the OS library,[0m
[33mand we use this for navigating the directory structure[0m
[33mof the operating system.[0m
[33mNow for the functionality,[0m
[33mparsing and chunking the data.[0m
[33mFirst, we make sure that we're using the right folder.[0m
[33mIn this case, we are using the Big Star Collectibles folder.[0m

[33mTo access the list of text files within this folder,[0m
[33mwe use the OS library to get a list of the directory.[0m
[33mNext, we create an empty list object[0m
[33mto hold all of the chunked up texts[0m
[33mthat we're going to create,[0m
[33mthen we start looping through all of the files[0m
[33mand chunking them up.[0m
[33mSo, what do we do in this loop?[0m
[33mWe start by opening up our file and reading the entire page[0m
[33min as a single string.[0m
[33mNext, we create a CharacterTextSplitter object.[0m

[33mThis specific instance is set up[0m
[33mto split strings into [0m[1;33m128[0m[33m character chunks[0m
[33mwith [0m[1;33m32[0m[33m character overlaps,[0m
[33mthen we use the object's split_text function[0m
[33mand pass the string containing our entire file through[0m
[33mto get our chunks.[0m
[33mThe last bit of functionality in the chunking section[0m
[33mis to loop through each of these chunked texts[0m
[33mand create a document object from each chunk.[0m
[33mTo ensure that we keep the chunks[0m
[33mstored in our vector store,[0m
[33mwe assign it to the page_content parameter.[0m

[33mWhen you run the cell,[0m
[33myou may notice that some of these chunks[0m
[33mare larger than the specified chunk size of [0m[1;33m128[0m[33m,[0m
[33mand we'll address this in one of the challenges later on.[0m
[33mFinally, let's take one block of code[0m
[33mto just look at the chunk.[0m
[33mLooking at the first chunk,[0m
[33mwe can see the beginnings[0m
[33mof the Binaryville text file.[0m

[33m### Demo: Metadata[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m This section is about storing metadata[0m
[33mwith our chunk data.[0m
[33mWe'll start from the exact same place we left off[0m
[33min the last video.[0m
[33mThere's only a small change to make here.[0m
[33mIn link chain, metadata is stored[0m
[33mwithin the document object.[0m
[33mLast time we stored the chunks[0m
[33min the page content parameter.[0m
[33mTo store metadata, all we need to do is add[0m
[33ma metadata parameter.[0m
[33mMetadata is stored as a dictionary.[0m

[33mYou can define the metadata that you want to store.[0m
[33mOne of the most common pieces of metadata to store[0m
[33mis the title of the document.[0m
[33mFor this example, we store this under doc title.[0m
[33mWe'll also store the chunk number.[0m
[33mThis tells us where in the document[0m
[33mthe chunk was taken from.[0m
[33mOther than adding the metadata parameter[0m
[33mto the last co snippet,[0m
[33mthere's another change to make here as well.[0m
[33mWe enumerate through the list[0m
[33minstead of just looping through it.[0m

[33mThis is so we can access the chunk number[0m
[33mand know where in the document the chunk was taken from.[0m
[33mLet's take a look at our page content and metadata.[0m
[33mSee here that with this file text,[0m
[33mwe now have the chunk number[0m
[33mas well as the title of the document that it came from.[0m

[33mwe are ready to embed the data[0m
[33mand store it into a vector database.[0m
[33mWe're working with two new imports here,[0m
[33mFAISS and HuggingFaceEmbeddings.[0m
[33mFAISS stands for Facebook AI Similarity Search.[0m
[33mThis is the library[0m
[33mthat most popular AI native vector databases are built on,[0m
[33mand you'll see that we're importing HuggingFaceEmbeddings[0m
[33mfrom langchain_community.[0m

[33mEarly on, the LangChain team[0m
[33mbuilt hundreds of integrations for their library,[0m
[33mbut over time, as LangChain became more popular,[0m
[33mthis became impossible for their team to maintain,[0m
[33mand most of these spun out[0m
[33minto the Lang Chain community library,[0m
[33mincluding the HuggingFaceEmbeddings.[0m
[33mPicking up from where we left off in the last video,[0m
[33mwe started by importing the face library from LangChain[0m
[33mand the HuggingFaceEmbeddings from the community module.[0m

[33mNext, we instantiate the HuggingFaceEmbeddings object[0m
[33mas a function.[0m
[33mAt the time this course is being made,[0m
[33mthe default embedding model included[0m
[33mis all-mpnet-base-v2.[0m
[33mThis model has [0m[1;33m768[0m[33m dimensions.[0m
[33mRemember that only vectors[0m
[33mof the same dimensionality can be compared.[0m
[33mIn the next cell,[0m
[33min the metadata and chunking videos.[0m

[33mWe pass in the embedding function we created[0m
[33mfor all-mpnet-v2,[0m
[33mas well as the documents we created in the first two videos.[0m
[33mNow that we're done with this section,[0m
[33mwe've stored our text into our vector database,[0m
[33mand in the next step,[0m
[33mwe'll query our vector database[0m
[33mbefore we add an LLM on top to complete our RAG application.[0m

[33m### Demo: Querying[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Querying the vector database[0m

[33min a RAG application.[0m
[33mThe LLM queries the vector_store[0m
[33mto get some context back to create a response.[0m
[33mWhen we interact with the RAG app,[0m
[33mwe never see this query.[0m
[33mIn this video, we're going to take a peek behind the scenes[0m
[33mto see what the LLM sees.[0m
[33mWhen we query a vector database,[0m
[33mwe get some top_k results back.[0m
[33mFor langchain FAISS, the default k is [0m[1;33m4[0m[33m, as shown here.[0m

[33mThe first step to perform a vector_store query in langchain[0m
[33mis to take our vector_store[0m
[33mand call the as_retriever function on it.[0m
[33mThis prepares the vector_store to be queried with strings[0m
[33mand abstracts out the necessity[0m
[33mof turning a string into an embedding[0m
[33mand calling a query function directly.[0m
[33mThen, we call the invoke function of the retriever[0m
[33mand pass a string.[0m
[33mThe result is the top four results[0m
[33mthat are in our vector_store[0m
[33mas according to the embedding model we defined earlier.[0m


[33m### Demo: Adding the LLM[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m The final part of creating a RAG application[0m
[33mon top of our vector store is to add the LLM.[0m
[33mFor this part, you'll need access to an LLM.[0m
[33mYou can do this in the form of an API key[0m
[33mfrom OctoAI, OpenAI, or some other LLM provider.[0m
[33mAlternatively, you can run your own LLM locally.[0m
[33mThis course assumes that you are using an OpenAI API key.[0m
[33mWe kick off our LLM access[0m
[33mby importing our environment variables[0m
[33mand loading them using Python-dotenv's load_dotenv method.[0m

[33mThen, we import OpenAI from langchain_openai,[0m
[33mand initialize this as our LLM.[0m
[33mNext, we create a prompt template for our chat.[0m
[33mThe main thing to pay attention to in the prompt creation[0m
[33mis that we use it to pass the question[0m
[33mand the context via brackets,[0m
[33mjust like we would with an f-stringing in Python.[0m
[33mOnce we create a prompt string,[0m
[33mwe can use the ChatPromptTemplate object from langchain[0m
[33mto create a prompt template.[0m

[33mWe need two more imports to create our chain.[0m
[33mThe RunnablePassthrough object takes a string[0m
[33mand lets us treat it as a function[0m
[33mby just passing the string through the function.[0m
[33mThe StrOutputParser object takes the output of the chain[0m
[33mand parses it as a string.[0m
[33mTo create a chain,[0m
[33mwe start by getting the context and the question[0m
[33musing the objects we mentioned earlier.[0m
[33mThen, we pass it to the prompt we created[0m
[33mand pass the prompt to the LLM,[0m
[33mand finally, pipe the output of the LLM[0m
[33mto the StrOutputParser.[0m

[33mOnce the chain is created,[0m
[33mwe can get a response by simply invoking the chain.[0m
[33mThe response will take the queries we saw[0m
[33min the query video, combine them,[0m
[33mand return a single string from the given context.[0m
[33mNow that we've seen how to build an example,[0m
[33mit's time to put your learnings into practice.[0m

[33m### Challenge: Change the chunk size[0m

[1;33m([0m[33mupbeat electronic music[0m[1;33m)[0m
[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m When we run the chunking section[0m
[33mof the notebook,[0m
[33mwe can see that there's some warnings produced.[0m
[33mSome of the chunks are larger than the specified chunk size.[0m
[33mIn this challenge, we're going to modify the code slightly[0m
[33mso that our chunks stay within the chunk size[0m
[33mwithout enforcing any rules[0m
[33mthat will break semantic coherence of each chunk.[0m

[33mHere's a hint.[0m
[33mYou can read the code for CharacterTextSplitter[0m
[33mto solve this challenge.[0m
[33mSo go ahead and give this a try[0m

[33mwe can see that there's two parameters here[0m
[33mthat are automatically set,[0m
[33mseparator and is_separator_Reg X.[0m
[33mNow we can see that the separator parameter[0m
[33mis a double new line.[0m
[33mWhat this means is that even if it goes over the chunk size,[0m
[33mif it doesn't see any double new lines,[0m
[33mit may not form a new chunk.[0m

[33mSo if we want to ensure that we are forming chunks[0m
[33maround the correct chunk size,[0m
[33mwhat we should do is we should add a separator here[0m
[33mand we should define our own custom separator.[0m
[33mIn this case, we're going to define a new line,[0m
[33ma single new line as our own custom separator.[0m
[33mAnd when we run that, we'll see[0m
[33mthat we have everything in the correct chunk size[0m

[33mWhen it comes to using vector embeddings to compare images,[0m
[33mthere are two main types of vectors, semantic vectors,[0m
[33mand visual vectors.[0m
[33mThese vectors describe the image[0m
[33min fundamentally different ways.[0m
[33mLet's cover how.[0m
[33mThe first type of vector embedding[0m
[33mwe can use for comparing images are semantic embeddings.[0m

[33mThese embedding describe the meaning of the image.[0m
[33mThe second type of embeddings are visual[0m
[33mor pixel embeddings.[0m
[33mThese encode what the image literally looks like.[0m
[33mSemantic embeddings are derived from deep learning models.[0m
[33mIn any deep learning model,[0m
[33mthe image data gets passed from the input layer,[0m
[33mthrough a series of hidden layers,[0m
[33mand then to an output layer.[0m
[33mUsually the output layer outputs some sort of prediction,[0m
[33mclassification, or segmentation.[0m

[33mThe second to last layer contains[0m
[33mall of the meaning that the model has derived[0m

[33myou'll remember the images are compressed into a vector[0m

[33mAnd that's what these visual or pixel vectors are.[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m In order to understand[0m
[33mhow machines compare images,[0m
[33mwe're going to do a crash course of how vision models work.[0m
[33mRemember that vision models are just a type[0m
[33mof deep neural network.[0m
[33mThey are deep neural networks[0m
[33mthat are trained for computer vision tasks,[0m
[33msuch as classification of images,[0m
[33msegmentation, or object detection.[0m
[33mLet's go back in time a bit.[0m
[33mBack in the 1960s, we got our first set of neural networks.[0m

[33mThe first version of neural networks were simple.[0m
[33mThey were modeled as layers of neurons[0m
[33min which each layer was fully connected[0m
[33mto the one coming before and after it.[0m
[33mAs machine learning progressed,[0m
[33mwe learned that modeling neural networks in different ways[0m
[33mgave better results for different types of data.[0m
[33mWhen it comes to vision data,[0m
[33mwe found that this technique called a convolution[0m
[33mwas helpful in getting local context[0m
[33mand getting machines to decipher images.[0m

[33mIn [0m[1;33m1993[0m[33m, the first paper to use max pooling,[0m
[33ma way to collect the output[0m
[33mof convolution layers was published.[0m
[33mThis was the most common type of vision model[0m
[33mfor nearly [0m[1;33m30[0m[33m years.[0m
[33mThen in [0m[1;33m2019[0m[33m, [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m year after the original transformers paper,[0m
[33ma paper that was on how to use[0m
[33mtransformer models for language,[0m
[33ma new paper on vision transformers came out.[0m
[33mVision transformers took the attention mechanism[0m
[33mintroduced in the original transformers paper[0m
[33mand applied it to computer vision.[0m

[33mSo what is a convolutional neural network?[0m
[33mThe defining architecture of convolutional neural networks[0m
[33mis the combination of a convolutional layer[0m
[33mand a pooling layer.[0m
[33mThese two layers help us get context[0m
[33mfrom different places in the image[0m
[33mand combine all these local contexts[0m
[33mto make sense of the image.[0m
[33mLet's take a look at what this looks like visually.[0m
[33mImagine you have a 2D image filled with numbers[0m
[33mlike the one shown here.[0m

[33mThis picture shows how a convolution might work.[0m
[33mIn this case, we are looking at[0m
[33ma three by three convolution.[0m
[33mEach convolution has a filter,[0m
[33mand this filter is learnable,[0m
[33mas in it will change depending on how you train the model.[0m
[33mThe top part of the image shows the result of a convolution,[0m
[33mand the bottom part shows how it's done.[0m
[33mYou take the value of each entry in a convolution[0m
[33mand multiply it element wise with each value in the filter.[0m

[33mThen you add up all of the values in the resulting square[0m
[33mand use that as the result for the square[0m
[33mthat the convolution is based around in the resulting image.[0m
[33mSo that's a convolution and this is pooling.[0m
[33mMax pooling is a bit less complicated than a convolution.[0m
[33mAs shown in the image, all you need to do[0m
[33mis take the max of a value in a pool[0m
[33mand use that to represent the entire region.[0m
[33mIn the red region, we have [0m[1;33m12[0m[33m, [0m[1;33m20[0m[33m, [0m[1;33m8[0m[33m, and [0m[1;33m12[0m[33m.[0m

[33mSo we take [0m[1;33m20[0m[33m as the value to represent that region.[0m
[33mToday's vision model zeitgeist is vision transformers,[0m
[33mderived from the classic transformer model[0m
[33mof using an encoder, a decoder,[0m
[33mand an attention mechanism on an input sequence,[0m
[33mvision transformers takes the inspiration[0m
[33mdrawn from language and applies it to computer vision.[0m
[33mMuch like the idea of convolutional filters,[0m
[33mvision transformers operate in patches.[0m

[33mThese patches are N by N squares[0m
[33mthat each make up a piece of the image.[0m
[33mEach of these patches are turned into embeddings,[0m
[33mas we talked about earlier in the course.[0m
[33mThen these embeddings are put together into the encoder[0m
[33mand mixed with the intention mechanism[0m
[33mas they are fed into the decoder.[0m
[33mHere we see an illustration of how vision transformers work.[0m
[33mIn the bottom left, we see an image split into nine patches.[0m

[33mWe take these nine patches[0m
[33mand turn them into patch embeddings.[0m
[33mThese patch embeddings, often combined with a class token,[0m
[33mdenoted CLS in the diagram,[0m
[33mare then combined with a positional encoding[0m
[33mand fed into the transformer.[0m
[33mThe output is then fed into a multilayer perceptron,[0m
[33malso known as a fully connected neural network,[0m
[33mdenoted as the MLP head in the image,[0m
[33mand out comes logits that describe the image,[0m
[33mtypically some object detection or segmentation type task.[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Let's begin by exploring[0m
[33mthe answer to this question,[0m
[33mwhat is multimodality?[0m
[33mThe core idea behind multimodal AI applications[0m
[33mis that they deal with multiple types of data.[0m
[33mThere's a lot of buzz[0m
[33maround the term, multimodal, AI right now,[0m
[33mbut what does it really mean?[0m
[33mLet's take a look from the bottom up.[0m
[33mThe word multimodal comes from multi and modal.[0m

[33mMulti meaning many and modal meaning types.[0m
[33mThe reason why multimodal AI is so popular right now[0m
[33mis because it gives AI more human-like power.[0m
[33mHumans have a multimodal interface with the world.[0m
[33mThink of the senses.[0m
[33mWe have sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell.[0m
[33mWhen it comes to AI, the two modalities[0m
[33mthat are being emulated the most are closest[0m
[33mto sight and hearing.[0m

[33mWhile the term, multimodal, is still a highly debated term,[0m
[33msome examples of multimodality[0m
[33mcan be classically agreed upon by the industry.[0m
[33mThese examples include images and text,[0m
[33mimages and audio, and video.[0m
[33mNotice that these correspond[0m
[33mto the sense I mentioned earlier.[0m
[33mSight and sound.[0m
[33mImages and texts might both be related to sight,[0m
[33mbut machines process these as two different kinds of data.[0m

[33mWhile some examples of multimodal data are easier[0m
[33mto relate to the idea of human senses,[0m
[33mother more contested examples may not be as easy to relate[0m
[33mto the idea of human senses.[0m
[33mHere are three other examples that fall[0m
[33minto what may be referred to as multimodal.[0m
[33mPDFs and CSVs, texts and tables,[0m
[33mand tables and graphs.[0m
[33mThese examples all fall into the same category[0m
[33mfor human senses, sight.[0m

[33mHowever, the way they're structured[0m
[33mmeans they need to be input into machines[0m
[33min a different way.[0m
[33mDifferent machine learning models need to be trained[0m
[33mto handle each of these different types of data,[0m
[33mand that's why you may occasionally see combinations[0m
[33mof data types like these referred to as multimodal data.[0m

[33m### Ways to do multimodal RAG[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Let's look at some ways[0m
[33mwe can do multimodal RAG.[0m
[33mThe basic idea behind multimodal RAG[0m
[33mis the same as the basic idea behind multimodal data.[0m
[33mSo there's two main ways to do multimodal RAG.[0m
[33mOne, we can use one multimodal model[0m
[33mthat can handle multiple types of data.[0m
[33mTwo, we can use multiple models,[0m
[33musually one for each type of data that we want to work with.[0m
[33mLet's look at how the ways to do multimodal RAG breakdown.[0m

[33mWe can use one multimodal embedding model.[0m
[33mThis will be a model[0m
[33mthat can process multiple types of data,[0m
[33musually images and text.[0m
[33mWe can use multiple embedding models[0m
[33mand multiple search modes.[0m
[33mThese will be models for different types of data,[0m
[33mand we'll need to route each type of data to the right model[0m
[33mfor storing the data and searching the data.[0m
[33mThird, we can just do a combination of the two ways[0m
[33mto do multimodal RAG[0m
[33mand use multiple multimodal models.[0m

[33mWhile this is totally acceptable to do,[0m
[33mthis is extremely uncommon.[0m
[33mThe canonical way to build a multimodal RAG application[0m
[33mis to use a single multimodal model.[0m
[33mAs we talked about before,[0m
[33mmultimodal models are models[0m
[33mthat can handle different types of data.[0m
[33mThis style of building multimodal RAG[0m
[33mhas a couple nice advantages.[0m
[33mOne, you only need one vector store.[0m
[33mTwo, you only need one embedding model.[0m

[33mSince you're using the same model,[0m
[33meach embedding the model produces[0m
[33mwill have the same dimensionality,[0m
[33mso you can compare embeddings of images and text[0m
[33mor whatever types of data you're embedding directly.[0m
[33mIf you're building multimodal RAG natively in this way,[0m
[33myou have to call models differently[0m
[33mfor each data type that you're dealing with.[0m
[33mFor example, CLIP will have image and text options.[0m
[33mHowever, if you use a framework[0m
[33mlike LangChain or LlamaIndex,[0m
[33mthey will typically handle that for you.[0m

[33mThe other way to build multimodal RAG applications[0m
[33mis to use multiple models.[0m
[33mIn this case, you would need one model for each data type,[0m
[33myou would also need a separate vector store[0m
[33mfor each model that you use to create embeddings.[0m
[33mRemember that only vectors of the same size can be compared.[0m
[33mAnd since these vector embeddings[0m
[33mare generated by different models,[0m
[33mit's not likely they'll be the same length.[0m
[33mEven if they are,[0m
[33mit doesn't make sense to compare them[0m
[33mbecause they have different training contexts.[0m

[33mInstead of calling different encoding methods[0m
[33mof a single model to get vector embeddings,[0m
[33mwe would route data to different models[0m
[33mand route the resulting embeddings[0m
[33mto a different vector store depending on its vector type.[0m
[33mEven with most frameworks today,[0m
[33mthis is a manual process[0m
[33mbecause this method of doing multimodal RAG[0m
[33mis extremely uncommon.[0m
[33mThe final combination method to do multimodal RAG[0m
[33mis a spin on the first two methods.[0m
[33mIt's using multiple multimodal models.[0m

[33mAlmost no one uses this method in practice,[0m
[33mso why would you use this?[0m
[33mThere's two main reasons to use a setup like this.[0m
[33mThe first is if you just have[0m
[33mso many different types of data,[0m
[33mthe one multimodal model won't work for you.[0m
[33mMaybe you have video, audio, images,[0m
[33mtable data, and so on and so on.[0m
[33mThe second reason is if you want to re-rank[0m
[33myour vector results,[0m
[33mif you want to use models trained on multiple types[0m
[33mof different data to effectively get a second opinion.[0m

[33mTo build this kind of multimodal RAG model,[0m
[33myou would route data to different models[0m
[33mand vector stores based on their data type.[0m
[33mAnd if you have multiple models[0m
[33mhandling the same data type for re-ranking,[0m
[33myou would route them based on some sort of tagging system.[0m

[33m### Introduction to multimodal embedding models[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Let's understand multimodal embedding models.[0m
[33mThe main highlight of multimodal embedding models is simple.[0m
[33mThey can embed multiple types of data.[0m
[33mTypically, multimodal embedding models[0m
[33mwill have different functions internally[0m
[33mto embed each type of data.[0m
[33mThis is because embedding each type of data[0m
[33mis a different process in and of itself.[0m
[33mSometimes, data requires pre-processing.[0m

[33mOften, different parts of the model[0m
[33mare trained on and for different types of data.[0m
[33mThe most common practice[0m
[33mfor training multimodal embedding models[0m
[33mis to train them on pairs of data.[0m
[33mImages plus text is the most common pairing of data[0m
[33mto train these types of models on.[0m
[33mSome examples of multimodal embedding models include[0m
[33mCLIP from OpenAI,[0m
[33mlarge language models themselves[0m
[33mthat have evolved to become multimodal,[0m
[33msuch as GPT-4o, also from OpenAI,[0m
[33mand LLaVa,[0m
[33ma state-of-the-art end-to-end large transformer model[0m
[33mthat combines an image encoder in Vicuna, an LLM.[0m

[33mThis model is not from OpenAI.[0m
[33mIn this chapter, we cover CLIP and GPT-4o,[0m
[33mand we use CLIP for embedding[0m
[33mbecause it's free and open source.[0m
[33mCLIP stands for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining.[0m
[33mThe CLIP model has two encoders,[0m
[33mone for encoding images[0m
[33mand one for encoding language or text.[0m
[33mSince this is an open source model,[0m
[33mpublicly available on Hugging Face[0m
[33mand is also state of the art,[0m
[33mthis model is the most popular[0m
[33mmultimodal embedding model to date.[0m

[33mLet's briefly understand how CLIP works[0m
[33mand what the letters mean.[0m
[33mC, contrastive.[0m
[33mThere are many machine learning methods[0m
[33mfor aligning two modalities.[0m
[33mContrastive learning is one of the most powerful[0m
[33mand popular approaches to date.[0m
[33mThis technique takes pairs of data[0m
[33min the same embedding space[0m
[33mand trains both encoders to represent the pairs[0m
[33mas closely as possible.[0m
[33mAt the same time,[0m
[33mthe model is also incentivized[0m
[33mto represent unpaired image/text combos as far as possible.[0m

[33mL-I, language-image.[0m
[33mThe CLIP model takes both text and image as input,[0m
[33mand as we talked about earlier,[0m
[33mit has a different encoder for each.[0m
[33mOne point of importance to note here, though,[0m
[33mis that although the encoders are separate,[0m
[33mthey're still both in the same embedding space[0m
[33mand the vectors have the same dimensionality.[0m
[33mPretraining, P.[0m
[33mThe model is pretrained on [0m[1;33m400[0m[33m million pairs[0m
[33mof image and text data from the internet.[0m

[33mNow that we have an understanding[0m
[33mof multimodal embedding models,[0m
[33mlet's dive into the code.[0m

[33m### Demo: Embedding and storing data[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m The code in this video[0m
[33mshould be very familiar.[0m
[33mThis is the exact same code[0m
[33mthat we ran through in chapter [0m[1;33m2[0m
[33mto embed and store our images there.[0m
[33mLet's briefly review.[0m
[33mWe're using langchain to get our OpenCLIPEmbeddings[0m
[33mand storing all of our vectors into FAISS.[0m
[33mWhat we're doing here is we're grabbing all of these images,[0m
[33mencoding them into a Base64 encoding for the LLM,[0m
[33mcreating documents from all of these images,[0m
[33mand then using the OpenCLIPEmbeddings[0m
[33malong with all the documents[0m
[33mto store into the FAISS vector database.[0m


[33m### Demo: Query images with text[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m We're going to pick up right where we left off.[0m
[33mSo, with our vectors already stored,[0m
[33mthe first thing we do is create a retriever object[0m
[33mout of the vector store.[0m
[33mThis part should be familiar.[0m
[33mThis next part will not be as familiar.[0m
[33mWe need two more imports here, BytesIO and Images.[0m
[33mThese are for handling byte data and image data.[0m
[33mIn this code block, we create three functions,[0m
[33ma resizing function to feed the data into OpenAI,[0m
[33ma function to check if you're in Base64,[0m
[33ma function to check if the string is in Base64[0m
[33mand a function to split image and text input.[0m

[33mThe resizing function takes an input[0m
[33min the form of a Base64 string,[0m
[33mand it uses the image and BytesIO library[0m
[33mto open that string as an image, resizes the image,[0m
[33msaves the resized image[0m
[33mand returns that as a Base64-encoded string again.[0m
[33mThe next function simply checks[0m
[33mif you have a Base64 string.[0m
[33mThe third function takes your series of docs.[0m
[33mThe next function takes your input documents,[0m
[33mchecks if you are using an image or a text[0m
[33mand splits the data appropriately.[0m

[33mThe next code block serves to create the prompt[0m
[33mfor our multimodal RAG app.[0m
[33mWe have five imports in this section,[0m
[33mof which three we have not seen before.[0m
[33mHumanMessage, this is the type of message[0m
[33mthat you would expect from a human input.[0m
[33mRunnableLambda, which is just like RunnablePassThrough,[0m
[33mbut it's a function,[0m
[33mand ChatOpenAI, which is a way to access an OpenAI model[0m
[33mas a chat model.[0m

[33mWe need to make one function here.[0m
[33mThis function takes a data dictionary,[0m
[33mand this data dictionary comes from[0m
[33mthis last function that we made up here.[0m
[33mIt takes that dictionary and it splits the image[0m
[33mand text data and formats them into prompts[0m
[33mbefore we turn that into a set of human messages[0m
[33mto feed the LLM.[0m
[33mNext, we get our foundational model,[0m
[33mand the foundational model that we're using is GPT-4o mini,[0m
[33mand then we create a chain.[0m

[33mThis chain is much like the chain we've created before,[0m
[33mexcept instead of using a RunnablePassThrough string[0m
[33mfor everything, we use a RunnableLambda to get our context.[0m
[33mNext, we will invoke the chain,[0m
[33mand we'll ask it to look for a rottweiler in the images.[0m
[33mIt returns an image that the LLM describes[0m
[33mas featuring a rottweiler,[0m
[33mand if we look in our docs[0m
[33mand we retrieve for the text rottweiler,[0m
[33mwe see that the top result is dog_5,[0m
[33mand dog_5 is indeed a rottweiler.[0m


[33m### Challenge: Find anomalies in your embeddings[0m

[1;33m([0m[33mlively music[0m[1;33m)[0m
[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Now that we've seen how to build[0m
[33ma multimodal RAG application[0m
[33mby taking the images encoding the images,[0m
[33mstoring them into a vector database[0m
[33mand using text with prompts[0m
[33mto get an image back and a description of the image back,[0m
[33mlet's see if we can't find some anomalies[0m
[33min the data as well.[0m

[33mWhen it comes to data,[0m
[33myou've probably heard the phrase[0m
[33mgarbage in, garbage out multiple times.[0m
[33mIn this case, I challenge you to look through[0m
[33mthe vector database using the retriever[0m
[33mand see where the text and the images may not match up.[0m
[33mNote that this will not be just a case[0m
[33mof where the text and the images don't match,[0m
[33mbut also a function of the open clip model itself[0m
[33mand the data that it was trained on.[0m
[33mAnd if you find anomalies,[0m
[33mthere are three things you can do for the anomalies.[0m

[33mYou can fine tune the embedding model,[0m
[33mensure the data of good quality is of good quality,[0m
[33mand use rerankers[0m
[33mafter you retrieve all of your results.[0m
[33mHere's a tip for this challenge.[0m
[33mWhile you can execute the whole RAG chain,[0m
[33myou can also do this section without the LM at all.[0m
[33mGood luck and see you in the solution video.[0m

[33m### Solution: Find anomalies in your embeddings[0m

[1;33m([0m[33mupbeat music[0m[1;33m)[0m
[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m All right, welcome to the solution piece.[0m
[33mThere are quite a few anomalies that you can find.[0m
[33mHere, we're going to see two of them.[0m
[33mThe solution I chose to go with was[0m
[33mto take the vector database in its retriever format[0m
[33mand just use that directly, bypassing the LLM.[0m
[33mSo let's look at four examples.[0m
[33mTwo that show good data quality[0m
[33mand two that show an anomaly.[0m

[33mSo we have this example from[0m
[33mbefore where we saw the Rottweiler,[0m
[33mwhich is dog number five.[0m
[33mAnd that is correct.[0m
[33mHere, let's also search with an image.[0m
[33mSo if we encode the image of the cat, we should get cat_1[0m
[33mand we see that we do get cat_1 back[0m
[33mhere as the top results.[0m
[33mNow let's look for a gray cat with long hair in a field.[0m
[33mSo that's this cat, that's cat_2.[0m

[33mAnd when we run this, we actually see[0m
[33mthat dog_5, the Rottweiler, is actually the top results.[0m
[33mAnd we probably need to get a different embedding model[0m
[33mor fine tune our embedding model[0m
[33min order to get the right result here.[0m
[33mHere, we see golden retriever[0m
[33mplaying with an orange ball.[0m
[33mThat's this dog here, dog_2.[0m
[33mAnd we see that our top result is indeed dog_2.[0m
[33mAnd this example, we have golden retriever in a field[0m
[33mwith a sunny blurred background, which is dog number four,[0m
[33mgolden retriever in a field, sunny blurred background.[0m

[33mAnd that actually gives us cat_3,[0m
[33ma gray cat on a laptop as our top result.[0m
[33mOnce again, we see that dog_4 is not in the results,[0m
[33mjust like with cat_2.[0m
[33mSo we probably need to fine tune[0m
[33mor replace our embedding model.[0m

[33m## Introduction[0m

[33m### RAG with vector databases: Advanced strategies for AI optimization[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mYujian[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Before you know it,[0m
[33mevery developer will be working[0m
[33mwith some sort of AI product.[0m
[33mGet ahead of the curve by understanding not just how to work[0m
[33mwith an AI product,[0m
[33mbut understanding how to build AI products.[0m
[33mI've built hundreds of RAG applications[0m
[33mand I'm distilling what I've learned about[0m
[33moptimizing RAG apps[0m
[33mand passing that knowledge onto you.[0m
[33mMy name is Yujian Tang[0m
[33mand I've helped thousands of developers understand, use,[0m
[33mand contribute to the development and direction of AI.[0m
[33mSo if you are ready to master RAG,[0m
[33myou've come to the right place.[0m

[33mLet's jump in.[0m

[33m### What you should know[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructror[0m[1;33m][0m[33m This course assumes you have[0m
[33ma conceptual understanding of vector databases,[0m
[33membedding models, and large language models.[0m
[33mI also assume you understand the fundamentals[0m
[33mof how to write Python code.[0m
[33mBefore we dive into the course,[0m
[33mlet's review some of these topics[0m
[33mand how they're related to what we're about to learn here.[0m
[33mWe'll start with vector databases.[0m
[33mA vector database is a tool[0m
[33mthat helps you work with unstructured data[0m
[33min the form of vectors.[0m

[33mFun fact, the name vector database is actually a misnomer.[0m
[33mVector databases are not real databases,[0m
[33mbut rather compute engines for vector data.[0m
[33mVector data is often referred to as a vector embedding[0m
[33min the context of Generative AI.[0m
[33mAnd for the purpose of retrieval augmented generation,[0m
[33mwe will refer to vectors and embeddings as the same thing.[0m
[33mThese vectors are long series of numbers,[0m
[33mtypically hundreds or thousands of numbers.[0m
[33mThe reason we call them vector embeddings[0m
[33mis because they're generated by deep neural networks.[0m

[33mThey come from the second to last layer[0m
[33mof the neural network.[0m
[33mThat layer's output contains all of the information[0m
[33mthe network has learned[0m
[33mwithout applying the predictive layer.[0m
[33mThese deep neural networks[0m
[33mare what we refer to as embedding models.[0m
[33mEmbedding models can come in all sorts[0m
[33mof different shapes and sizes,[0m
[33mas well as work on all sorts of different data types.[0m
[33mThere are two critical things you need to know[0m
[33mabout using embedding models and vectors.[0m
[33mOne, you need to match up the data type and the model type.[0m

[33mFor example, you can only use[0m
[33membedding models for images on image data[0m
[33mand embedding models for text on text data.[0m
[33mEven in multimodal models,[0m
[33mwhich can work on multiple types of data,[0m
[33myou must specify which type of input data[0m
[33mis being used to produce the bright embeddings.[0m
[33mTwo, you can only compare vectors of the same size.[0m
[33mThis means you need to use the same embedding models[0m
[33mfor vectorization of your input data[0m
[33mas well as during the retrieval step of your RAG app.[0m

[33mSo where do large language models come in?[0m
[33mIn the context of RAG,[0m
[33mLLMs are the interface for interacting with your data.[0m
[33mMost LLMs, including GPT-[0m[1;33m4[0m
[33mare based off of the transformer model.[0m
[33mThey predict what the most likely next token is,[0m
[33mgiven the current set of tokens.[0m
[33mPublicly available LLMs are trained on large data sets[0m
[33mof publicly available data.[0m
[33mThis means they don't have access to your data,[0m

[33m### Introduction to preprocessing for RAG[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Before we can get[0m
[33minto building a RAG app,[0m
[33mwe have to pre-process the data.[0m
[33mIn this section, we'll cover three critical components[0m
[33min data, pre-processing for retrieval augmented generation,[0m
[33mchunking, embeddings, and metadata.[0m
[33mChunking is the process of breaking down big blocks[0m
[33mof text into smaller blocks.[0m
[33mEmbeddings are the vectors that are generated[0m
[33mby embedding models.[0m
[33mThey represent the semantic meaning[0m
[33mof some input data in a quantifiable fashion.[0m

[33mMetadata is data that gets stored along with embeddings[0m
[33min vector databases.[0m
[33mIt is critical to building customizable RAG applications.[0m
[33mWhy do you need to chunk your data?[0m
[33mIf you think about the way[0m
[33mthat you process information[0m
[33mand overlay that to how machines work,[0m
[33myou should get an intuitive understanding of chunking.[0m
[33mAs humans, we read books or documents,[0m
[33mone sentence or paragraph at a time.[0m
[33mIn other words, we read things[0m
[33min semantically coherent chunks.[0m

[33mIf you were to try to grab an entire book,[0m
[33mit would be nearly impossible.[0m
[33mComputers, and in this context, LLMs,[0m
[33mwork the same way.[0m
[33mWhen working with LLMs you may have heard[0m
[33mof something called the context window.[0m
[33mThe context window of an LLM is the maximum number[0m
[33mof tokens, which you can think of, like words[0m
[33mthat an LLM can work with at once.[0m
[33mWhen an LLM has a context window of say, [0m[1;33m128[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m,[0m
[33mlike GPT-[0m[1;33m4[0m[33m Turbo, you can think to yourself[0m
[33mthis LLM can hold roughly [0m[1;33m128[0m[33m,[0m[1;33m000[0m[33m words[0m
[33min short-term memory.[0m

[33mThe context window is really just a cap.[0m
[33mIt doesn't represent what the ideal number of words[0m
[33mor tokens a model can work with is,[0m
[33mand how does this relate to chunking?[0m
[33mThis gives us a framework to start thinking[0m
[33mabout how we should chunk our data.[0m
[33mThe other piece of the puzzle is the type[0m
[33mof data that we have.[0m
[33mDifferent types of data[0m
[33mrequire different chunking strategies and approaches.[0m
[33mWe'll dive deeper into the world[0m
[33mof chunking in a later video.[0m
[33mAs we briefly mentioned in our overview[0m
[33mof prior knowledge,[0m
[33membeddings or embedding vectors[0m
[33mare just a series of numbers[0m
[33mthat represent some input data.[0m

[33mEmbeddings can be used to represent all sorts[0m
[33mof input data from text to images or video and even DNA.[0m
[33mThe important thing to remember about embeddings is[0m
[33mthat they give us a way to use vector databases[0m
[33mto compare data that we couldn't compare before.[0m
[33mThere are two main types of embeddings,[0m
[33mdense embeddings and sparse embeddings.[0m
[33mDense embeddings are embedding vectors[0m
[33mwhere only a few of the values are zero,[0m
[33mand dense embeddings are by and large created[0m
[33mby machine learning models.[0m

[33mSparse embeddings are embedding vectors[0m
[33mwhere many of the values are zero.[0m
[33mA good rule of thumb is that when more than half[0m
[33mof the values in your vector embeddings are zeros,[0m
[33myou have a sparse embedding.[0m
[33mSparse embeddings are mostly created by algorithms.[0m
[33mFor the purpose of RAG,[0m
[33mwe'll mostly work with dense embeddings.[0m
[33mThe final piece in data pre-processing[0m
[33mfor RAG is the metadata.[0m
[33mMetadata is data[0m
[33mthat gets stored alongside your embeddings[0m
[33min a vector database.[0m

[33mYour metadata is critical[0m
[33mto optimizing your RAG application.[0m
[33mMetadata can include information[0m
[33mabout your data itself,[0m
[33mas well as information[0m
[33mabout how the specific data point relates[0m
[33mto the larger dataset.[0m
[33mWhen you are building a RAG application,[0m
[33myour metadata must include the text[0m
[33mthat you are vectorizing.[0m
[33mThe vector database retrieves similar data based[0m
[33mon the vector embeddings,[0m
[33mbut LLMs are not able[0m
[33mto directly convert vector embeddings into text.[0m

[33mThe relevant text must be included[0m
[33min the data point so that the LLM can read it.[0m
[33mOne of the main uses of metadata[0m
[33min a RAG application is[0m
[33mthat it's used to filter searches.[0m
[33mAs we talked about previously,[0m
[33mmetadata can be processing metadata[0m
[33mor metadata about the data itself.[0m
[33mExamples of processing metadata[0m
[33mcan include section title,[0m
[33mparagraph number, and chunk location.[0m
[33mExamples of data-related metadata[0m
[33mcan include the embedded data itself,[0m
[33mpublication date, and the author.[0m

[33mNow that we have an overview of the three pieces[0m
[33mof optimizing a RAG app,[0m
[33mchunking, embeddings, and metadata,[0m
[33mlet's dive deeper into how each of these pieces work.[0m

[33m### Chunking considerations[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m The first pre-processing step to discuss[0m
[33mis chunking.[0m
[33mChunking is how we make documents consumable[0m
[33mfor generative AI use cases like RAG.[0m
[33mChunking is the process of splitting up documents[0m
[33minto smaller chunks of text.[0m
[33mThese chunks need to be small enough[0m
[33mto be consumable, coherent and contextual,[0m
[33mso let's break that down.[0m
[33mWhat makes a chunk consumable?[0m
[33mFrom a technical perspective,[0m
[33ma consumable chunk must fit into the context window[0m
[33mof your chosen embedding model.[0m

[33mOn top of that, at least three of these chunks[0m
[33mmust fit into the context window of your chosen LLM.[0m
[33mThe number of these chunks that have to fit[0m
[33minto your LLM context window is dependent[0m
[33mon the top K you've chosen[0m
[33mfor your vector database retrieval,[0m
[33mwhich we'll touch more on embedding models[0m
[33mas well as top K for retrievals and vector databases later.[0m
[33mFrom a common sense perspective.[0m
[33mYou want to ensure that you can consume[0m
[33mor read your chunk in one go.[0m

[33mWhat makes a chunk coherent?[0m
[33mA coherent chunk is one that makes sense.[0m
[33mIf you read the chunk of text and it makes you go, [0m[33m"Huh,"[0m
[33mthat is not a coherent chunk of text.[0m
[33mFrom a technical perspective,[0m
[33myou want to ensure that your chunks don't start and stop[0m
[33min the middle of a word, clause, or sentence.[0m
[33mFrom a common sense perspective,[0m
[33myou want your chunks of text[0m
[33mto be sets of complete thoughts.[0m
[33mFor example, [0m[33m"Curiosity killed the cat"[0m[33m is a coherent chunk,[0m
[33m"killed the"[0m[33m is not.[0m

[33mThe last C of chunking is contextual.[0m
[33mWhat makes a chunk contextual?[0m
[33mThis one is a little different from the other two.[0m
[33mThe technical and common sense perspectives of contextual[0m
[33mare more or less the same thing.[0m
[33mThe idea behind contextual chunking[0m
[33mis that you get chunks of text[0m
[33mthat contain all the necessary context to answer a question.[0m
[33mFor example, [0m[33m"Curiosity killed the cat"[0m
[33mmay be a coherent chunk,[0m
[33mbut it is often taken out of context of the full saying,[0m
[33mand the full saying is "Curiosity killed the cat,[0m
[33mbut satisfaction brought it back."[0m
[33mIf you take things out of context,[0m
[33myou may not derive their full meaning.[0m

[33mAs Stewart Stafford said, "Separate texts from context[0m
[33mand all that remains is a con."[0m
[33mWhen it comes to chunking,[0m
[33mthere are three major considerations to take into account.[0m
[33mThese are the size of your chunks,[0m
[33mhow much chunks overlap with each other,[0m
[33mand whether or not we should use special characters[0m
[33mto mark where to split chunks.[0m
[33mChunk size is a pretty self-explanatory term.[0m
[33mThe chunk size refers the number of characters in a chunk.[0m

[33mPicking your chunk size is largely dependent[0m
[33mon the structure of your data,[0m
[33mand we'll look at some examples later.[0m
[33mFor reference, most paragraphs[0m
[33mare about [0m[1;33m100[0m[33m words or [0m[1;33m500[0m[33m characters,[0m
[33mand that's a good place to start for your chunk size.[0m
[33mDepending on which method you use to chunk your data,[0m
[33myour chunk size may be used as a hard limit[0m
[33mor just a guideline, more on this later.[0m
[33mMuch like chunk size,[0m
[33mchunk overlap is a relatively self-explanatory term.[0m

[33mChunk overlap refers to the number of characters repeated[0m
[33mbetween consecutive chunks.[0m
[33mWhy would you want to have overlapping sections[0m
[33mbetween different chunks of data?[0m
[33mThere's two ways to think about how this helps.[0m
[33mFirst, you can think about chunk overlap[0m
[33mas the way to preserve context between chunks.[0m
[33mIf you have the last sentence or paragraph[0m
[33mof the chunk before,[0m
[33myou have extra context into the current chunk.[0m

[33mSecond, you can think about it as a tool[0m
[33mto help reinforce the guidelines[0m
[33mof chunks being consumable, coherent, and contextual.[0m
[33mSpecial characters.[0m
[33mUnfortunately, there is no industry standard[0m
[33mon what these are called and how these are referenced,[0m
[33mand I couldn't really come up with a better name.[0m
[33mBut these are characters[0m
[33mthat you want to split your text up on.[0m
[33mThese can be used in conjunction with chunk size[0m
[33mand chunk overlap to allow you to relax restrictions[0m
[33maround chunk size and overlap[0m
[33mto create more coherent chunks.[0m

[33mFor example, let's say you want to ensure[0m
[33mall your splits are in complete sentences,[0m
[33mbut your chunk sizing the number of characters per chunk[0m
[33mdoesn't always end on a complete sentence.[0m
[33mWhat do you do?[0m
[33mYou can use special characters to relax this restriction[0m
[33mby allowing your chunks to go oversize[0m
[33mand end at the next period,[0m
[33mdouble new line, single new line,[0m
[33mor any other special character that you want.[0m


[33m### Chunking examples[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Let's look at some examples[0m
[33mof types of texts you may chunk.[0m
[33mThere are many types of documents[0m
[33mthat you'll face as you build[0m
[33mretrieval augmented generation apps in production.[0m
[33mLet's take a look at three common types of documents[0m
[33mand how to chunk them.[0m
[33mFirst, we'll look at document data.[0m
[33mThis is the type of data that[0m
[33myou would typically think of as a document,[0m
[33mthings like research papers, books, or perhaps blogs.[0m
[33mSecond, question answered transcripts.[0m

[33mAn example of a Q/A transcript would be something like[0m
[33man AMA that you find on Reddit.[0m
[33mYou'll need to keep the questions and answers coupled,[0m
[33mas well as make sure they are in separate chunks.[0m
[33mThird, chat transcripts.[0m
[33mLet's start with document style data.[0m
[33mDocument data is probably the most widely used form of data[0m
[33mfor information retrieval.[0m
[33mThis style of data includes things[0m
[33mlike papers, reports, and documentation.[0m

[33mExamples of papers include the research publications[0m
[33mthat you find on archive,[0m
[33man essay from a writer that you like,[0m
[33mor a blog post that you may have on your website.[0m
[33mExamples of reports include things[0m
[33mlike the report that you write for your boss,[0m
[33mthe news article about the latest news,[0m
[33mor a lab report a student writes for class.[0m
[33mExamples of documentation[0m
[33minclude things like the write-up about the latest project[0m
[33myour software engineering team is supposed to make,[0m
[33ma guide on how to use some machinery,[0m
[33mor API docs for how to use an open source library.[0m

[33mOne of the defining features of document data[0m
[33mis that the text is usually organized[0m
[33min regularly sized blocks.[0m
[33mYou typically won't find too much variation[0m
[33min the size of a semantically coherent chunk of text[0m
[33mwithin these documents.[0m
[33mThis type of text data lends itself[0m
[33mto easier chunk sizing and chunk overlap choice.[0m
[33mTypically, you won't even have to worry too much[0m
[33mabout splitting on special characters,[0m
[33mmost of the time you can just split on double new lines.[0m

[33mQ/A transcripts can be from things[0m
[33mlike podcasts, classes, and talks.[0m
[33mThese transcripts can be pulled from things[0m
[33mlike your favorite podcast,[0m
[33mthe lecture you were supposed to attend[0m
[33mthat you slept through,[0m
[33mor the Tech Talks by OSS for AI[0m
[33mthat you wish you were able to make.[0m
[33mThe defining features of Q/A transcripts[0m
[33mis that they typically have these short-long snippets.[0m
[33mUsually, the question asked is short[0m
[33mand the answer is longer.[0m

[33mOf course, sometimes, that won't be the case,[0m
[33mbut most of the time, it will be.[0m
[33mThe other defining characteristic[0m
[33mis that Q/A transcripts typically have[0m
[33msemantically linked chunks.[0m
[33mA question and an answer[0m
[33mare semantically linked to each other.[0m
[33mUsually, the answer doesn't make sense[0m
[33mwithout linking to the question.[0m
[33mThis lends itself to two styles[0m
[33mthat are actually more important to metadata than chunking[0m
[33mthat we'll touch on later,[0m
[33mbut the basic idea is that[0m
[33myou can store metadata of different chunks[0m
[33mto remind the program that they're linked.[0m

[33mExamples of chat transcripts[0m
[33minclude customer support, texts and DMs.[0m
[33mYou may get these transcripts[0m
[33mfrom things like your phone call[0m
[33mor instant messaging with text support[0m
[33mfor your cell phone coverage provider,[0m
[33mtexts between you and a friend or group chat,[0m
[33mand DMs on LinkedIn.[0m
[33mThe defining feature of chat transcripts[0m
[33mis irregularly sized chunks and unpredictable linking.[0m
[33mUnlike Q/A transcripts,[0m
[33myou can't use a rule like answers usually follow questions.[0m

[33mSometimes you have the same person[0m
[33msending multiple messages in a row,[0m
[33mand these messages are rarely the same size.[0m
[33mUnlike document data,[0m
[33myou can't rely on regularly sized data,[0m
[33mand sometimes messages are a sentence,[0m
[33msometimes a word, sometimes a paragraph.[0m
[33mIn chat transcripts,[0m
[33mspecial characters are especially important.[0m
[33mThis is where you really need something[0m
[33mthat separates each message[0m
[33min some way to see who wrote that message.[0m
[33mOnce again, something to be covered in metadata.[0m

[33mAs such, there are now hundreds[0m
[33mof embedding models specifically for text.[0m
[33mYou can find a list of these models[0m
[33mon the Hugging Face MTEB[0m
[33mMassive Text Embedding Benchmark's leaderboard.[0m
[33mThat's MTEB, M-T-E-B.[0m
[33mIf you're working in an extremely specialized domain though,[0m
[33meven MTEB is not a comprehensive list.[0m
[33mFor example,[0m
[33mCSV documents require their own embedding models.[0m

[33mAnd if you think about it,[0m
[33mthe way the CSVs are set up is extremely different[0m
[33mfrom the way that regular text is set up.[0m
[33mIn CSVs, commas are used to separate entries or entities.[0m
[33mIn regular text,[0m
[33mcommas are used to signal a pause in thought[0m
[33mor to separate phrases, clauses, or positives.[0m
[33mWhen it comes to embedding your text for later use,[0m
[33mthere are many things to think about,[0m
[33mbut if you take care of these three,[0m
[33mthe rest often fall into line.[0m

[33mThe three critical considerations in embedding your data[0m
[33mis the embedding model itself,[0m
[33mwhat you want to embed,[0m
[33mand how to compare your embeddings.[0m
[33mLet's look at the three pieces of picking the right model.[0m
[33mThe three pieces that go into picking an embedding model[0m
[33mare embedding size, model size, and training data.[0m
[33mFirst, embedding size.[0m
[33mEmbedding size is the size of the embedding vector.[0m
[33mThis is also referred to as the length[0m
[33mor the dimensionality of the vector.[0m

[33mRemember that vectors are just lists of numbers.[0m
[33mThese vectors are typically produced[0m
[33mby a deep neural network.[0m
[33mThey're the output[0m
[33mof the second to last layer of the network.[0m
[33mWhen you put data into an neural net,[0m
[33meach layer learns something about the data,[0m
[33mand the final layer takes that information[0m
[33mand makes a prediction or classification.[0m
[33mThe second to last layer contains all of the information[0m
[33mwithout making a prediction on it.[0m
[33mThe size of the embedding affects the computational power[0m
[33mneeded to compare vectors when you use them.[0m

[33mIt is critical to remember here[0m
[33mthat only embeddings of the same size can be compared.[0m
[33mSecond, model size.[0m
[33mMuch like the size of embeddings,[0m
[33mthe size of the model you choose[0m
[33malso has an effect on computational power.[0m
[33mSmaller embedding models are less expensive overall.[0m
[33mThey're less expensive to use both to create embeddings[0m
[33mand once you have the embeddings.[0m
[33mMeanwhile, larger models[0m
[33mcan give you more fine-grained results,[0m
[33mwhich may be necessary depending on what you're doing.[0m

[33mOne last thing to remember[0m
[33mis that embedding models are not always LLMs.[0m
[33mWhile LLMs can be used as embedding models,[0m
[33mthese are not the same thing.[0m
[33mThird is training data.[0m
[33mThe data that your model is trained on is always important.[0m
[33mDifferent models on the MTEB leaderboard[0m
[33mare trained on different datasets.[0m
[33mExamples of how the data[0m
[33mand the training set can change your model[0m
[33minclude language, structure, and data size.[0m

[33mFor example, models trained on Chinese[0m
[33mcan help you embed data in Chinese,[0m
[33mbut probably not Arabic.[0m
[33mModels trained on chat style data[0m
[33mare better for embedding conversational input[0m
[33mthan for embedding essays.[0m
[33mLet's also look at algorithmic models.[0m
[33mThese are a special case[0m
[33mand these are not neural nets.[0m
[33mThese are algorithms[0m
[33mand typically produce a different type of embedding.[0m
[33mExamples can include TF-IDF,[0m
[33mterm frequency inverse document frequency,[0m
[33mSPLADE, sparse lexical and expansion models,[0m
[33mand BM25, where BM stands for best matching.[0m

[33mThese algorithms produce binary or sparse embeddings,[0m
[33mas we talked about before.[0m
[33mMeasuring the similarity between these models[0m
[33mis also different than the others,[0m
[33mbut we'll talk about that later.[0m
[33mWhen it comes to picking what you want to embed,[0m
[33mthere are three main options.[0m
[33mYou can embed the chunked text,[0m
[33myou can embed a portion of the chunk's text,[0m
[33mor you can embed the larger chunk[0m
[33mor section that your chunk text is part of.[0m

[33mAt this point, a question naturally arises.[0m
[33mIf I spent so much time making my chunks good,[0m
[33mwhy would I not just embed them?[0m
[33mOnce again, because we are working[0m
[33mwith programmatic methods,[0m
[33mthese techniques are there[0m
[33mto enhance your chunking methods.[0m
[33mLarge to small refers to a technique[0m
[33mwhere you embed large paragraphs,[0m
[33mbut store individual senses as the metadata.[0m
[33mAnd small to large refers to a technique[0m
[33mwhere you embed individual sentences[0m
[33mbut store the large paragraph in the metadata.[0m

[33mRemember that vectors are just long lists of numbers.[0m
[33mWhile there are many distance metrics[0m
[33mthat can be used to compare vectors,[0m
[33mthere are three main distance calculations,[0m
[33mcosine, inner product, and Euclidean.[0m
[33mEuclidean distance measures the spatial distance[0m
[33mbetween two vectors.[0m
[33mThe best way to imagine vectors for Euclidean distance[0m
[33mis to imagine the two points in hyperspace[0m
[33mthat the vectors point at,[0m
[33mand then imagine the distance between those two points.[0m

[33mThe formula for Euclidean distance[0m
[33mis the square root[0m
[33mof the sum of the difference between each entry.[0m
[33min the two vectors squared.[0m
[33mCosine similarity measures the difference[0m
[33min orientation of two vectors.[0m
[33mUnlike Euclidean distance,[0m
[33mcosine similarity has us think of the vectors[0m
[33mas arrows in hyperspace,[0m
[33mwhere we're measuring is the orientational difference[0m
[33mbetween the two arrows at the origin.[0m

[33mThis distance metric is the most complicated[0m
[33mand computationally expensive distance measure[0m
[33mfor dense vectors.[0m
[33mCosine similarity is the normalized dot product[0m
[33mof two vectors.[0m
[33mThe formula is the dot product of A and B[0m
[33mdivided by the magnitude of A times the magnitude of B.[0m
[33mAnother way to express it[0m
[33mis the sum of the product of each entry in the vectors[0m
[33mdivided by the product of the square roots[0m
[33mof the square of each term in each vector.[0m

[33mInner product or dot product[0m
[33mis the simplest of these three measures of similarity.[0m
[33mThe way to think about this measure[0m
[33mis to think about the vectors as arrows[0m
[33mand then think about the projection[0m
[33mof one vector onto another.[0m
[33mWe saw this formula earlier in the cosine similarity slide.[0m
[33mThe formula for inner product[0m
[33mis the sum of the product of each entry in the vectors.[0m
[33mThis is cosine similarity[0m
[33mwithout dividing by the product of the magnitudes.[0m

[33mSo for sparse or binary vectors,[0m
[33mthere are two distance metrics that we should know,[0m
[33mHamming distance and Jaccard distance.[0m
[33mHamming distance is measured as the number of points[0m
[33min which two binary vectors are different.[0m
[33mAnd Hamming distance can be measured[0m
[33mby first taking an XOR of two vectors[0m
[33mand then summing all of the 1s in the result.[0m
[33mThe other binary distance metric[0m
[33mthat's good to measure on is Jaccard distance.[0m

[33mJaccard distance is [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m minus the Jaccard similarity.[0m
[33mThe Jaccard similarity is the intersection of two vectors.[0m
[33mAnother way to calculate Jaccard distance[0m
[33mis the difference of the union of A and B[0m
[33mand the intersection of A and B[0m
[33mdivided by the union of A and B.[0m
[33mIf both vectors are [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m in an entry,[0m
[33mthen that counts as an intersection point.[0m
[33mIf either vector has a [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m,[0m
[33mthen that point can be included in the union of A and B.[0m

[33mA good way to think about Jaccard distance[0m
[33min terms of logical operators for vectors[0m
[33mis A or B[0m
[33mminus A and B total[0m
[33mdivided by A or B.[0m

[33m### Embedding examples[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mPresenter[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Let's look at some examples[0m
[33mof how you can embed data.[0m
[33mThere are many ways to embed[0m
[33mand there are many things that you can embed.[0m
[33mThe three primary methods we'll cover[0m
[33mfor embedding in this section are the basic embeddings,[0m
[33msmall to big, and big to small,[0m
[33mand we'll also briefly discuss non-English examples.[0m
[33mThe most basic method of embedding[0m
[33mis to just straight up embed the chunk.[0m
[33mSometimes this works for your most basic tasks.[0m

[33mHowever, when it comes to advanced RAG use cases[0m
[33mand putting things into production,[0m
[33myou're going to need something a little more involved.[0m
[33mSmall to big is a term coined by former LlamaIndex head[0m
[33mof TypeScript and Partnerships, Yi Ding,[0m
[33mand he coined it at one of my first events in San Francisco.[0m
[33mThe idea behind small to big is that you embed a sentence,[0m
[33mbut you store the whole paragraph as text.[0m

[33mWhy would you do this?[0m
[33mWell, it's good for increased context.[0m
[33mSome texts have very short sentences,[0m
[33mand it's helpful to retrieve not just the sentence[0m
[33mor the one sentence proceeding or following it,[0m
[33mbut the entire paragraph in which that sentence was used.[0m
[33mThis is another way to help ensure semantic coherence[0m
[33mlike we covered in chunking.[0m
[33mBig to small is the opposite of small to big.[0m

[33mInstead of embedding a sentence and storing a paragraph,[0m
[33mwe embed a paragraph and store a sentence.[0m
[33mWell, why would we do this?[0m
[33mSometimes sentences themselves don't always make sense,[0m
[33mand the tactics of chunking sentences[0m
[33mmay leave some sentences broken.[0m
[33mFor example, if we have a period following Mr.,[0m
[33mthen we may have a broken sentence.[0m
[33mEmbedding a whole paragraph[0m
[33mand retrieving all the sentences separately[0m
[33mlets us do some post-processing[0m
[33mbefore feeding the chunks to an LLM[0m
[33mto ensure that we get the right context.[0m

[33mFinally, we're looking at non-English embeddings.[0m
[33mHere's a special case.[0m
[33mIf you're not working with English data,[0m
[33myou'll need an embedding model[0m
[33mthat was trained on non-English data.[0m
[33mYou have a few options.[0m
[33mOne of the easiest, but perhaps the not the most efficient[0m
[33mor cost-effective methods,[0m
[33mis to use an LLM that has multiple language data.[0m
[33mExamples include GPT models beyond [0m[1;33m3.5[0m[33m, Mixtral, and Queen.[0m

[33mIf you're looking for a more compute-friendly option,[0m
[33myou can search the MTEB leaderboards[0m
[33mfor models in different languages[0m
[33msuch as French, Polish, Chinese, and more.[0m

[33m### Metadata[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Metadata is the final piece[0m
[33mof what makes vector databases useful.[0m
[33mWithout storing metadata,[0m
[33mwe would just be comparing a bunch of numbers.[0m
[33mThe term metadata encompasses all of the data[0m
[33mthat gets stored with your vector embeddings.[0m
[33mWhen it comes to retrieval, augmented generation,[0m
[33mwe definitely need to store the actual text[0m
[33mthat the vector embedding was generated from,[0m
[33mand we can also store many other types of metadata.[0m

[33mSo what is metadata?[0m
[33mOther than the text itself?[0m
[33mThere are many different types of metadata.[0m
[33mYou can think of metadata in many different ways.[0m
[33mIt's the data that isn't the embeddings[0m
[33mthat you store in your vector database.[0m
[33mA lot of this data falls into the category of data[0m
[33mthat gets stored in traditional databases,[0m
[33mand we'll cover more examples later in this video.[0m
[33mYou also need to remember that metadata is critical for RAG.[0m
[33mIt's not just critical for performing basic RAG[0m
[33mby providing the text and unvectorized data,[0m
[33mbut also critical for advanced usage like filtering.[0m

[33mI would split metadata into two general types,[0m
[33mchunking metadata and non chunking metadata.[0m
[33mThis categorization is based on where the metadata[0m
[33mis coming from.[0m
[33mChunking metadata is metadata that comes out[0m
[33mof the chunking process.[0m
[33mExamples of chunking metadata include the sentence number,[0m
[33mthe subtitle, or the section header.[0m
[33mYou can think about this type of metadata as the metadata[0m
[33mthat tells you where in the document the current chunk[0m
[33myou're working with comes from.[0m

[33mThe main usage for this metadata is context and filtering.[0m
[33mYou can use chunking metadata[0m
[33mto understand more about the context of a chunk,[0m
[33msuch as through the subtitles, as well as filter the chunks.[0m
[33mFor example, you may want chunks[0m
[33monly from a certain section.[0m
[33mThe other type of metadata is non-chunking metadata.[0m
[33mAll this means is that the metadata was not produced[0m
[33mnor tied to the chunking process.[0m

[33mExamples of non-chunking metadata include the author,[0m
[33mthe last time an entry was updated, or the document title.[0m
[33mThe main usage for non chunking metadata[0m
[33mis for filtering your search.[0m
[33mFor example, you may only want data that was written by you[0m
[33mor updated in the last month.[0m
[33mSo how can we store metadata?[0m
[33mAs we mentioned before, a lot of metadata,[0m
[33malmost all of the non-chunky metadata is metadata[0m
[33mthat was traditionally stored in a relational database.[0m

[33mSo one option is to link to where your metadata was stored.[0m
[33mAnother option that is more popular for RAG applications[0m
[33mis to store your metadata directly[0m
[33min the vector store itself.[0m
[33mIt's easier and faster to store your metadata directly[0m
[33mwith your vectors and use it for info[0m
[33mand filtering that way.[0m

[33m### Demo: Chunking[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m With our data ready,[0m
[33mwe can work on the first part[0m
[33mof our RAG application, chunking.[0m
[33mAs we mentioned earlier, chunking is the process[0m
[33mof breaking large texts up into small, workable pieces.[0m
[33mIn the first block here, we're going to import three things.[0m
[33mThe document object, the character text splitter object,[0m
[33mand the OS library.[0m
[33mThe document object is LangChain's native way[0m
[33mto store objects.[0m
[33mWe use this to add metadata to our text[0m
[33mand prepare it for the vector store.[0m

[33mThe character text splitter object is a LangChain object[0m
[33mthat can split strings up based on some preset parameters.[0m
[33mIn our case, we use it for determining chunk size[0m
[33mand chunk overlap.[0m
[33mThe third functional import is the OS library,[0m
[33mand we use this for navigating the directory structure[0m
[33mof the operating system.[0m
[33mNow for the functionality,[0m
[33mparsing and chunking the data.[0m
[33mFirst, we make sure that we're using the right folder.[0m
[33mIn this case, we are using the Big Star Collectibles folder.[0m

[33mTo access the list of text files within this folder,[0m
[33mwe use the OS library to get a list of the directory.[0m
[33mNext, we create an empty list object[0m
[33mto hold all of the chunked up texts[0m
[33mthat we're going to create,[0m
[33mthen we start looping through all of the files[0m
[33mand chunking them up.[0m
[33mSo, what do we do in this loop?[0m
[33mWe start by opening up our file and reading the entire page[0m
[33min as a single string.[0m
[33mNext, we create a CharacterTextSplitter object.[0m

[33mThis specific instance is set up[0m
[33mto split strings into [0m[1;33m128[0m[33m character chunks[0m
[33mwith [0m[1;33m32[0m[33m character overlaps,[0m
[33mthen we use the object's split_text function[0m
[33mand pass the string containing our entire file through[0m
[33mto get our chunks.[0m
[33mThe last bit of functionality in the chunking section[0m
[33mis to loop through each of these chunked texts[0m
[33mand create a document object from each chunk.[0m
[33mTo ensure that we keep the chunks[0m
[33mstored in our vector store,[0m
[33mwe assign it to the page_content parameter.[0m

[33mWhen you run the cell,[0m
[33myou may notice that some of these chunks[0m
[33mare larger than the specified chunk size of [0m[1;33m128[0m[33m,[0m
[33mand we'll address this in one of the challenges later on.[0m
[33mFinally, let's take one block of code[0m
[33mto just look at the chunk.[0m
[33mLooking at the first chunk,[0m
[33mwe can see the beginnings[0m
[33mof the Binaryville text file.[0m

[33mMetadata is stored as a dictionary.[0m

[33mYou can define the metadata that you want to store.[0m
[33mOne of the most common pieces of metadata to store[0m
[33mis the title of the document.[0m
[33mFor this example, we store this under doc title.[0m
[33mWe'll also store the chunk number.[0m
[33mThis tells us where in the document[0m

[33mOther than adding the metadata parameter[0m

[33mon top of our vector store is to add the LLM.[0m
[33mFor this part, you'll need access to an LLM.[0m
[33mYou can do this in the form of an API key[0m
[33mfrom OctoAI, OpenAI, or some other LLM provider.[0m
[33mAlternatively, you can run your own LLM locally.[0m
[33mThis course assumes that you are using an OpenAI API key.[0m
[33mWe kick off our LLM access[0m
[33mby importing our environment variables[0m
[33mand loading them using Python-dotenv's load_dotenv method.[0m

[33mThen, we import OpenAI from langchain_openai,[0m
[33mand initialize this as our LLM.[0m
[33mNext, we create a prompt template for our chat.[0m
[33mThe main thing to pay attention to in the prompt creation[0m
[33mis that we use it to pass the question[0m
[33mand the context via brackets,[0m
[33mjust like we would with an f-stringing in Python.[0m
[33mOnce we create a prompt string,[0m
[33mwe can use the ChatPromptTemplate object from langchain[0m
[33mto create a prompt template.[0m

[33mWe need two more imports to create our chain.[0m
[33mThe RunnablePassthrough object takes a string[0m
[33mand lets us treat it as a function[0m
[33mby just passing the string through the function.[0m
[33mThe StrOutputParser object takes the output of the chain[0m
[33mand parses it as a string.[0m
[33mTo create a chain,[0m
[33mwe start by getting the context and the question[0m
[33musing the objects we mentioned earlier.[0m
[33mThen, we pass it to the prompt we created[0m
[33mand pass the prompt to the LLM,[0m
[33mand finally, pipe the output of the LLM[0m
[33mto the StrOutputParser.[0m

[33mOnce the chain is created,[0m
[33mwe can get a response by simply invoking the chain.[0m
[33mThe response will take the queries we saw[0m
[33min the query video, combine them,[0m
[33mand return a single string from the given context.[0m
[33mNow that we've seen how to build an example,[0m

[33mAs we mentioned earlier, the names of the documents[0m
[33mare all stored in the vector store via document metadata.[0m

[33mof the notebook,[0m
[33mwe can see that there's some warnings produced.[0m
[33mSome of the chunks are larger than the specified chunk size.[0m
[33mIn this challenge, we're going to modify the code slightly[0m
[33mso that our chunks stay within the chunk size[0m
[33mwithout enforcing any rules[0m
[33mthat will break semantic coherence of each chunk.[0m

[33mHere's a hint.[0m

[33mto solve this challenge.[0m
[33mSo go ahead and give this a try[0m

[33mwe can see that there's two parameters here[0m
[33mthat are automatically set,[0m
[33mseparator and is_separator_Reg X.[0m
[33mNow we can see that the separator parameter[0m
[33mis a double new line.[0m
[33mWhat this means is that even if it goes over the chunk size,[0m
[33mif it doesn't see any double new lines,[0m
[33mit may not form a new chunk.[0m

[33mSo if we want to ensure that we are forming chunks[0m
[33maround the correct chunk size,[0m
[33mwhat we should do is we should add a separator here[0m
[33mand we should define our own custom separator.[0m
[33mIn this case, we're going to define a new line,[0m
[33ma single new line as our own custom separator.[0m
[33mAnd when we run that, we'll see[0m

[33munstructured data types.[0m
[33mAnd vector embeddings are the core[0m
[33mof what makes it possible to compare images.[0m
[33mWhen it comes to using vector embeddings to compare images,[0m
[33mthere are two main types of vectors, semantic vectors,[0m
[33mand visual vectors.[0m
[33mThese vectors describe the image[0m
[33min fundamentally different ways.[0m
[33mLet's cover how.[0m
[33mThe first type of vector embedding[0m
[33mwe can use for comparing images are semantic embeddings.[0m

[33mThese embedding describe the meaning of the image.[0m
[33mThe second type of embeddings are visual[0m
[33mor pixel embeddings.[0m
[33mThese encode what the image literally looks like.[0m
[33mSemantic embeddings are derived from deep learning models.[0m
[33mIn any deep learning model,[0m
[33mthe image data gets passed from the input layer,[0m
[33mthrough a series of hidden layers,[0m
[33mand then to an output layer.[0m
[33mUsually the output layer outputs some sort of prediction,[0m
[33mclassification, or segmentation.[0m

[33mThe second to last layer contains[0m
[33mall of the meaning that the model has derived[0m
[33mfrom its processing to arrive at that prediction,[0m
[33mand that's what we used as the semantic embedding.[0m
[33mThe second to last layer captures[0m
[33mall of what that image means.[0m
[33mThese are the vector embeddings that we typically use[0m

[33mThe other type of vectors that we talk about[0m

[33mThese are really only vector embeddings[0m

[33mAnd if you're familiar with[0m

[33myou'll remember the images are compressed into a vector[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m In order to understand[0m
[33mhow machines compare images,[0m
[33mwe're going to do a crash course of how vision models work.[0m
[33mRemember that vision models are just a type[0m
[33mof deep neural network.[0m
[33mThey are deep neural networks[0m
[33mthat are trained for computer vision tasks,[0m
[33msuch as classification of images,[0m
[33msegmentation, or object detection.[0m
[33mLet's go back in time a bit.[0m
[33mBack in the 1960s, we got our first set of neural networks.[0m

[33mThe first version of neural networks were simple.[0m
[33mThey were modeled as layers of neurons[0m
[33min which each layer was fully connected[0m
[33mto the one coming before and after it.[0m
[33mAs machine learning progressed,[0m
[33mwe learned that modeling neural networks in different ways[0m
[33mgave better results for different types of data.[0m
[33mWhen it comes to vision data,[0m
[33mwe found that this technique called a convolution[0m
[33mwas helpful in getting local context[0m
[33mand getting machines to decipher images.[0m

[33mIn [0m[1;33m1993[0m[33m, the first paper to use max pooling,[0m
[33ma way to collect the output[0m
[33mof convolution layers was published.[0m
[33mThis was the most common type of vision model[0m
[33mfor nearly [0m[1;33m30[0m[33m years.[0m
[33mThen in [0m[1;33m2019[0m[33m, [0m[1;33m1[0m[33m year after the original transformers paper,[0m
[33ma paper that was on how to use[0m
[33mtransformer models for language,[0m
[33ma new paper on vision transformers came out.[0m
[33mVision transformers took the attention mechanism[0m
[33mintroduced in the original transformers paper[0m
[33mand applied it to computer vision.[0m

[33mSo what is a convolutional neural network?[0m
[33mThe defining architecture of convolutional neural networks[0m
[33mis the combination of a convolutional layer[0m
[33mand a pooling layer.[0m
[33mThese two layers help us get context[0m
[33mfrom different places in the image[0m
[33mand combine all these local contexts[0m
[33mto make sense of the image.[0m
[33mLet's take a look at what this looks like visually.[0m
[33mImagine you have a 2D image filled with numbers[0m
[33mlike the one shown here.[0m

[33mThis picture shows how a convolution might work.[0m
[33mIn this case, we are looking at[0m
[33ma three by three convolution.[0m
[33mEach convolution has a filter,[0m
[33mand this filter is learnable,[0m
[33mas in it will change depending on how you train the model.[0m
[33mThe top part of the image shows the result of a convolution,[0m
[33mand the bottom part shows how it's done.[0m
[33mYou take the value of each entry in a convolution[0m
[33mand multiply it element wise with each value in the filter.[0m

[33mThen you add up all of the values in the resulting square[0m
[33mand use that as the result for the square[0m
[33mthat the convolution is based around in the resulting image.[0m
[33mSo that's a convolution and this is pooling.[0m
[33mMax pooling is a bit less complicated than a convolution.[0m
[33mAs shown in the image, all you need to do[0m
[33mis take the max of a value in a pool[0m
[33mand use that to represent the entire region.[0m
[33mIn the red region, we have [0m[1;33m12[0m[33m, [0m[1;33m20[0m[33m, [0m[1;33m8[0m[33m, and [0m[1;33m12[0m[33m.[0m

[33mSo we take [0m[1;33m20[0m[33m as the value to represent that region.[0m
[33mToday's vision model zeitgeist is vision transformers,[0m
[33mderived from the classic transformer model[0m
[33mof using an encoder, a decoder,[0m
[33mand an attention mechanism on an input sequence,[0m
[33mvision transformers takes the inspiration[0m
[33mdrawn from language and applies it to computer vision.[0m
[33mMuch like the idea of convolutional filters,[0m
[33mvision transformers operate in patches.[0m

[33mThese patches are N by N squares[0m
[33mthat each make up a piece of the image.[0m
[33mEach of these patches are turned into embeddings,[0m
[33mas we talked about earlier in the course.[0m
[33mThen these embeddings are put together into the encoder[0m
[33mand mixed with the intention mechanism[0m
[33mas they are fed into the decoder.[0m
[33mHere we see an illustration of how vision transformers work.[0m
[33mIn the bottom left, we see an image split into nine patches.[0m

[33mWe take these nine patches[0m
[33mand turn them into patch embeddings.[0m
[33mThese patch embeddings, often combined with a class token,[0m
[33mdenoted CLS in the diagram,[0m
[33mare then combined with a positional encoding[0m
[33mand fed into the transformer.[0m
[33mThe output is then fed into a multilayer perceptron,[0m
[33malso known as a fully connected neural network,[0m
[33mdenoted as the MLP head in the image,[0m
[33mand out comes logits that describe the image,[0m
[33mtypically some object detection or segmentation type task.[0m

[33m### Introduction to the types of multimodality[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Let's begin by exploring[0m
[33mthe answer to this question,[0m
[33mwhat is multimodality?[0m
[33mThe core idea behind multimodal AI applications[0m
[33mis that they deal with multiple types of data.[0m
[33mThere's a lot of buzz[0m
[33maround the term, multimodal, AI right now,[0m
[33mbut what does it really mean?[0m
[33mLet's take a look from the bottom up.[0m
[33mThe word multimodal comes from multi and modal.[0m

[33mMulti meaning many and modal meaning types.[0m
[33mThe reason why multimodal AI is so popular right now[0m
[33mis because it gives AI more human-like power.[0m
[33mHumans have a multimodal interface with the world.[0m
[33mThink of the senses.[0m
[33mWe have sight, hearing, taste, touch, and smell.[0m
[33mWhen it comes to AI, the two modalities[0m
[33mthat are being emulated the most are closest[0m
[33mto sight and hearing.[0m

[33mWhile the term, multimodal, is still a highly debated term,[0m
[33msome examples of multimodality[0m
[33mcan be classically agreed upon by the industry.[0m
[33mThese examples include images and text,[0m
[33mimages and audio, and video.[0m
[33mNotice that these correspond[0m
[33mto the sense I mentioned earlier.[0m
[33mSight and sound.[0m
[33mImages and texts might both be related to sight,[0m
[33mbut machines process these as two different kinds of data.[0m

[33mWhile some examples of multimodal data are easier[0m
[33mto relate to the idea of human senses,[0m
[33mother more contested examples may not be as easy to relate[0m
[33mto the idea of human senses.[0m
[33mHere are three other examples that fall[0m
[33minto what may be referred to as multimodal.[0m
[33mPDFs and CSVs, texts and tables,[0m
[33mand tables and graphs.[0m
[33mThese examples all fall into the same category[0m
[33mfor human senses, sight.[0m

[33mHowever, the way they're structured[0m
[33mmeans they need to be input into machines[0m
[33min a different way.[0m
[33mDifferent machine learning models need to be trained[0m
[33mto handle each of these different types of data,[0m
[33mand that's why you may occasionally see combinations[0m
[33mof data types like these referred to as multimodal data.[0m

[33m### Ways to do multimodal RAG[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Let's look at some ways[0m
[33mwe can do multimodal RAG.[0m
[33mThe basic idea behind multimodal RAG[0m
[33mis the same as the basic idea behind multimodal data.[0m
[33mSo there's two main ways to do multimodal RAG.[0m
[33mOne, we can use one multimodal model[0m
[33mthat can handle multiple types of data.[0m
[33mTwo, we can use multiple models,[0m
[33musually one for each type of data that we want to work with.[0m
[33mLet's look at how the ways to do multimodal RAG breakdown.[0m

[33mWe can use one multimodal embedding model.[0m
[33mThis will be a model[0m
[33mthat can process multiple types of data,[0m
[33musually images and text.[0m
[33mWe can use multiple embedding models[0m
[33mand multiple search modes.[0m
[33mThese will be models for different types of data,[0m
[33mand we'll need to route each type of data to the right model[0m
[33mfor storing the data and searching the data.[0m
[33mThird, we can just do a combination of the two ways[0m
[33mto do multimodal RAG[0m
[33mand use multiple multimodal models.[0m

[33mWhile this is totally acceptable to do,[0m
[33mthis is extremely uncommon.[0m
[33mThe canonical way to build a multimodal RAG application[0m
[33mis to use a single multimodal model.[0m
[33mAs we talked about before,[0m
[33mmultimodal models are models[0m
[33mthat can handle different types of data.[0m
[33mThis style of building multimodal RAG[0m
[33mhas a couple nice advantages.[0m
[33mOne, you only need one vector store.[0m
[33mTwo, you only need one embedding model.[0m

[33mSince you're using the same model,[0m
[33meach embedding the model produces[0m
[33mwill have the same dimensionality,[0m
[33mso you can compare embeddings of images and text[0m
[33mor whatever types of data you're embedding directly.[0m
[33mIf you're building multimodal RAG natively in this way,[0m
[33myou have to call models differently[0m
[33mfor each data type that you're dealing with.[0m
[33mFor example, CLIP will have image and text options.[0m
[33mHowever, if you use a framework[0m
[33mlike LangChain or LlamaIndex,[0m
[33mthey will typically handle that for you.[0m

[33mThe other way to build multimodal RAG applications[0m
[33mis to use multiple models.[0m
[33mIn this case, you would need one model for each data type,[0m
[33myou would also need a separate vector store[0m
[33mfor each model that you use to create embeddings.[0m
[33mRemember that only vectors of the same size can be compared.[0m
[33mAnd since these vector embeddings[0m
[33mare generated by different models,[0m
[33mit's not likely they'll be the same length.[0m
[33mEven if they are,[0m
[33mit doesn't make sense to compare them[0m
[33mbecause they have different training contexts.[0m

[33mInstead of calling different encoding methods[0m
[33mof a single model to get vector embeddings,[0m
[33mwe would route data to different models[0m
[33mand route the resulting embeddings[0m
[33mto a different vector store depending on its vector type.[0m
[33mEven with most frameworks today,[0m
[33mthis is a manual process[0m
[33mbecause this method of doing multimodal RAG[0m
[33mis extremely uncommon.[0m
[33mThe final combination method to do multimodal RAG[0m
[33mis a spin on the first two methods.[0m
[33mIt's using multiple multimodal models.[0m

[33mAlmost no one uses this method in practice,[0m
[33mso why would you use this?[0m
[33mThere's two main reasons to use a setup like this.[0m
[33mThe first is if you just have[0m
[33mso many different types of data,[0m
[33mthe one multimodal model won't work for you.[0m
[33mMaybe you have video, audio, images,[0m
[33mtable data, and so on and so on.[0m
[33mThe second reason is if you want to re-rank[0m
[33myour vector results,[0m
[33mif you want to use models trained on multiple types[0m
[33mof different data to effectively get a second opinion.[0m

[33mTo build this kind of multimodal RAG model,[0m
[33myou would route data to different models[0m
[33mand vector stores based on their data type.[0m
[33mAnd if you have multiple models[0m
[33mhandling the same data type for re-ranking,[0m
[33myou would route them based on some sort of tagging system.[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m Let's understand multimodal embedding models.[0m
[33mThe main highlight of multimodal embedding models is simple.[0m
[33mThey can embed multiple types of data.[0m
[33mTypically, multimodal embedding models[0m
[33mwill have different functions internally[0m
[33mto embed each type of data.[0m
[33mThis is because embedding each type of data[0m
[33mis a different process in and of itself.[0m
[33mSometimes, data requires pre-processing.[0m

[33mOften, different parts of the model[0m
[33mare trained on and for different types of data.[0m
[33mThe most common practice[0m
[33mfor training multimodal embedding models[0m
[33mis to train them on pairs of data.[0m
[33mImages plus text is the most common pairing of data[0m
[33mto train these types of models on.[0m
[33mSome examples of multimodal embedding models include[0m
[33mCLIP from OpenAI,[0m
[33mlarge language models themselves[0m
[33mthat have evolved to become multimodal,[0m
[33msuch as GPT-4o, also from OpenAI,[0m
[33mand LLaVa,[0m
[33ma state-of-the-art end-to-end large transformer model[0m
[33mthat combines an image encoder in Vicuna, an LLM.[0m

[33mThis model is not from OpenAI.[0m
[33mIn this chapter, we cover CLIP and GPT-4o,[0m
[33mand we use CLIP for embedding[0m
[33mbecause it's free and open source.[0m
[33mCLIP stands for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining.[0m
[33mThe CLIP model has two encoders,[0m
[33mone for encoding images[0m
[33mand one for encoding language or text.[0m
[33mSince this is an open source model,[0m
[33mpublicly available on Hugging Face[0m
[33mand is also state of the art,[0m
[33mthis model is the most popular[0m
[33mmultimodal embedding model to date.[0m

[33mLet's briefly understand how CLIP works[0m
[33mand what the letters mean.[0m
[33mC, contrastive.[0m
[33mThere are many machine learning methods[0m
[33mfor aligning two modalities.[0m
[33mContrastive learning is one of the most powerful[0m
[33mand popular approaches to date.[0m
[33mThis technique takes pairs of data[0m
[33min the same embedding space[0m
[33mand trains both encoders to represent the pairs[0m
[33mas closely as possible.[0m
[33mAt the same time,[0m
[33mthe model is also incentivized[0m
[33mto represent unpaired image/text combos as far as possible.[0m

[33mL-I, language-image.[0m
[33mThe CLIP model takes both text and image as input,[0m
[33mand as we talked about earlier,[0m
[33mit has a different encoder for each.[0m
[33mOne point of importance to note here, though,[0m
[33mis that although the encoders are separate,[0m
[33mthey're still both in the same embedding space[0m
[33mand the vectors have the same dimensionality.[0m
[33mPretraining, P.[0m
[33mThe model is pretrained on [0m[1;33m400[0m[33m million pairs[0m
[33mof image and text data from the internet.[0m

[33mNow that we have an understanding[0m
[33mof multimodal embedding models,[0m
[33mlet's dive into the code.[0m

[33m### Demo: Embedding and storing data[0m

[33m- [0m[1;33m[[0m[33mInstructor[0m[1;33m][0m[33m The code in this video[0m
[33mshould be very familiar.[0m
[33mThis is the exact same code[0m
[33mthat we ran through in chapter [0m[1;33m2[0m
[33mto embed and store our images there.[0m
[33mLet's briefly review.[0m
[33mWe're using langchain to get our OpenCLIPEmbeddings[0m
[33mand storing all of our vectors into FAISS.[0m
[33mWhat we're doing here is we're grabbing all of these images,[0m
[33mencoding them into a Base64 encoding for the LLM,[0m
[33mcreating documents from all of these images,[0m
[33mand then using the OpenCLIPEmbeddings[0m
[33malong with all the documents[0m
[33mto store into the FAISS vector database.[0m

[33mSo, with our vectors already stored,[0m
[33mthe first thing we do is create a retriever object[0m
[33mout of the vector store.[0m
[33mThis part should be familiar.[0m
[33mThis next part will not be as familiar.[0m
[33mWe need two more imports here, BytesIO and Images.[0m
[33mThese are for handling byte data and image data.[0m
[33mIn this code block, we create three functions,[0m
[33ma resizing function to feed the data into OpenAI,[0m
[33ma function to check if you're in Base64,[0m
[33ma function to check if the string is in Base64[0m
[33mand a function to split image and text input.[0m

[33mThe resizing function takes an input[0m
[33min the form of a Base64 string,[0m
[33mand it uses the image and BytesIO library[0m
[33mto open that string as an image, resizes the image,[0m
[33msaves the resized image[0m
[33mand returns that as a Base64-encoded string again.[0m
[33mThe next function simply checks[0m
[33mif you have a Base64 string.[0m
[33mThe third function takes your series of docs.[0m
[33mThe next function takes your input documents,[0m
[33mchecks if you are using an image or a text[0m
[33mand splits the data appropriately.[0m

[33mThe next code block serves to create the prompt[0m
[33mfor our multimodal RAG app.[0m
[33mWe have five imports in this section,[0m
[33mof which three we have not seen before.[0m
[33mHumanMessage, this is the type of message[0m
[33mthat you would expect from a human input.[0m
[33mRunnableLambda, which is just like RunnablePassThrough,[0m
[33mbut it's a function,[0m
[33mand ChatOpenAI, which is a way to access an OpenAI model[0m
[33mas a chat model.[0m

[33mWe need to make one function here.[0m
[33mThis function takes a data dictionary,[0m
[33mand this data dictionary comes from[0m
[33mthis last function that we made up here.[0m
[33mIt takes that dictionary and it splits the image[0m
[33mand text data and formats them into prompts[0m
[33mbefore we turn that into a set of human messages[0m
[33mto feed the LLM.[0m
[33mNext, we get our foundational model,[0m
[33mand the foundational model that we're using is GPT-4o mini,[0m
[33mand then we create a chain.[0m

[33mThis chain is much like the chain we've created before,[0m
[33mexcept instead of using a RunnablePassThrough string[0m
[33mfor everything, we use a RunnableLambda to get our context.[0m
[33mNext, we will invoke the chain,[0m
[33mand we'll ask it to look for a rottweiler in the images.[0m
[33mIt returns an image that the LLM describes[0m
[33mas featuring a rottweiler,[0m
[33mand if we look in our docs[0m
[33mand we retrieve for the text rottweiler,[0m
[33mwe see that the top result is dog_5,[0m
[33mand dog_5 is indeed a rottweiler.[0m

[33mwhich is dog number five.[0m
[33mAnd that is correct.[0m
[33mHere, let's also search with an image.[0m
[33mSo if we encode the image of the cat, we should get cat_1[0m
[33mand we see that we do get cat_1 back[0m
[33mhere as the top results.[0m
[33mNow let's look for a gray cat with long hair in a field.[0m
[33mSo that's this cat, that's cat_2.[0m

[33mAnd when we run this, we actually see[0m
[33mthat dog_5, the Rottweiler, is actually the top results.[0m
[33mAnd we probably need to get a different embedding model[0m
[33mor fine tune our embedding model[0m
[33min order to get the right result here.[0m
[33mHere, we see golden retriever[0m
[33mplaying with an orange ball.[0m
[33mThat's this dog here, dog_2.[0m
[33mAnd we see that our top result is indeed dog_2.[0m
[33mAnd this example, we have golden retriever in a field[0m
[33mwith a sunny blurred background, which is dog number four,[0m
[33mgolden retriever in a field, sunny blurred background.[0m

[33mAnd that actually gives us cat_3,[0m
[33ma gray cat on a laptop as our top result.[0m
[33mOnce again, we see that dog_4 is not in the results,[0m
[33mjust like with cat_2.[0m
[33mSo we probably need to fine tune[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m1[0m[34m. Overall Assessment[0m

[34mThis curriculum presents a well-structured foundation for aspiring and new sales managers transitioning from sales roles. It covers [0m
[34messential aspects of sales management including team building, coaching, strategy development, performance measurement, and specific [0m
[34mtools like Salesforce. The sequence generally follows a logical progression from basic transition challenges to more specialized [0m
[34mmanagement skills. While the curriculum is comprehensive in many areas, there are some minor gaps and potential redundancies that could [0m
[34mbe addressed to create an even more cohesive learning experience for the target audience.[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m2[0m[34m. Detailed Analysis[0m

[34m### a. Topic Coverage[0m

[34mThe curriculum covers most critical aspects needed for new sales managers:[0m

[34m- **Transition fundamentals**: [0m[34m"Transitioning to Management for Salespeople"[0m[34m addresses the specific challenges salespeople face when [0m
[34mmoving to management.[0m
[34m- **Team building**: [0m[34m"Building and Managing a High-Performing Sales Team"[0m[34m covers hiring, training, and team health.[0m
[34m- **Strategy development**: [0m[34m"Sales Strategy"[0m[34m helps managers understand the broader market positioning and competitive advantage.[0m
[34m- **Performance management**: [0m[34m"Sales Performance Measurement and Reporting"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Sales Coaching"[0m[34m provide frameworks for evaluation and [0m
[34mimprovement.[0m
[34m- **Technical tools**: [0m[34m"Salesforce for Sales Managers"[0m[34m addresses a popular CRM system.[0m
[34m- **Financial management**: [0m[34m"Excel: Creating Business Budgets"[0m[34m covers the budgeting aspects of management.[0m

[34mThe coverage is quite thorough for a new sales manager's immediate needs, encompassing people management, strategy, measurement, and [0m
[34mtools.[0m

[34m### b. Prerequisite and Difficulty Scaffolding[0m

[34mThe curriculum shows thoughtful organization in terms of difficulty progression:[0m

[34m- It begins appropriately with [0m[34m"Transitioning to Management for Salespeople,"[0m[34m which establishes the foundational challenges and mindset [0m
[34mshifts required.[0m
[34m- It then builds to team management in [0m[34m"Building and Managing a High-Performing Sales Team."[0m
[34m- More specialized skills like strategy, performance measurement, and coaching follow.[0m
[34m- Technical tools [0m[1;34m([0m[34mSalesforce[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m and financial management [0m[1;34m([0m[34mExcel budgeting[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m come later, which is appropriate since they build on earlier [0m
[34mconceptual understanding.[0m

[34mThe progression from personal transition to team management to specialized skills and tools follows a logical learning path for new [0m
[34mmanagers.[0m

[34m### c. Course Relevance and Fit[0m

[34mMost courses fit well for the target audience with a few considerations:[0m

[34m- **High relevance**: [0m[34m"Transitioning to Management for Salespeople,"[0m[34m [0m[34m"Building and Managing a High-Performing Sales Team,"[0m[34m [0m[34m"Sales [0m
[34mCoaching,"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Sales Performance Measurement and Reporting"[0m[34m are directly applicable to the audience's immediate needs.[0m

[34m- **Moderate relevance**: [0m[34m"Sales Strategy"[0m[34m seems somewhat broader than what a new sales manager might immediately need, as strategy is [0m
[34moften set at higher levels, though understanding it is valuable.[0m

[34m- **Questionable fit**: [0m[34m"Excel: Creating Business Budgets"[0m[34m feels somewhat peripheral. While budgeting is important, this appears to be a [0m
[34mgeneral business budgeting course rather than one specifically focused on sales budgeting, forecasting, and quota setting.[0m

[34m### d. Content Redundancy[0m

[34mThere appears to be some overlap in the following areas:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Coaching content**: Both [0m[34m"Transitioning to Management for Salespeople"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Sales Coaching"[0m[34m cover coaching, potentially with [0m
[34mredundancy. The first course mentions [0m[34m"sales skills coaching"[0m[34m while the dedicated coaching course covers similar territory.[0m

[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Performance management**: [0m[34m"Sales Performance Measurement and Reporting"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Building and Managing a High-Performing Sales Team"[0m[34m [0m
[34mboth address monitoring team performance and health, though likely from different angles.[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Pipeline management**: Referenced in [0m[34m"Transitioning to Management for Salespeople"[0m[34m and likely covered again in [0m[34m"Salesforce for Sales[0m
[34mManagers"[0m[34m and potentially in [0m[34m"Sales Performance Measurement and Reporting."[0m

[34mWhile some overlap reinforces important concepts, these areas could potentially be streamlined.[0m

[34m### e. Identified Gaps or Missing Topics[0m

[34mSeveral important topics for new sales managers appear underrepresented:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Compensation design and management**: While performance measurement is covered, there's limited content on designing and managing [0m
[34msales compensation plans, a critical skill for motivating sales teams.[0m

[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Sales territory design and assignment**: Effectively allocating territories among team members is not explicitly addressed.[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Remote/virtual sales team management**: Given today's hybrid work environments, specific guidance on managing distributed sales [0m
[34mteams would be valuable.[0m

[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Change management**: New managers often need to implement changes; guidance on leading teams through transitions would be helpful.[0m

[33m## Sales Time Management[0m
[33mFor sales roles in particular, time management is a fundamental requirement and a powerful enhancement to your potential performance and [0m

[33mcan't. She also identifies common negotiation traps and ways to negotiate that don't just close the sale today, but build longer-term [0m
[33mrelationships for tomorrow.[0m

[33mCold calling is one of the best tools available for lead generation. But the process is plagued with hard-to-overcome objections that can[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m1[0m[34m. Overall Assessment[0m

[34mThe Sales Foundations Professional Certificate by the National Association of Sales Professions provides a well-structured and [0m
[34mcomprehensive curriculum for individuals new to a career in sales. The curriculum effectively balances foundational soft skills with [0m
[34mpractical sales techniques, progressing from personal development to specific sales methodologies. It addresses most critical aspects [0m
[34mneeded for new sales professionals, though there are a few gaps that could be addressed to make it more complete.[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m2[0m[34m. Detailed Analysis[0m

[34m### a. Topic Coverage[0m

[34mThe curriculum covers a broad range of essential sales topics:[0m

[34m- **Personal development** [0m[1;34m([0m[34mself-confidence, professional relationships[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- **Time management** specific to sales roles[0m
[34m- **Negotiation** skills with a purpose-driven approach[0m
[34m- **Cold calling** and handling objections[0m
[34m- **Soft skills** and emotional intelligence[0m
[34m- **Prospecting** techniques for modern buyers[0m
[34m- **Persuasion** psychology and applying it throughout the sales process[0m

[34mThis coverage is appropriate for newcomers to sales, providing both foundational skills and practical techniques. The curriculum balances[0m
[34minternal development [0m[1;34m([0m[34mconfidence, time management[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m with external skills [0m[1;34m([0m[34mprospecting, negotiation[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m, which is valuable for beginners.[0m

[34m### b. Prerequisite and Difficulty Scaffolding[0m

[34mThe curriculum demonstrates effective scaffolding:[0m

[34m- It begins with foundational skills in [0m[34m"Prepare Yourself for a Career in Sales,"[0m[34m establishing the mindset needed for success[0m
[34m- Progresses to practical skills like time management before moving to more complex topics[0m
[34m- Advances to challenging aspects like negotiation and handling objections after establishing basics[0m
[34m- Concludes with persuasive selling, which effectively integrates psychological concepts into the entire sales process[0m

[34mThe progression from personal development to tactical skills to strategic approaches shows thoughtful organization. For example, [0m
[34munderstanding oneself and managing time [0m[1;34m([0m[34mcourses [0m[1;34m1[0m[34m-[0m[1;34m2[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m creates the foundation needed before learning how to negotiate [0m[1;34m([0m[34mcourse [0m[1;34m3[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m or handle[0m

[34m### c. Course Relevance and Fit[0m

[34mAll courses are highly relevant for the target audience of sales newcomers:[0m

[34m- [0m[34m"Prepare Yourself for a Career in Sales"[0m[34m directly addresses beginners with foundational confidence-building[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Sales Time Management"[0m[34m addresses a critical skill that new salespeople often struggle with[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Cold Calling"[0m[34m tackles one of the most intimidating aspects of sales for beginners[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Soft Skills for Sales Professionals"[0m[34m acknowledges that product knowledge alone isn't sufficient[0m

[34mThe focus on both mindset and practical techniques is particularly appropriate for new sales professionals who need both confidence and [0m
[34mconcrete methods.[0m

[34m### d. Content Redundancy[0m

[34mThere is minimal problematic redundancy in the curriculum. While some overlap exists in communication skills across courses, each [0m
[34mapproaches these skills from different angles:[0m

[34m- [0m[34m"Soft Skills"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Prepare Yourself for a Career"[0m[34m both discuss relationships, but from different perspectives[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Persuasive Selling"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Sales Negotiation"[0m[34m might touch on similar influence principles, but with distinct applications[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Cold Calling"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Sales Prospecting"[0m[34m have some overlap in approaching prospects, but the first focuses on objection handling while [0m
[34mthe second on overall strategy[0m

[34mThis intentional reinforcement of key concepts from different angles is beneficial for new learners rather than redundant.[0m

[34m### e. Identified Gaps or Missing Topics[0m

[34mSeveral important topics for new sales professionals appear to be missing or underrepresented:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **CRM and Sales Technology** - No dedicated course on using customer relationship management systems and sales technology tools [0m
[34messential in modern sales[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Sales Process Fundamentals** - While individual techniques are covered, a structured overview of the typical sales process stages is[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Product Knowledge Translation** - How to effectively learn about products/services and translate features into benefits[0m
[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Sales Metrics and Analytics** - Understanding key performance indicators and how to track/improve them[0m
[1;34m5[0m[34m. **Remote/Virtual Selling** - Limited coverage of digital selling environments that are increasingly common[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m3[0m[34m. Recommendations[0m

[34m### Curriculum Enhancements[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Add a Foundational Sales Process Course** - Place this early in the curriculum to provide a framework for understanding how [0m
[34mindividual techniques fit into the overall sales journey.[0m

[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Incorporate Technology Training** - Add a course on CRM usage, sales automation, and digital tools, positioned after time management[0m
[34mbut before prospecting.[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Include Remote Selling Module** - Either add a dedicated course or expand existing courses to address virtual presentations, digital[0m
[34mrelationship building, and online communication skills.[0m

[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Add Performance Measurement Content** - Incorporate training on understanding and using sales metrics to improve performance.[0m

[1;34m5[0m[34m. **Reorder Slightly** - Consider moving [0m[34m"Soft Skills for Sales Professionals"[0m[34m earlier in the sequence, perhaps after the initial [0m
[34mpreparation course, as these skills underpin all other sales activities.[0m

[34m### Content Integration Opportunities[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. Ensure the [0m[34m"Persuasive Selling"[0m[34m course explicitly connects psychological concepts to the specific techniques taught in earlier [0m
[34mcourses.[0m

[1;34m2[0m[34m. Add case studies or scenario-based learning that requires integrating multiple skills across courses.[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. Create a capstone project that challenges learners to demonstrate mastery of the full curriculum in a simulated sales scenario.[0m

[34mThe curriculum provides a solid foundation but would benefit from these additions to fully prepare today's new sales professionals for [0m
[34mthe technological and process-oriented aspects of modern sales environments.[0m

[34m# My Journey Through Sales Training Courses[0m

[34m## Course [0m[1;34m1[0m[34m: Prepare Yourself for a Career in Sales[0m

[34mThis first course seems perfect for me as someone considering a sales career. It's giving me a foundation to understand what I'm getting [0m
[34minto.[0m

[34mStarting with the introduction, I'm learning that sales careers are rewarding but challenging, which feels honest. I appreciate that [0m
[34mthey're upfront about ongoing training being essential - shows this isn't a [0m[34m"get rich quick"[0m[34m path.[0m

[34mThe [0m[34m"Developing Yourself"[0m[34m section caught my attention because it focuses on personal attributes rather than just techniques:[0m
[34m- Being authentic and vulnerable seems important for building trust[0m
[34m- Keeping myself honest is fundamental - integrity matters[0m
[34m- Self-confidence balanced with keeping my ego in check[0m

[34mThe [0m[34m"Practical Skills"[0m[34m section introduces core competencies:[0m
[34m- Prioritizing important tasks makes sense - I can see how this would help manage multiple leads[0m
[34m- Taking action rather than overthinking seems crucial[0m
[34m- Listening skills are highlighted - interesting that they mention buyers often say salespeople do this poorly[0m

[34mThe relationship-building section resonates with me:[0m
[34m- First impressions matter[0m
[34m- Honoring commitments and admitting mistakes builds credibility[0m
[34m- Knowing your audience helps tailor approaches[0m

[34mThis course seems to be laying a foundation of character and mindset before diving into specific techniques. As someone new to sales, I [0m
[34mappreciate this approach - it's helping me understand if my personality is a good fit for sales.[0m

[34m## Course [0m[1;34m2[0m[34m: Sales Foundations[0m

[34mNow I'm moving from personal qualities into the actual mechanics of sales. The course title [0m[34m"Sales Foundations"[0m[34m suggests it's building on[0m
[34mthe personal development from the first course.[0m

[34mThe course explores the sales mindset versus the buyer mindset, which feels like an important distinction. I'm learning to think from [0m
[34mboth perspectives.[0m

[34mThe customer-centric focus makes sense - it's teaching me to:[0m
[34m- Create a prospecting process to identify ideal customers[0m
[34m- Identify customer issues and motivations when buying[0m
[34m- Recognize barriers to change[0m

[34mI'm seeing how crucial it is to position my product as a solution rather than just listing features. The course covers:[0m
[34m- How to frame solutions to customer problems[0m
[34m- Showing proof my solution works[0m
[34m- Supporting implementation[0m

[34mThe course emphasizes having an effective sales process, which seems to be about creating a repeatable, systematic approach rather than [0m
[34mjust winging it. This connects back to the first course's mentions of discipline and prioritization.[0m

[34mI'm noticing there are three different versions of this course listed [0m[1;34m([0m[34mwith different durations[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m. That's a bit confusing, but the content[0m
[34mseems consistent across all three.[0m

[34m## Course [0m[1;34m3[0m[34m: Creating Your Sales Process[0m

[34mThis course builds directly on the previous one by diving deeper into the sales process that was introduced. Now I'm learning the [0m
[34mspecific steps and how to customize them.[0m

[34mThe distinction between sales process and sales methodology is helpful - I hadn't thought about that difference before.[0m

[34mThe course breaks down the sales process into clear stages:[0m
[1;34m1[0m[34m. Developing the Sale[0m
[34m   - Prospecting [0m[1;34m([0m[34mfinding potential customers[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m   - Planning and research[0m
[34m   - Discovery [0m[1;34m([0m[34masking questions to understand needs[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m   - Solving with a product/service[0m

[1;34m2[0m[34m. Making the Sale[0m
[34m   - Presenting[0m
[34m   - Handling objections[0m
[34m   - Closing[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. After the Close[0m
[34m   - Delivering on promises[0m
[34m   - Following up[0m
[34m   - Reporting back to the company[0m

[34mI appreciate that this course doesn't end at closing the sale but continues into delivery and follow-up. That shows me sales isn't just [0m
[34mabout getting someone to say [0m[34m"yes"[0m[34m but about creating long-term relationships.[0m

[34mThe section on [0m[34m"Continuously Improving Your Process"[0m[34m connects to the ongoing learning mentioned in the first course. I'm seeing how sales[0m
[34mis a career of constant refinement and growth.[0m

[34m## Course [0m[1;34m4[0m[34m: Soft Skills for Sales Professionals[0m

[34mThis course seems complementary to the previous ones, focusing on soft skills rather than just the mechanics of the sales process.[0m

[34mI'm learning how the sales landscape has changed, making soft skills more important than ever. The distinction between hard skills [0m
[1;34m([0m[34mtechnical knowledge[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m and soft skills [0m[1;34m([0m[34minterpersonal abilities[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m is helpful.[0m

[34mThe course introduces [0m[34m"new soft skills"[0m[34m I hadn't considered:[0m
[34m- Multi-level communication[0m
[34m- Cognitive flexibility[0m
[34m- Self-awareness and management[0m
[34m- Complex problem solving[0m
[34m- Digital expertise[0m
[34m- Analytical thinking[0m
[34m- Active learning[0m
[34m- Critical decision making[0m
[34m- Ideation[0m

[34mWhat's interesting is how these skills go beyond traditional [0m[34m"people skills"[0m[34m - they include cognitive and analytical abilities too. I can[0m
[34msee how practicing and improving these skills could give me a competitive advantage.[0m

[34mThe section on [0m[34m"Executing on the New Soft Skills"[0m[34m seems practical, helping me integrate these concepts into my daily work.[0m

[34m## Course [0m[1;34m5[0m[34m: Sales Prospecting: How to Connect with Today's Busy Buyers[0m

[34mNow the training is getting more specific, focusing on the first stage of the sales process: prospecting. This makes sense as a [0m
[34mprogression - first understand myself and the overall process, then learn how to find potential customers.[0m

[34mThe course is teaching me how to:[0m
[34m- Identify the best channels to prospect within[0m
[34m- Define target roles/titles who can buy from me[0m
[34m- Set goals for prospecting activity[0m
[34m- Track progress with metrics[0m

[34mI'm learning about [0m[34m"touchpoint strategy"[0m[34m - creating a plan for how to reach prospects across multiple contact attempts. This includes:[0m
[34m- Selecting the best methods to reach prospects[0m
[34m- Deciding on the frequency and timing of outreach[0m
[34m- Building a step-by-step guide for effective outreach[0m

[34mThe section on standing out from competition seems valuable - it's addressing the reality that I'll be competing with others for my [0m
[34mprospect's attention. Learning how to introduce value and be responsive gives me concrete ways to differentiate myself.[0m

[34mThe course concludes with how to continuously improve my prospecting, including dealing with difficult prospects and managing an influx [0m
[34mof leads. This progressive approach makes sense - start with the basics, then address more complex scenarios.[0m

[34m## Course [0m[1;34m6[0m[34m: Cold Calling: Overcoming Sales Objections[0m

[34mThis course feels like a natural next step - after learning how to prospect, I now need to know how to handle objections when I make [0m
[34mthose calls.[0m

[34mThe course is structured around specific objections I might hear:[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"This isn't a priority right now"[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Just send me an email"[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"I've never heard of you"[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"You're the same as the rest"[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"I'm locked in another contract"[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"This is too expensive"[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"It's not my decision"[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"I don't need it"[0m

[34mFor each objection, I'm learning:[0m
[34m- What prospects really mean when they say this[0m
[34m- How to respond effectively[0m
[34m- Techniques to move the conversation forward[0m

[34mThis is extremely practical training - I can see myself using these responses directly in my work. The [0m[34m"What they really mean"[0m[34m sections [0m
[34mare particularly insightful, helping me understand the psychology behind objections.[0m

[34m## Course [0m[1;34m7[0m[34m: Sales Negotiation[0m

[34mNow I'm moving from handling objections to the actual negotiation process. This seems like a logical progression in my sales education.[0m

[34mThe course starts by explaining why sales negotiations are different from other types of negotiations, which is helpful context.[0m

[34mI'm learning that compromise isn't always the best approach - instead, I should:[0m
[34m- Use the [0m[34m"Triangle of Truth"[0m[34m model to avoid false dichotomies[0m
[34m- Start negotiations with [0m[34m"noble purpose"[0m[34m to find win-win solutions[0m
[34m- Embrace uncertainty as an ally in finding creative solutions[0m

[34mThe course identifies three kinds of negotiations:[0m
[1;34m1[0m[34m. Churn and burn[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. In it to win it[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. Long haul leverages[0m

[34mThis helps me adapt my approach based on the situation.[0m

[34mI'm also learning practical skills for specific negotiation challenges:[0m
[34m- Telling the difference between a buyer and negotiator[0m
[34m- Handling a buyer who discusses price without value[0m
[34m- Dealing with a buyer who belittles value to reduce price[0m
[34m- Managing when a boss gets inserted at the last minute[0m

[34mThe final section covers how to make negotiations [0m[34m"stick"[0m[34m - ensuring the deal closes and holds. This includes when to use my boss, how to[0m
[34mdiffuse anger, negotiating via email, and knowing when to walk away.[0m

[34mThis course feels more advanced than the earlier ones, building on the foundation of understanding customers and handling objections.[0m

[34m## Course [0m[1;34m8[0m[34m: Persuasive Selling[0m

[34mThis course seems to pull together everything I've learned so far, focusing on the psychology of persuasion in sales.[0m

[34mIt introduces eight key psychological concepts that drive buyer behavior:[0m
[34m- Reciprocation[0m
[34m- Liking[0m
[34m- Social proof[0m
[34m- Authority[0m
[34m- Consistency[0m
[34m- Scarcity[0m
[34m- Contrast[0m
[34m- Because[0m

[34mWhat's helpful is how the course maps these concepts to different stages of the sales cycle, showing me when to apply each principle.[0m

[34mThe course then walks through each stage of the sales process through the lens of psychology:[0m
[34m- Prospecting: Why someone should want to meet with me[0m
[34m- Initial meeting: Making strong first impressions[0m
[34m- Qualification: Identifying ideal clients[0m
[34m- Presentation: How to present effectively and provide options[0m
[34m- Objections: Anticipating and embracing objections[0m
[34m- Negotiating: Understanding the value equation and relationship importance[0m
[34m- Closing: Building strong relationships[0m
[34m- Referrals: Asking effectively and timing requests[0m

[34mThis psychological approach gives me deeper insight into why the techniques from previous courses work, not just how to use them. It's [0m
[34madding a layer of understanding that makes everything come together.[0m

[34m## Course [0m[1;34m9[0m[34m: Sales Time Management[0m

[34mThe final course focuses on time management, which makes perfect sense - now that I understand the sales process and techniques, I need [0m
[34mto learn how to fit everything into my work day efficiently.[0m

[34mI'm learning about the [0m[34m"sales clock"[0m[34m - segmenting my day into specific time blocks for different sales activities. This structured [0m
[34mapproach seems like it would help me stay focused.[0m

[34mThe course covers planning at different time scales:[0m
[34m- Years[0m
[34m- Quarters[0m
[34m- Months[0m
[34m- Weeks[0m

[34mThis multi-level planning approach would help me align with both business cycles and my personal workflow.[0m

[34mThe [0m[34m"Becoming Streamlined"[0m[34m section teaches practical skills:[0m
[34m- Focusing on things that matter[0m
[34m- Saying [0m[34m"no"[0m[34m to less important tasks[0m
[34m- Negotiating expectations[0m
[34m- Delegating effectively[0m
[34m- Avoiding perfectionism[0m
[34m- Using technology to advantage[0m

[34mThe section on technology tools covers:[0m
[34m- Communication tools[0m
[34m- Memory aids[0m
[34m- Efficiency technology[0m
[34m- Research tools[0m

[34mThis final course completes my education by helping me implement everything I've learned in an efficient, sustainable way.[0m

[34m## Overall Reflections[0m

[34mThis curriculum has taken me on a logical journey from understanding myself and the fundamentals of sales to mastering specific [0m
[34mtechniques and finally organizing my time effectively.[0m

[34mI appreciate how the courses build on each other:[0m
[1;34m1[0m[34m. Personal attributes and mindset[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. Sales foundations and process[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. Specific skills [0m[1;34m([0m[34mprospecting, objection handling, negotiation[0m[1;34m)[0m
[1;34m4[0m[34m. Psychological understanding[0m
[1;34m5[0m[34m. Time management[0m

[34mAs someone considering a sales career, this gives me confidence that I'm learning a comprehensive approach. I like that the curriculum [0m
[34memphasizes ethical selling and relationship-building rather than manipulative techniques.[0m

[34mOne potential gap I notice is that there isn't much specific content about selling in digital environments or social selling, which seems[0m

[34mexist.[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m2[0m[34m. Detailed Analysis[0m

[34m### a. Topic Coverage[0m

[34mThe curriculum covers essential sales topics required for beginners:[0m

[34m- Personal development and soft skills [0m[1;34m([0m[34min [0m[34m"Prepare Yourself for a Career in Sales"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Soft Skills for Sales Professionals"[0m[1;34m)[0m

[34m- Advanced skills in negotiation and persuasion [0m[1;34m([0m[34min [0m[34m"Sales Negotiation"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Persuasive Selling"[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- Productivity management [0m[1;34m([0m[34min [0m[34m"Sales Time Management"[0m[1;34m)[0m

[34mThis broad coverage ensures new sales professionals understand both the psychological and tactical aspects of sales success.[0m

[34m### b. Prerequisite and Difficulty Scaffolding[0m

[34mThe curriculum demonstrates effective scaffolding:[0m

[34m- It begins appropriately with self-development and foundational concepts before moving to specific techniques[0m
[34m- The early courses like [0m[34m"Prepare Yourself for a Career in Sales"[0m[34m require no prerequisites, making them accessible to complete beginners[0m
[34m- The [0m[34m"Sales Foundations"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Creating Your Sales Process"[0m[34m courses establish core knowledge before advancing to specialized topics[0m
[34m- More complex skills like negotiation, persuasion techniques, and objection handling appear later in the curriculum[0m
[34m- The final course on time management helps tie everything together from a productivity perspective[0m

[34mThe progression from personal development to sales fundamentals to specialized skills represents logical scaffolding for beginners.[0m

[34m### c. Course Relevance and Fit[0m

[34mAll courses appear highly relevant for new sales professionals:[0m

[34m- [0m[34m"Prepare Yourself for a Career in Sales"[0m[34m addresses self-confidence and relationship building—fundamental for beginners[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Sales Foundations"[0m[34m focuses on understanding customer needs before selling—a critical mindset shift for newcomers[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Creating Your Sales Process"[0m[34m provides a structured [0m[1;34m10[0m[34m-step framework that beginners need[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Soft Skills for Sales Professionals"[0m[34m addresses the often-overlooked relational aspects of sales[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Sales Prospecting"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Cold Calling"[0m[34m offer specific tactical guidance on lead generation[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Sales Negotiation"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Persuasive Selling"[0m[34m provide psychological frameworks for common sales challenges[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Sales Time Management"[0m[34m addresses productivity, which is especially important for those new to balancing all sales responsibilities[0m

[34mThe curriculum appropriately focuses on both mindset and tactical skills relevant to beginners in sales.[0m

[34m### d. Content Redundancy[0m

[34mThere is minimal harmful redundancy, though some intentional reinforcement exists:[0m

[34m- [0m[34m"Prepare Yourself for a Career in Sales"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Soft Skills for Sales Professionals"[0m[34m both cover relationship-building aspects, but the [0m
[34mfirst focuses on self-development while the second addresses emotional intelligence and adaptability[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Sales Foundations"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Creating Your Sales Process"[0m[34m both discuss sales processes, but the former focuses on understanding customer [0m
[34mneeds while the latter provides a specific step-by-step framework[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Sales Prospecting"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Cold Calling"[0m[34m might have some overlap in prospecting concepts, but the latter specifically focuses on handling[0m
[34mobjections during cold calls[0m

[34mThe reinforcement appears intentional rather than wasteful, allowing key concepts to be approached from different angles.[0m

[34m### e. Identified Gaps or Missing Topics[0m

[34mDespite comprehensive coverage, a few gaps exist:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **CRM and sales technology**: There's limited coverage of using Customer Relationship Management systems and other sales technologies [0m
[34mthat are standard in modern sales environments[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Industry-specific sales approaches**: The curriculum focuses on general sales principles without addressing how approaches might [0m
[34mdiffer across industries [0m[1;34m([0m[34mB2B vs. B2C, service vs. product sales[0m[1;34m)[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Remote/virtual selling**: While mentioned briefly in [0m[34m"Soft Skills,"[0m[34m a more dedicated focus on virtual selling techniques would be [0m
[34mvaluable in today's sales environment[0m
[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Metrics and analytics**: Understanding sales metrics, KPIs, and how to measure personal performance is not extensively covered[0m
[1;34m5[0m[34m. **Role-playing practice**: The curriculum would benefit from more explicit practice exercises or role-playing scenarios for beginners [0m
[34mto apply learning[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m3[0m[34m. Recommendations[0m

[34mTo enhance the curriculum's effectiveness for sales beginners, I recommend:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Add a course on sales technology**: Include a specific module on CRM systems, sales enablement tools, and digital sales platforms to[0m
[34mprepare beginners for the technological aspects of modern sales roles[0m

[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Expand virtual selling content**: Either incorporate more virtual selling techniques into existing courses or create a dedicated [0m
[34mshort module on remote sales effectiveness[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Include practice scenarios**: Add role-playing exercises or practice scenarios throughout the curriculum to help beginners apply [0m
[34mconcepts in simulated environments[0m

[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Add content on sales metrics**: Incorporate material on understanding and using sales metrics, dashboard analysis, and performance [0m
[34mmeasurement[0m

[1;34m5[0m[34m. **Consider reordering [0m[34m"Soft Skills"[0m[34m**: This course might be more effective placed earlier in the curriculum, perhaps immediately after[0m
[34m"Prepare Yourself for a Career in Sales,"[0m[34m to establish the interpersonal foundation before diving into process creation[0m

[1;34m6[0m[34m. **Add industry differentiation**: Include content that addresses how sales approaches might differ across industries or market [0m
[34msegments[0m

[34mThe curriculum provides an excellent foundation as is, but these additions would address existing gaps and better prepare newcomers for [0m

[34m# Curriculum Review: Transitioning to Management for Salespeople[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m1[0m[34m. Overall Assessment[0m

[34mThis curriculum provides a strong foundation for salespeople transitioning to management roles or new sales managers. It comprehensively [0m
[34mcovers key aspects of sales management from hiring and building teams to strategy development, coaching, motivation, and performance [0m
[34mmeasurement. The courses feature experienced instructors with practical expertise, and the content appears directly applicable to the [0m
[34mchallenges faced by new sales managers. While there is some content overlap, particularly in the hiring and team-building courses, this [0m
[34mreinforcement is largely beneficial for the target audience. The curriculum effectively addresses the topic and would provide valuable [0m
[34mguidance to salespeople making the transition to management.[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m2[0m[34m. Detailed Analysis[0m

[34m### a. Topic Coverage[0m

[34mThe curriculum covers an impressive range of essential topics for new sales managers:[0m

[34m- Fundamentals of transitioning from sales to management [0m[1;34m([0m[34min [0m[34m"Transitioning to Management for Salespeople"[0m[1;34m)[0m

[34m- Team motivation [0m[1;34m([0m[34min [0m[34m"How to Motivate Your Sales Teams"[0m[1;34m)[0m

[34mThese topics collectively address the core competencies that a new sales manager would need to develop. The curriculum balances tactical [0m
[34mskills [0m[1;34m([0m[34mlike coaching and hiring[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m with strategic elements [0m[1;34m([0m[34mlike territory management and operations[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m.[0m

[34m### b. Prerequisite and Difficulty Scaffolding[0m

[34mThe curriculum does not appear to be deliberately sequenced from basic to advanced concepts, which is a minor issue. However, the courses[0m
[34mgenerally provide sufficient context for their topics:[0m

[34m- [0m[34m"Transitioning to Management for Salespeople"[0m[34m by Lisa Earle McLeod serves as an excellent entry point, directly addressing the [0m
[34mchallenges of the role shift.[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Sales Management Foundations"[0m[34m by Drew Boyd provides a comprehensive overview that establishes core concepts.[0m
[34m- The subsequent courses build on these fundamentals with more specialized topics.[0m

[34mThe difficulty progression could be improved by reordering courses to start with fundamental concepts and move toward more specialized or[0m
[34madvanced topics, such as placing [0m[34m"Sales Operations"[0m[34m later in the sequence.[0m

[34m### c. Course Relevance and Fit[0m

[34mAll courses fit the intended audience and topic well. Particularly relevant are:[0m

[34m- [0m[34m"Transitioning to Management for Salespeople"[0m[34m - Directly addresses the audience's situation[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Sales Coaching"[0m[34m - Focuses on a critical skill that distinguishes management from individual contribution[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"How to Hire Great Salespeople"[0m[34m - Essential for new managers who likely lack hiring experience[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Sales Performance Measurement and Reporting"[0m[34m - Provides concrete guidance on evaluation responsibilities[0m

[34mEach course appears designed for practical application rather than theoretical knowledge, which is appropriate for sales professionals [0m
[34mmoving into management.[0m

[34m### d. Content Redundancy[0m

[34mThere is some overlap in content, particularly around hiring and team building:[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"How to Hire Great Salespeople"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Building and Managing a High-Performing Sales Team"[0m[34m cover similar recruiting concepts[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"How to Motivate Your Sales Teams"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"Building and Managing a High-Performing Sales Team"[0m[34m both address team motivation[0m
[34m- Multiple courses discuss coaching techniques[0m

[34mHowever, this redundancy isn't necessarily problematic as:[0m
[1;34m1[0m[34m. Hiring and team building are critical skills that benefit from reinforcement and multiple perspectives[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. Each course appears to offer unique frameworks and approaches[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. Different instructors provide varied perspectives on these topics[0m

[34m### e. Identified Gaps or Missing Topics[0m

[34mDespite comprehensive coverage, a few important areas for new sales managers appear underrepresented:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Change management and personal transition** - While [0m[34m"Transitioning to Management for Salespeople"[0m[34m touches on this, more guidance on [0m
[34mmanaging the personal identity shift from peer to leader could be valuable[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Managing difficult conversations and performance issues** - The curriculum lacks focused content on having tough conversations, [0m
[34mmanaging performance improvement plans, or handling terminations[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Time management and prioritization for managers** - New managers often struggle with balancing their own selling [0m[1;34m([0m[34mif required[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m, [0m
[34mcoaching, administration, and strategic responsibilities[0m
[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Cross-functional leadership** - While mentioned in [0m[34m"Transitioning to Management,"[0m[34m deeper content on working with marketing, product,[0m
[34mand finance teams would be beneficial[0m
[1;34m5[0m[34m. **Navigating organizational politics** - Guidance on managing up and across the organization is limited[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m3[0m[34m. Recommendations[0m

[34m### Curriculum Reordering[0m

[34mI recommend reorganizing the curriculum to create a more logical progression:[0m

[34m### Additional Content Recommendations[0m

[34mTo address the identified gaps, consider adding courses that focus on:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Personal Transition and Identity** - A course specifically on making the mental shift from individual contributor to leader[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Difficult Conversations and Performance Management** - Practical guidance on addressing underperformance, conducting terminations, [0m
[34mand having challenging discussions[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Time Management for Sales Leaders** - Strategies for balancing competing priorities specific to sales management[0m
[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Cross-Functional Leadership** - Deeper content on working with marketing, product development, customer service, and finance[0m

[34m### Content Consolidation[0m

[34mIf the curriculum needs streamlining, consider:[0m
[34m- Combining [0m[34m"How to Hire Great Salespeople"[0m[34m and hiring aspects of [0m[34m"Building and Managing a High-Performing Sales Team"[0m
[34m- Creating a more concise version that maintains the critical topics but reduces overall length[0m

[34mOverall, this curriculum provides excellent content for its intended audience with only minor structural improvements needed to enhance [0m

[33mFirst, carefully review the following curriculum:[0m

[1;33m<[0m[1;33mcurriculum[0m[33m>[0m
[33m## Human Resources: Payroll[0m
[33mPayroll is a core function in human resources departments everywhere. Complex tax and labor laws can make it seem [0m
[33mdaunting, but with the right tools and techniques, your payroll can function like a well-oiled machine. Join HR [0m
[33mconsultant and instructor Gabriella Parente-Neubert as she shows you how to set up and administer payroll, covering [0m
[33msome of the most common topics, from fundamental entitlements all the way to employer [0m
[33mcompliance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get tips on classifying workers, understanding exempt versus nonexempt employees, [0m
[33mretaining records for future access, and picking a payroll system. Gabriella reviews the details of sick leave, [0m
[33mvacation time, maternity and paternity leave, jury duty, the role of benefits in compensation, and how to process final[0m
[33mwages in the event of termination. Using her guidance, you'll be able to build a successful payroll system that ensures[0m
[33myour employees are paid equitably, correctly, and punctually every time.[0m
[33m## Human Resources: Selecting an HR System[0m
[33mLearn how to select the right HR information system [0m[1;33m([0m[33mHRIS[0m[1;33m)[0m[33m for your organization. An HRIS is designed to manage the [0m
[33mdata of the workplace and the entire employee lifecycle: from hiring to managing payroll, benefits, and training. Due [0m
[33mto advances in technology and decreases in cost, these solutions are more realistic for all companiesâ€”but not all HR [0m
[33msystems are made alike. This course can help you identify an HRIS system that will work best for your company. Learn [0m
[33mwhat internal factors to consider in your purchase, including day-to-day and strategic company needs. Discover how to [0m
[33midentify potential vendors, and generate request for information [0m[1;33m([0m[33mRFIs[0m[1;33m)[0m[33m and requests for proposals [0m[1;33m([0m[33mRFPs[0m[1;33m)[0m[33m in order to [0m
[33msolicit bids. Instructor Don Phin also explains the right questions to ask at every stage of the buying process.[0m
[33m## Human Resources: Compensation and Benefits[0m
[33mTo attract and retain top talent, it's crucial for companies to get compensation and benefits right. When employees [0m
[33mfeel that they're paid fairly for what they do, there's greater incentive for them to excel in the workplace. This [0m
[33mcourse provides an overview of the strategic choices that employers must make when developing a total rewards system. [0m
[33mHR expert Wayne Cascio addresses management, policy, and legal issues in developing pay structures, incentive plans, [0m
[33mand benefit offerings. He discusses how to establish an effective performance review process, how pay surveys drive [0m
[33mdecisions about compensation and benefits, the role of HR technology, and more.[0m
[33m## Human Resources: Pay Strategy[0m
[33mHaving a solid, intentional pay strategy for your organization has never been more important. Author Lynne Prescott [0m
[33mdiscusses the impact pay has on your organization and employees and shares ways to create a pay strategy that meets [0m
[33myour organizationâ€™s unique needs. You can also hear about three key considerations when designing your strategy that [0m
[33mwill help attract and retain talent. Finally, Lynne offers practical methods you can implement to support the pay [0m
[33mstrategy approval process and ensure your pay strategy is successful.[0m
[33m## Human Resources: Working with Vendors[0m
[33mHR is a big job. Companies of every size rely on vendors to help, whether it's supplying software, training, insurance,[0m
[33mor payroll. After the vendors have been found, it's important to build and maintain good relationships. This course [0m
[33mhelps you understand the ins and outsâ€”and the pros and consâ€”of working with HR vendors. Instructor Gabriella [0m
[33mParente-Neubert reviews the most common types of HR support services that HR teams outsource, from [0m[1;33m401[0m[1;33m([0m[33mk[0m[1;33m)[0m[33m [0m

[33mPlus, get tips for negotiating your vendor contracts and getting the most benefit from the relationship.[0m
[33m## Accounting Foundations: Bookkeeping[0m
[33mBookkeeping is about collecting information, recording events, and organizing those records to make better decisions. [0m
[33mAccountants use the financial transactions recorded in ledgers or books to create a company's income statement and [0m
[33mbalance sheet. In this course, accounting professors Jim and Kay Stice walk you through the four key steps in the [0m
[33mbookkeeping process: analyzing transactions, recording the effects, summarizing the effects, and preparing financial [0m
[33mreports. They explain the components of a journal entryâ€”debits and creditsâ€”and the essential questions a [0m
[33mbookkeeper/accountant asks in reviewing those transactions. They also explain how accountants translate ledger [0m
[33minformation into financial statements and the role of computer programs in helping businesses manage their accounts.[0m

[33mand its applications, from lean accounting to lifecycle costing. Follow a real-world case study showing the insights [0m
[33mgenerated from a critical decision about payroll, and learn how to define the elements that will help you successfully [0m
[33mimplement managerial accounting in the real world. Instructor Joshua Rischin, a management consultant, also provides [0m
[33msome tips on building a successful and sustainable career in managerial accounting.[0m
[33m## Preparing for an Audit[0m
[33mThe success of an audit is measured solely by the opinion of an independent auditor. But preparing the paperwork, [0m
[33mpeople, and processes to support an audit is also crucial to ensure it runs smoothly. In this course, financial expert [0m
[33mJason Schenker explains how preparation, transparency, project management, communication, and feedback integration are [0m
[33mcritical elements of audit success. He introduces a big picture view of an independent audit, the laws and regulations [0m
[33mgoverning the process, and that data you need to gather to make sure everything runs smoothly. Company leaders and [0m
[33mstaff alike can use this course to understand the value of the audit, the information that is important to share, the [0m
[33mroles people play in the process, and what to do with auditor feedback once the audit is [0m

[34m# Curriculum Review: HR Professionals Learning Payroll[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m1[0m[34m. Overall Assessment[0m

[34mThis curriculum partially addresses the needs of HR professionals learning payroll, but has significant gaps and [0m
[34mincludes several courses that are tangential to the core topic. While the [0m[34m"Human Resources: Payroll"[0m[34m course provides a [0m
[34mfoundation, the curriculum overemphasizes general HR systems and vendor management while lacking sufficient depth on [0m
[34mcrucial payroll-specific processes, compliance requirements, and practical implementation. The inclusion of broad [0m
[34maccounting courses without payroll-specific applications further dilutes the focus. This curriculum would benefit from [0m
[34msubstantial restructuring to better serve HR professionals specifically needing to understand and manage payroll [0m
[34mfunctions.[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m2[0m[34m. Detailed Analysis[0m

[34m### a. Topic Coverage[0m

[34mThe curriculum includes some essential payroll topics but lacks comprehensive coverage:[0m

[34m**Strengths:**[0m
[34m- The [0m[34m"Human Resources: Payroll"[0m[34m course covers fundamentals including worker classification, leave types, and payroll [0m
[34msystem selection[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Human Resources: Compensation and Benefits"[0m[34m provides context for how payroll fits within total rewards[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Human Resources: Pay Strategy"[0m[34m addresses important strategic aspects of compensation[0m

[34m**Weaknesses:**[0m
[34m- Limited coverage of payroll tax regulations, calculations, and filing requirements[0m
[34m- Insufficient detail on payroll processing workflows, timekeeping integration, and reporting[0m
[34m- Minimal content on payroll compliance audits specific to HR professionals[0m

[34m### b. Prerequisite and Difficulty Scaffolding[0m

[34mThe curriculum does not effectively build from basics to advanced topics:[0m

[34m- It begins appropriately with [0m[34m"HR: Payroll"[0m[34m as an introduction but then shifts to broader HR systems selection rather [0m
[34mthan deeper payroll knowledge[0m
[34m- The accounting-focused courses appear late in the sequence without clear connection to the earlier HR-focused content[0m
[34m- There's no clear progression from theoretical concepts to practical application for payroll specifically[0m

[34m### c. Course Relevance and Fit[0m

[34mSeveral courses have limited relevance to HR professionals learning payroll:[0m

[34m**Highly Relevant:**[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Human Resources: Payroll"[0m[34m - directly addresses core topic[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Human Resources: Compensation and Benefits"[0m[34m - provides context for payroll within total rewards[0m

[34m**Partially Relevant:**[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Human Resources: Pay Strategy"[0m[34m - addresses compensation philosophy but not payroll mechanics[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Human Resources: Working with Vendors"[0m[34m - relevant only for outsourced payroll services[0m

[34m**Minimally Relevant:**[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Human Resources: Selecting an HR System"[0m[34m - too broad for focused payroll learning[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Accounting Foundations: Bookkeeping"[0m[34m - general accounting principles without payroll focus[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Applying Managerial Accounting"[0m[34m - management insights not specific to payroll functions[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Preparing for an Audit"[0m[34m - general audit preparation rather than payroll-specific compliance[0m

[34m### d. Content Redundancy[0m

[34mThere is minimal harmful redundancy between courses, but some overlap exists:[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"HR: Payroll"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"HR: Compensation and Benefits"[0m[34m likely have overlapping content on pay structures[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"HR: Working with Vendors"[0m[34m and [0m[34m"HR: Selecting an HR System"[0m[34m may have redundant vendor selection processes[0m

[34m### e. Identified Gaps or Missing Topics[0m

[34mCritical payroll-specific topics are absent from this curriculum:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Payroll tax regulations and compliance** - No dedicated coverage of federal, state, and local tax requirements[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Payroll processing workflows** - Limited practical guidance on day-to-day payroll operations[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Payroll technology and software** - Insufficient focus on payroll-specific systems beyond general HRIS selection[0m
[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Payroll reporting and reconciliation** - Missing content on creating and validating payroll reports[0m
[1;34m5[0m[34m. **Special payroll situations** - No coverage of multi-state employees, global payroll, or contract worker payments[0m
[1;34m6[0m[34m. **Payroll security and data protection** - Missing content on securing sensitive payroll information[0m
[1;34m7[0m[34m. **Payroll auditing and compliance** - Needs specific focus on payroll audit preparation and compliance[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m3[0m[34m. Recommendations[0m

[34m### Restructure the Curriculum:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Retain these core courses:**[0m
[34m   - [0m[34m"Human Resources: Payroll"[0m[34m [0m[1;34m([0m[34mmove to first position[0m[1;34m)[0m

[34m# My Learning Journey Through HR Payroll Courses[0m

[34m## Initial Thoughts as an HR Professional[0m

[34mAs someone working in HR who needs to understand payroll better, I'm excited to go through this curriculum. Payroll is [0m
[34moften viewed as complex and technical, but it's essential knowledge for my role. Let me work through these courses to [0m
[34msee what I can learn.[0m

[34m## Human Resources: Payroll[0m

[34m### Introduction[0m
[34mThe course starts with a brief introduction to understanding payroll. This seems like a good foundation, as I need to [0m
[34mgrasp the basics before diving into more complex aspects.[0m

[34m### Setting Up the Payroll Function for Success[0m
[34mThis section opened my eyes to HR's critical role in payroll. I hadn't fully appreciated how central HR is to payroll [0m
[34mfunctions across all business types worldwide. The legal issues section was particularly valuable - learning about [0m
[34mminimum wage requirements, pay cycles, and fair pay laws that vary globally gives me confidence in ensuring compliance.[0m

[34mThe section on choosing a payroll system seems practical and necessary. As someone in HR who might influence system [0m
[34mdecisions, understanding the options available is crucial for making informed recommendations.[0m

[34m### Payroll Fundamentals[0m
[34mWorker classification was eye-opening! The distinction between independent contractors and employees is more complex [0m
[34mthan I initially thought. This knowledge will help me avoid costly misclassification errors.[0m

[34mThe exempt vs. non-exempt employee classification section was particularly relevant. I've always found this area [0m
[34mconfusing, and the detailed explanation helps clarify when overtime pay is required versus when it isn't.[0m

[34mGarnishments and payroll taxes section provided a good overview of mandatory deductions. I now understand better how to[0m
[34mhandle court-ordered deductions and various tax requirements.[0m

[34mThe bonuses and commissions section was helpful for understanding variable compensation components. This knowledge will[0m
[34mbe valuable when explaining compensation packages to employees.[0m

[34m### Payroll Compliance[0m
[34mThe sections on sick/vacation time, benefits, and various leaves [0m[1;34m([0m[34mmaternity/paternity, holiday, jury duty[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m were [0m
[34mcomprehensive. I appreciate the global perspective since companies increasingly operate internationally.[0m

[34mThe pay equity section was particularly timely given current workplace discussions. Understanding how to evaluate and [0m
[34maddress pay disparities is crucial for modern HR professionals.[0m

[34mThe termination and final checks section outlined the strict guidelines around final pay, severance, and COBRA [0m
[34mbenefits. This information is critical as mishandling termination pay can create significant legal exposure.[0m

[34m**Reflection:** This course provided a solid foundation in payroll fundamentals. I feel more confident in understanding[0m
[34mthe technical aspects of payroll and the legal implications of various payroll decisions. The global perspective was [0m
[34mparticularly valuable.[0m

[34m## Human Resources: Compensation and Benefits[0m

[34m### A Strategic Approach to Total Rewards[0m
[34mThis course builds nicely on the payroll course by expanding beyond basic pay to total compensation. I now understand [0m
[34mthat compensation includes both direct pay and benefits, which creates a complete picture of employee rewards.[0m

[34mThe strategic alignment section helped me see how compensation strategy must support overall business goals. This [0m
[34mperspective elevates my thinking from tactical payroll processing to strategic compensation planning.[0m

[34mThe legal framework section reinforced and expanded on the legal knowledge from the payroll course, covering FLSA, [0m
[34mEqual Pay Act, Title VII, and FMLA in greater detail.[0m

[34m### Pay Structures[0m
[34mThe sections on internal alignment, organization-specific pay, and job-based versus person-based pay structures were [0m
[34milluminating. I now understand different approaches to structuring pay:[0m
[34m- Job evaluation approaches that rank positions[0m
[34m- Skill-based plans that pay for capabilities[0m
[34m- Competency-based plans that reward behaviors of high performers[0m

[34mThis builds on the basic payroll knowledge by explaining WHY we pay what we pay, not just HOW to process payments.[0m

[34m### Paying for Performance[0m
[34mThe performance review process and incentive plans sections connected well with the earlier courses. Now I see how [0m
[34mperformance assessment feeds into compensation decisions and can drive organizational performance.[0m

[34mThe executive compensation section was entirely new to me and filled a knowledge gap about how senior leaders are [0m
[34mcompensated differently through the tournament model.[0m

[34m### Employee Benefits[0m
[34mThis section expanded significantly on the benefits briefly mentioned in the payroll course. Learning about benefit [0m
[34mplanning, legally required benefits, insurance options, retirement plans, and time-off policies gave me a comprehensive[0m
[34munderstanding of the non-cash components of compensation.[0m

[34m### HR Technology, International Compensation, and Benefits[0m
[34mThe HR technology section connected well with the payroll systems section from the first course, emphasizing how [0m
[34mtechnology facilitates both payroll processing and strategic compensation management.[0m

[34mThe international compensation section expanded on the global perspective mentioned throughout the courses, [0m
[34mparticularly addressing expatriate compensation challenges.[0m

[34m### Managing a Total Rewards System[0m
[34mThe final section tied everything together by explaining how to budget for and communicate about total rewards. The [0m
[34memphasis on creating a coherent strategy helps me see how all these components work together.[0m

[34m**Reflection:** This course significantly deepened my understanding beyond basic payroll processing to strategic [0m
[34mcompensation planning. I now see how payroll fits into the broader context of total rewards.[0m

[34m## Human Resources: Pay Strategy[0m

[34m### Your Pay Strategy[0m
[34mThis course elevates my thinking to an even more strategic level. It focuses on how pay decisions impact talent [0m
[34macquisition, retention, and organizational success. This builds directly on the previous courses but with greater [0m
[34memphasis on strategy development.[0m

[34m### Pay as a Tool for Success[0m
[34mThe sections on talent attraction and performance link pay directly to critical business outcomes. This helps me [0m
[34munderstand how to use compensation as a strategic lever, not just an administrative function.[0m

[34m### Elements of Pay and Rewards[0m
[34mThe detailed examination of base pay and variable pay builds on concepts from previous courses but provides more [0m
[34mimplementation guidance. I now understand not just what these pay elements are, but how to determine which ones are [0m
[34mappropriate for specific organizational contexts.[0m

[34m### Building the Pay Strategy[0m
[34mThe step-by-step approach to building and implementing a pay strategy is extremely practical. This gives me actionable [0m
[34mguidance for developing my organization's approach to compensation.[0m

[34m**Reflection:** This course helped me connect payroll knowledge and compensation concepts to strategic business [0m
[34mobjectives. I now understand how to develop a coherent pay strategy that supports organizational goals.[0m

[34m## Human Resources: Working with Vendors[0m

[34m### Who Are Vendors?[0m
[34mThis course introduces a completely new dimension: outsourcing payroll and benefits administration. Understanding when [0m
[34mto use vendors for HR functions like payroll, benefits, workers' compensation, retirement plans, and employee [0m
[34massistance programs is valuable knowledge.[0m

[34m### What Vendors Does HR Use?[0m
[34mThe deep dive into specific types of HR vendors and common problems is practical information that wasn't covered in [0m
[34mprevious courses. This fills a gap in my knowledge about managing external relationships.[0m

[34m### Why Use Vendors?[0m
[34mLearning the pros and cons of using vendors, how to select the right vendors, and how to manage vendor relationships [0m
[34mprovides practical guidance for outsourcing decisions.[0m

[34m**Reflection:** This course addresses the increasingly common practice of outsourcing payroll and benefits [0m
[34madministration. It provides guidance on when and how to effectively use vendors, which complements the internal payroll[0m
[34mknowledge from previous courses.[0m

[34m## Accounting Foundations: Bookkeeping[0m

[34m### Review of the Financial Statements[0m
[34mThis course shifts perspective from HR to accounting fundamentals. Understanding balance sheets, income statements, and[0m
[34mcash flow statements provides context for how payroll impacts overall financial reporting.[0m

[34m### Four Steps in the Bookkeeping Process[0m
[34mLearning about the accounting equation, debits and credits, and transaction categorization helps me understand the [0m
[34mlanguage accounting uses to track payroll expenses. This gives me insight into how payroll transactions impact [0m
[34mfinancial statements.[0m

[34m### How Transactions Affect the Accounting Equation[0m
[34mThe detailed examples of recording transactions, including payroll-related entries like paying wages and benefits, [0m
[34mhelps me understand how payroll activities are represented in accounting records.[0m

[34m### The General Ledger and Accounting Cycle[0m
[34mUnderstanding how transactions flow through the accounting system from journal entries to ledgers to financial [0m
[34mstatements gives me insight into where payroll data goes after I process it.[0m

[34m**Reflection:** This course provides the accounting perspective on payroll, helping me understand how payroll decisions[0m
[34mand transactions impact an organization's financial reporting. This broadens my perspective beyond HR to see payroll's [0m
[34mrole in overall financial management.[0m

[34m## Overall Reflections on the Curriculum[0m

[34m### Knowledge Progression[0m
[34mI appreciate how the curriculum builds knowledge systematically:[0m
[1;34m1[0m[34m. Starting with basic payroll processing and compliance[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. Expanding to comprehensive compensation and benefits[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. Elevating to strategic pay planning[0m
[1;34m4[0m[34m. Adding vendor management perspective[0m
[1;34m5[0m[34m. Concluding with accounting context[0m

[34m### Integration of Knowledge[0m
[34mThe courses connect well, with each building on previous concepts while introducing new dimensions. The progression [0m
[34mfrom tactical payroll knowledge to strategic compensation planning to financial impact provides a well-rounded [0m
[34meducation.[0m

[34m### Gaps and Confusion[0m
[34mI noticed some potential gaps in the curriculum:[0m
[34m- Limited coverage of international payroll compliance beyond general principles[0m
[34m- Minimal discussion of payroll technology implementation and change management[0m
[34m- Limited coverage of payroll audits and risk management[0m

[34m### Key Takeaways[0m
[34mAs an HR professional focused on payroll, this curriculum has:[0m
[1;34m1[0m[34m. Enhanced my technical knowledge of payroll processing[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. Broadened my understanding of compensation strategy[0m

[1;34m4[0m[34m. Introduced vendor management considerations[0m
[1;34m5[0m[34m. Provided accounting context for payroll activities[0m

[34mI now have a much more comprehensive understanding of payroll beyond just the mechanics of processing paychecks. I see [0m

[34m# Curriculum Review: LLM Techniques for Data Scientists and ML Experts[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m1[0m[34m. Overall Assessment[0m

[34mThis curriculum offers a solid foundation in modern LLM techniques for data scientists and ML experts. It covers essential topics from mathematical foundations through advanced fine-tuning[0m
[34mand deployment, with a logical progression from theory to practical application. The curriculum is largely appropriate for the target audience, though there are some gaps in cutting-edge [0m
[34mtopics and advanced techniques that would benefit experienced ML practitioners. Overall, it provides a comprehensive introduction to LLMs with practical implementation guidance, but could [0m
[34mbe enhanced with additional content on emerging techniques and more advanced deployment scenarios.[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m2[0m[34m. Detailed Analysis[0m

[34m### a. Topic Coverage[0m

[34mThe curriculum covers several critical aspects of LLM technology:[0m

[34m- Mathematical foundations of transformers and attention mechanisms[0m
[34m- Chatbot development using contemporary frameworks[0m
[34m- Fine-tuning techniques including PEFT and LoRA[0m
[34m- Reinforcement learning foundations[0m
[34m- Model deployment and monitoring[0m

[34mThese topics provide a well-rounded view of the LLM landscape, from theoretical underpinnings to practical implementation. The inclusion of reinforcement learning is particularly valuable [0m
[34mgiven its importance in techniques like RLHF [0m[1;34m([0m[34mReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m, though this specific application to LLMs could be more explicit.[0m

[34m### b. Prerequisite and Difficulty Scaffolding[0m

[34mThe curriculum demonstrates thoughtful scaffolding:[0m

[34m- It begins with foundational mathematics and progressively moves to practical applications[0m
[34m- Course prerequisites are explicitly stated in some courses [0m[1;34m([0m[34me.g., [0m[34m"AI Workshop: Advanced Chatbot Development"[0m[34m requires Python, ML concepts, TensorFlow/Keras[0m[1;34m)[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Fine-Tuning for LLMs"[0m[34m builds on the foundational knowledge established in earlier courses[0m
[34m- The MLOps course appropriately appears later, suggesting a deployment phase after model understanding[0m

[34mThe progression from foundational math to specific techniques like LoRA and finally to deployment represents a logical learning path. However, the relationship between the Reinforcement [0m
[34mLearning course and the other LLM-specific courses could be more clearly defined.[0m

[34m### c. Course Relevance and Fit[0m

[34mMost courses are highly relevant to the target audience:[0m

[34m- [0m[34m"Foundational Math for Generative AI"[0m[34m provides necessary mathematical background for ML experts to understand LLM internals[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"Fine-Tuning for LLMs"[0m[34m directly addresses a critical skill for adapting pre-trained models[0m
[34m- [0m[34m"MLOps Essentials"[0m[34m covers the operational aspects of deploying models to production[0m

[34mThe [0m[34m"Reinforcement Learning Foundations"[0m[34m course, while valuable, seems somewhat disconnected from the LLM-specific focus. While reinforcement learning is used in LLM training [0m[1;34m([0m[34mparticularly[0m
[34mfor alignment[0m[1;34m)[0m[34m, the course description doesn't explicitly connect RL to LLM applications like RLHF, which would make its inclusion more clearly relevant.[0m

[34m### d. Content Redundancy[0m

[34mSeveral potential gaps exist in the curriculum:[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Technical implementation details**: Limited coverage of specific AI tools and platforms project managers should know[0m
[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Data requirements**: Insufficient focus on the data needed to effectively implement AI in project contexts[0m
[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Team management**: Limited discussion on managing teams with mixed AI/human components[0m
[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Cost considerations**: Minimal coverage of budget implications for AI implementation[0m
[1;34m5[0m[34m. **Case studies**: Could benefit from more extended real-world implementation examples[0m
[1;34m6[0m[34m. **Practical exercises**: No clear hands-on component for learners to apply knowledge[0m

[34m## [0m[1;34m3[0m[34m. Recommendations[0m

[34m### Curriculum Structure Improvements[0m

[1;34m1[0m[34m. **Reordering**: [0m
[34m   - Keep [0m[34m"Everyday AI Concepts"[0m[34m as the first course[0m
[34m   - Consolidate Ricardo Vargas's courses or ensure clear differentiation between them[0m
[34m   - Move [0m[34m"Thriving as a Project Manager in the Age of AI"[0m[34m to the final position to end with career strategy[0m

[1;34m2[0m[34m. **Content Additions**:[0m
[34m   - Add a hands-on course focused on specific AI tools used in project management[0m
[34m   - Include a course or module on data management for AI-powered project management[0m
[34m   - Incorporate more case studies of successful AI implementation in diverse project environments[0m

[1;34m3[0m[34m. **Content Removals/Consolidations**:[0m
[34m   - Consider consolidating the two Ricardo Vargas courses to reduce redundancy[0m
[34m   - Streamline introductory AI concepts across courses to avoid repetition[0m

[1;34m4[0m[34m. **Specific Recommendations**:[0m
[34m   - Add a course on budgeting and resource planning for AI implementation in projects[0m
[34m   - Include content on change management specifically for teams adopting AI tools[0m
[34m   - Develop a module on evaluating AI solutions and vendors for project management contexts[0m
