 \\n The second risk is thinking too small.  \\n All the initiatives that are on your list are really small,  \\n incremental improvements to your business  \\n and don't really advance you to your strategic goals.  \\n A third is thinking too big.  \\n All the initiatives are huge, and everything has to line up  \\n perfectly, and it's a really large bet that you're taking  \\n with the organization.  \\n Sometimes you can do what I call starving the kids.  \\n Many organizations have a large profitable business unit,  \\n and then they have a lot of smaller ideas  \\n that are going to be more rapid growth.  \\n And the risk is you invest all your resources in the big  \\n known business and you starve those smaller businesses.  \\n The problem is you're starving your future in doing so.  \\n And, lastly, I call it the random initiative generator.  \\n You look at all your initiatives, and they all seem  \\n really great, but when you try to figure out  \\n where they're taking you, there's no clear direction.  \\n An example I've seen when I worked  \\n in a strategic planning group,  \\n and I first arrived in the group.  \\n I said, \\\"Let me see our strategic plan.\\\"  \\n I was handed a list of 37 acquisition targets,  \\n and I said, \\\"This is great.  \\n \\\"These all look like interesting companies  \\n \\\"that we should think about pursuing, but where's the plan?\\\"  \\n Well, that's the plan.  \\n It wasn't a plan.  \\n It was a random list of companies that competed  \\n in the market we were in, and we didn't know  \\n which of those acquisitions was going to be attractive  \\n and which ones were distractions.  \\n And our first task was fixing  \\n that strategic planning process, setting direction  \\n and putting some focus to the initiatives that we pursue.  \\n So take a look at your strategic planning process.  \\n Ask yourself if you're showing some of these symptoms  \\n and make sure you set direction so that you can pursue  \\n initiatives that will add value  \\n and help you reach your destination.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2273518\",\"duration\":134,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Strategic planning process: Overview\",\"fileName\":\"183682_01_03_MM30_Run_2020Q1\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn what the basic needs of a strategic planning process are so you can ensure your endeavors are properly resourced.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":10007830,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Strategic planning is an inherently simple process.  \\n There are some major tools and steps  \\n that you're going to follow  \\n as you pull together your strategic plan.  \\n First, you need to set direction and stay in a lane.  \\n That begins with articulating the vision, the mission  \\n and the goals of the organization.  \\n Once you've set that destination,  \\n it's important to define  \\n the organization's core competencies.  \\n What are you great at?

 \\n Because if you have clear guiding principles,  \\n the actions they're going to take will be consistent  \\n with the direction of the organization,  \\n which ultimately helps you achieve that vision and mission.  \\n In terms of your goals,  \\n you're going to set out those metrics,  \\n those things that after a year, two years, five years,  \\n you'll look back and say, we achieved those goals.  \\n Try to make them as measurable as possible.  \\n It can be a dollar, how much revenue, how much profit.  \\n It can be a number of new customers that you add.  \\n Those guiding principles and goals need to be clear enough  \\n that they guide behavior,  \\n help people behave in a manner that's consistent  \\n with the organization's mission,  \\n and those goals should be driving you  \\n to achieving your vision over time.  \\n They need to be aggressive and pragmatic  \\n so you get that balance of I know I can achieve this,  \\n but I'm not really quite sure how I can get there  \\n so I need to innovate and push to be able to do so.  \\n Let me share some ideas  \\n around what guiding principles can be.  \\n I've worked with many organizations around the world  \\n to define what they want  \\n in terms of behavior from their associates.  \\n Some guiding principles I've heard that are great  \\n are things like, \\\"Would I give this to my family?\\\"  \\n The organization was in the consumer packaged goods industry  \\n and when people were trying to figure out  \\n whether they make an ingredient change to a product  \\n or a packaging change to the product,  \\n they asked their people to step back and say,  \\n if you made that change,  \\n would you be comfortable giving that product to your family?  \\n If the answer was yes, go ahead and make the change.  \\n If the answer's no, stop immediately.  \\n Other guiding principles I've heard.  \\n \\\"Be net exporters of talent.\\\"  \\n This is how we want our managers  \\n in the organization to behave.  \\n Being a net exporter of talent means bringing people in,  \\n helping them develop, helping them grow, challenging them,  \\n and building their skills and then,  \\n once they've reached that next level,  \\n push them off to the next team.  \\n Send them to the next great opportunity in front of them.  \\n And then, bring in more people behind them,  \\n and the net effect of that is you're generating more talent  \\n for the organization than you're bringing in.  \\n Now, think of the behaviors  \\n that this can lead managers to take.  \\n They won't hoard talent anymore.  \\n The notion that I've build somebody  \\n and they're a high performer, but you know what,  \\n I'm going to discourage them from going to the great new role,  \\n would run counter to this guiding principle.  \\n So, by putting this principle in place,  \\n that organization is going to achieve that goal  \\n of having a more talented organization.  \\n So, think about what you want your organization to look like  \\n in the future, how do you want your associates to behave,  \\n and then be able to put in place a principle  \\n that they can understand when they're faced with a decision.  \\n Now, in terms of goals,  \\n laying those out very clearly  \\n and then sharing them across the organization,  \\n but letting the organization figure out how to get there.  \\n I've been in organizations where we had revenue targets  \\n or retention targets.  \\n My organization today, I lay out a goal for myself.  \\n Every year, I want this many more client logos  \\n on our website,  \\n so I want to force us to get out of the comfort zone  \\n of serving clients that we currently serve,  \\n which is great and we love doing,  \\n but we need to continue to grow  \\n so I want new logos on the website.  \\n When we land a new client, we add a logo to the website,  \\n and that's a metric that I track  \\n because it helps me achieve my vision  \\n for our organization down the road.  \\n So, think about what the goals are of your organization.  \\n What's the vision, where are you trying to go,  \\n and what set of goals will help you get there?

resources\\nto pursue those initiatives and reach those goals.\\n\\nWhy is a Strategic Plan so important?\\nFirst, it provides focus for you efforts\\nand your limited investments.\\nIt gives your team something to rally around\\nand be excited about.\\nAnd lastly, it helps you identify the risks\\nand opportunities you're going to face in the market,\\nand then plan for those risks\\nor exploit those opportunities.\\nThere are three principles of strategic planning\\nthat you should follow.\\nFirst, set a clear direction and stay in your lane,\\nversus meandering and pursuing strategies\\nthat change every year.\\n\\nSecond, say \\\"no\\\" to distractions.\\nIt's very easy to get caught up in the\\n\\\"Wow, that looks like a cool initiative,\\n\\\"let's pursue that!\\\"\\nThe third is making sure you diversify your bets.\\nYou have limited pools of money,\\nand people, and time,\\nmaking sure you don't put all your eggs in one basket,\\nand instead pursue initiatives\\nthat are spread across different time horizons,\\ndifferent markets, and different products.\\n\\nAnd if you follow these three principles\\nof strategic planning,\\nyou're going to have a clear direction\\nthat you're able to follow over time\\nand achieve your goals.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:384106\",\"duration\":186,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Avoiding major strategic planning

How are they distributed by marketshare?\\nHow do they go to market? What are their core competencies?\\nSecond, look at the threats of new entry.\\n\\nSo there's the existing set of competitors.\\nAre there new competitors who will enter the market?\\nEvaluate how much does it take to get into the market.\\nWill I have to build huge factories?\\nOr can I just launch a website to compete against you?\\nSo understanding those threats of new entry.\\nNext, look at the threat of substitution.\\nYou have your products.\\nWhat other products could meet that need\\nfor your customers?\\nUnderstand what customers are buying,\\nnot necessarily what you're selling.\\n\\nThen you have to evaluate buyer power.\\nSo these are your customers buying from you.\\nAre you the big player in the market?\\nOr are your customers?\\nFor my firm, there's a great deal of buyer power.\\nI sell to large companies and I'm a small training firm.\\nSo there's a lot more buyer power that I have to deal with.\\nNext, you need to look at supplier power.\\nThe people who are providing raw materials and inputs\\nto your business.\\n\\nAre they big? Are they small?\\nHow much power do they have from a pricing standpoint?\\nAnd by looking at all five of these dynamics,\\nyou'll be able to identify, where are the major threats.\\nWhere are the opportunities that we can pursue?\\nAnd it can generate some interesting insights when you're\\nrigorous about going through this process.\\nWhen I worked at Scotts Miracle-Gro,\\nwe were going through our strategic planning process\\nand as we were looking at the threats of substitution,\\nour CEO came up with a very interesting insight.\\n\\nWe were in the lawn and garden industry\\nand we sold lawn and garden products to consumers.\\nWhen we looked at the threat of substitution,\\nthe entire team was saying, well the substitutes\\nare our competitors, lawn and garden products.\\nOur CEO said, \\\"No actually, Google and YouTube\\n'are the threats of substitutes.\\\"\\nWe all scratched our heads and said, \\\"What do you mean?\\\"\\nHe said, \\\"What we're really competing for\\n'is the consumer's time.\\n'And is that consumer going to spend\\n'their discretionary time in their garden,\\n'working on their trees and shrubs and lawn,\\n'or are they going to spend their time\\n'on YouTube and Google and the Internet?\\\"\\nAnd it was a very clear picture\\nof where the threat came from.\\n\\nAnd it led us to approach our business very differently.\\nSo by doing this

\\\"Would I give this to my family?\\\"\\nThe organization was in the\\nconsumer packaged goods industry.\\n\\nWhen people were trying to figure out whether\\nthey make an ingredient change to a product,\\nor a packaging change to the product,\\nthey asked their people to step back and say,\\n\\\"If you made that change would you be\\n\\\"comfortable giving that product to your family?\\\"\\nIf the answer was yes, go ahead and make the change.\\nIf the answer's no, stop immediately.\\nOther guiding principles I've heard,\\n\\\"Be net exporters of talent.\\\"\\nThis is how we want our managers\\nin the organization to behave.\\nBeing a net exporter of talent means bringing people in,\\nhelping them develop, helping them grow,\\nchallenging them, and building their skills,\\nand then once they've reached that next level\\npush them off to the next team.\\n\\nSend them to the next great opportunity in front of them,\\nand then bring in more people behind them,\\nand the net effect of that is you're generating more\\ntalent for the organization than you're bringing in.\\nNow, think of the behaviors that this\\ncan lead managers to take.\\nThey won't hoard talent anymore,\\nthe notion that I've built somebody\\nand they're a high performer,\\nbut you know what I'm going to discourage them\\nfrom going to the great new role,\\nwould run counter to this guiding principle.\\n\\nBy putting this principle in place that organization\\nis going to achieve that goal\\nof having a more talented organization.\\nThink about what you want your organization\\nto look like in the future.\\nHow do you want your associates to behave,\\nand then be able to put in place a principle\\nthat they can understand when they're faced with a decision.\\nNow in terms of goals, laying those out very clearly,\\nand then sharing them across the organization,\\nbut letting the organization figure out how to get there.\\n\\nI've been in organizations where we had revenue targets,\\nor retention targets, my organization today\\nI lay out a goal for myself every year\\nI want this many more client logos on our website.\\nI want to force us to get out of the comfort zone\\nof serving clients that we currently serve,\\nwhich is great and we love doing,\\nbut we need to continue to grow\\nso I want new logos on the website.\\nWhen we land a new client we add a logo to the website,\\nand that's a metric that I track,\\nbecause it helps me achieve my vision\\nfor our organization down the road.\\n\\nThink about what the goals are of your organization,\\nwhat's the vision, where are you trying to go,\\nand what set of goals will help you get there,\\nand by articulating them clearly the organization\\nis going to drive in the right direction.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

I run out of those resources,\\nI should not be pursuing any initiatives\\nthat are below that line because it's going\\nto dilute my efforts and reduce my possibility of success.\\nSo, for example, if my limiting factor was budget,\\nand I only had $500,000 to invest,\\nI would start at the top of prioritization list\\nand look at the cost of the initiative,\\nand work down until I ran out of money.\\n\\nIn this case, I would have to stop\\nafter initiative C\\nbecause I will have spent my $500,000.\\nI should not work on anything below that line\\nuntil I get additional budget\\nor we decide, as an organization,\\nto re-prioritize something and move something\\nfrom above the line below it,\\nand move something from below above.\\nBut that requires a re-prioritization.\\nAnother example might be\\na functional resource as my limiting factor.\\n\\nSo, let's say I only have one marketing person on my team\\nand budget is not a constraint.\\nAgain, I start at the top of the list with my resources.\\nMy highest priority initiative\\nI can assign my marketing person\\nand then my second highest priority initiative.\\nBut then I run out of marketing people.\\nI don't have additional resources available\\nto pursue that next initiative.\\nSo, in that case, I need to draw the line\\nafter my second initiative,\\nand I would not pursue the third one\\nuntil I got additional marketing support.\\n\\nAnother example, let's say sales was my limiting factor,\\nand I have 10 sales people.\\nAgain, I start at the top of the list\\nand I start working down.\\nI can say this one requires sales,\\nso does this one, so does this one,\\nand by the time I get down here\\nthat's when I run out of sales resources.\\nSo, I would pursue all of the initiatives on the list\\nuntil the point where I run out of sales people.\\nSo, as you look at your prioritization list,\\nand you have them sorted from highest to lowest,\\nand you understand the resources\\nthat will

list.\\nInitiative F is reasonably low profit\\nbut it's gonna enter a new market\\nand help me grow quickly.\\n\\nInitiative G doesn't deliver very much profit at all\\nand there's virtually no

Strategic plans can be complicated\\nbecause you're trying to drive multiple objective functions.\\nSo it's important, once you've built your priority list,\\nto make sure that you have balance across all of the\\nobjectives you're trying to achieve.\\nThe way I like to do that is to create multiple looks\\nthrough a two-by-two matrix and see where my\\nhighest priority initiatives are showing up on that matrix.\\nSo for example, let's say I've got 30 initiatives\\non my entire list and five of them\\nare my top priority initiatives.\\n\\nSo first, I evaluate them based upon growth rate,\\nhow fast will they help my company grow,\\nand profitability, how profitable is this initiative,\\nthis particular product.\\nAnd when I plot all 30 initiatives,\\nthose five top initiatives help us grow very rapidly\\nand they're very high on that axis\\nand they're very profitable,\\nso they're very high on that axis.\\nAnd looking at the portfolio through that lens\\nof growth rate and profitability makes sense.\\n\\nBut we're not done.\\nNow let's look at other objectives that we have,\\nand we may have two other strategic objectives\\nof growing internationally and selling premium products\\nas opposed to commodity products.\\nI then take that same list of 30 initiatives\\nand I plot them on that two-by-two matrix.\\nAnd what I might notice is, those five top priority\\ninitiatives end up really low on the\\ngrows internationally axis because they're all\\nfocused on our home country.\\n\\nI may also look at those top five products and say,\\n\\\"Wow, these are all commodity products.\\n\\\"They're not premium products so they score\\n\\\"low on that as well.\\\"\\nAnd initiatives that were my top five,\\nnow show up very low on my other strategic objectives.\\nWhat I need to do then, is get my portfolio in balance,\\nand I might say, those five initiatives are great\\nfrom a growth and profitability standpoint,\\nnot so great from an international growth,\\nand from a differentiation standpoint.\\n\\nSo instead of doing all five, I'll do two,\\nand then I'm going to go pick three other initiatives\\nthat help me grow internationally and that help me\\nlaunch premium products to get my portfolio more in balance.\\nSo once you have your list of initiatives,\\nand you've prioritized them, go back to your\\nstrategic objectives, build some two-by-two matrices,\\nand look at that portfolio through multiple lenses,\\nand when you see it unbalanced, spend some time\\nre-balancing that list of initiatives so you can drive\\nall of your strategic objectives at the same time.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:384132\",\"duration\":123,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Assessing initiatives over

Why?  \\n Because of the aggressive entry of Japanese car makers  \\n into the US market,  \\n led by Toyota.  \\n Cars are big, heavy,  \\n and expensive to ship around in large numbers.  \\n That's one of the reasons the US market was caught off guard  \\n when Toyota started sending Japanese-made cars  \\n in the US at lower prices than they could match.  \\n Their production processes were so efficient  \\n and lean that they managed to beat US car makers  \\n at their own game.  \\n So you can see how Toyota offers  \\n an excellent example of cost leadership.  \\n Then we've got differentiation strategy.  \\n This is about doing something no one else can do.  \\n Airbnb is a great story of differentiation strategy  \\n because it has changed the way we travel.  \\n It's co-founders, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia,  \\n started out by renting three air mattresses  \\n on their apartment floor.  \\n They made $80 per guest.  \\n It seemed like a great idea for a startup.  \\n So they launched a website  \\n and invited other people  \\n to list their own mattresses for hire.  \\n Brian and Joe took their cameras  \\n and visited every one of their New York City listings.  \\n They persuade the owners to let them take lots  \\n of photographs of their place.  \\n They've uploaded them to the website.  \\n And within a month of starting  \\n this strategy sales double, then tripled.  \\n The rest is history.  \\n Last is focus strategy.  \\n This is about doing something that caters  \\n to specific needs of a targeted consumer group.  \\n A great example of a focus strategy is IKEA.  \\n IKEA offers their customers low prices,  \\n great variety of stylish products, no delivery,  \\n no consultants, and no furniture assembly.  \\n With these competitive elements of their strategy,  \\n they target a specific group of people.  \\n Young people who want stylist design and good quality,  \\n but don't want to pay too much for furniture.  \\n IKEA's strategy lets the company focus  \\n on their specific audience.  \\n Michael Porter recommends that every organization  \\n should pursue only one of these strategies.  \\n And so the essence of strategies  \\n making the tough decision of where to focus.  \\n One of my former professors from Salt Bay Business School,  \\n an expert in strategy once told me,  \\n if you are discussing strategy in a meeting  \\n and the discussion is not uncomfortable,  \\n you're not really doing strategy.  \\n Taking strategic decisions is always painful.  \\n My goal is to help you make the implementation  \\n of strategy less painful.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3093468\",\"duration\":197,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"What is strategy implementation?\",\"fileName\":\"2480460_en_US_00_03_LA30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about what strategy implementation is and how to identify the most common implementation pitfalls.

 \\n How 'about speed of collecting cash from customers?  \\n - [Man With Glasses] The reporting challenge  \\n in an organization is to identify the key measures,  \\n to organize them into a framework  \\n that makes them easy to remember and to understand,  \\n and then to design a performance evaluation system  \\n that will give people in the organization  \\n an incentive to pay attention to those measures.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3020478\",\"duration\":166,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Technology's impact on KPIs\",\"fileName\":\"428726_en_US_01_02_2021Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, explore examples of a freight train company and storage space on an information disk and identify top key performance indicators and their importance.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":8805566,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - In the 1870s, Albert Fink was an executive  \\n for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.  \\n The financial panic of 1873  \\n placed financial stress on the railroad  \\n and caused Mr. Fink to look closely  \\n at railroad cost.  \\n He focused on just a few key measures,  \\n the most prominent being the cost-per-ton mile,  \\n the cost of shipping one ton of freight one mile.  \\n Mr. Fink found that this cost very dramatically,  \\n from as low as 1/7 of a cent for high volume freight  \\n carried against the normal flow of traffic  \\n in cars that otherwise would be returning empty,  \\n to 73 cents for freight carried in small quantities  \\n in the busiest sections of the railroad.  \\n In other words, it cost 500 times as much  \\n to ship some freight, 500 times.  \\n So Mr. Fink focused on this one number,  \\n this key performance indicator, or KPI,  \\n as he organized operations  \\n in the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.  \\n These days, this relaxing notion  \\n of running an organization  \\n by focusing on one single measure  \\n has been overwhelmed by the quantity of data  \\n that we have available.  \\n Now in my lifetime,  \\n which I admit is quite long,  \\n the cost of data gathering, analysis, and communication  \\n has plummeted dramatically.  \\n For example, in 1972, my father's office  \\n bought two new information storage disks.  \\n These disks were about a meter in diameter  \\n and one centimeter thick.  \\n The storage capacity of these disks,  \\n five megabytes, yeah, five megabytes.  \\n Cost, $5,000.  \\n At the time, a person could buy a new car for $2,000.  \\n So in 1972, it cost the equivalent  \\n of the price of 2-1/2 new cars  \\n to by five megabytes of storage capacity.  \\n Now how much would it cost today  \\n to buy a thumb drive holding five megabytes?

 \\n The consensus seems to be that the number of KPIs  \\n should be somewhere between 10 and 20.  \\n Yes, this is more than Professor Miller's seven,  \\n plus or minus two,  \\n but here we're taking advantage of the fact  \\n that we can write these numbers down  \\n or put them on a computer screen  \\n so that they don't have to be stored  \\n in the short-term memory of our brain.  \\n With too few KPIs,  \\n you're missing measurements  \\n that can tell you something important  \\n about your complex organization.  \\n You're like the pilots in our example,  \\n who want to try to fly the plane  \\n by looking at just one instrument reading.  \\n But with too many KPIs,  \\n you are overwhelming the human brain.  \\n And an overwhelmed brain tends  \\n to just start blocking things out randomly.  \\n It is better to strategically go through a set  \\n of potential KPIs  \\n and identify the most important ones rather than have  \\n a manager's overwhelmed brain randomly focus on a few items.  \\n So what's the best number of KPIs?

 \\n For example, for Walmart, this number is 4.  \\n For Microsoft, it's 25.  \\n These companies track these numbers from year to year  \\n and also benchmark with their competitors.  \\n Another financial measure, average collection period.  \\n How many days does it take a company  \\n to collect its cash from its credit customers?  \\n If that number's too big,  \\n meaning that the collection period is too long,  \\n then cash that could be used to pay bills  \\n is still in the pockets of the customers.  \\n This increases the need for short-term borrowing  \\n and raises the cost of doing business.  \\n Another financial measure, sales per square foot.  \\n How efficiently is a retailer  \\n using its floor space to generate sales?  \\n Another measure, current ratio,  \\n defined as current assets,  \\n such as cash and inventory,  \\n divided by current liabilities,  \\n which are short-term obligations,  \\n such as amounts owed to suppliers.  \\n This is a traditional liquidity measure,  \\n reflecting a company's ability  \\n to meet its obligations in the short-term.  \\n Another financial measure, debt ratio,  \\n defined as total liabilities  \\n divided by total assets,  \\n and interpreted as the fraction of total financing  \\n that has been obtained through borrowing.  \\n Now for most large companies,  \\n this debt ratio number is between 50 and 60%.  \\n Much higher than this,  \\n and the company is at risk  \\n of not being able to repay all of its lenders.  \\n Another financial measure, return on equity,  \\n often called ROE,  \\n defined as net income divided by owner investment.  \\n This is the number of dollars of profit generated  \\n for each $100 of owner investment.  \\n Now for a great company, this number is 20% or more.  \\n For a poor company, it's less than 10%.  \\n Now a little side comment here,  \\n my brother Jim and I  \\n have an entire course devoted to financial ratios.  \\n The course is titled \\\"Running a Profitable Business:  \\n Understanding Financial Ratios.\\\"  \\n Hey, take a look.  \\n Now, viewed more broadly, however,  \\n some companies may wish to do more  \\n than just maximize owner profits.  \\n For example, the traditional German concept  \\n of (speaking foreign language), or prudence,  \\n is based on the idea  \\n that the company should be operated  \\n for the benefit of all stakeholders,  \\n owners, employees, banks,  \\n local communities, and so forth.  \\n The balance scorecard is flexible enough  \\n to include measures that draw attention  \\n to all of these stakeholders.  \\n Now one of my colleagues, Kirill Novoselov,  \\n is doing research based on the idea  \\n of maximizing the ability of a company  \\n to survive in the long-term.  \\n His insight is that, in the long-term,  \\n only the companies that are able to survive  \\n through the bad times  \\n are going to be around to generate profits.  \\n So he and his colleagues are looking at financial measures  \\n such as the amounts that a company spends  \\n on capital improvements,  \\n and the amount it spends on research and development.  \\n They are finding that these companies  \\n that seem to be sacrificing  \\n short-term profits and cash flows  \\n appear to be more robust  \\n and profitable in the long-term.  \\n Now the key point is this:  \\n As part of a strategic planning process,  \\n a company needs to determine  \\n exactly what its financial goals are,  \\n maximize short-term profits,  \\n increase long-run survivability,  \\n or whatever else.  \\n And then design measures that will help  \\n in monitoring progress towards these financial goals.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3022474\",\"duration\":220,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Customer needs and satisfaction\",\"fileName\":\"428726_en_US_02_04_2021Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"A key to strong financial performance is identifying customer needs and satisfying them.

The internal processes measures  \\n in the balance scorecard framework,  \\n help managers monitor how the business is actually working.  \\n Let's organize these internal processes measures  \\n into three groups, innovation measures,  \\n operations measures, and service after sale measures.  \\n Innovation process measures reflect the process  \\n of identifying and creating new products.  \\n For many companies, innovation is where  \\n much of a company's competitive edge is created.  \\n It is important to the ultimate financial success  \\n of the organization that the critical effort  \\n to identify and develop new products and services  \\n is effectively managed.  \\n For example, for companies operating  \\n in rapidly evolving markets,  \\n a discipline of spending money on research  \\n and development is crucial.  \\n So one innovation process measure might be,  \\n the percentage of revenue spent on R and D.  \\n For many companies,  \\n this percentage is remarkably stable from year to year  \\n reflecting a company decision  \\n to keep plowing money back into R and D.  \\n For example, I happen to have this measure  \\n for several companies for 2012.  \\n During 2012, Intel spent 19% of its revenue on R and D,  \\n and Intel consistently spends that high amount.  \\n For Microsoft, the number was 13%.  \\n Again, Microsoft consistently spends that high amount  \\n on research and development.  \\n This measurement reflects a key change in perspective,  \\n spending money on R and D is not a negative it's a positive,  \\n these balanced scorecard measures remind managers  \\n that money must be consistently spent on key items  \\n in order to keep the company alive and growing.  \\n Without this perspective,  \\n the accountants and the budget cutters,  \\n which slash R and D spending  \\n at the first sign of a temporary decline of profits.  \\n And by so doing, they might ensure  \\n that the decline of profits becomes permanent.  \\n Operations process measures  \\n reflect the activities directly related to sale of goods  \\n or services to customers,  \\n including receipt of customer orders,  \\n creation of products and delivery of products.  \\n Earlier, I use the example of an internal processes measure  \\n for an eyeglasses store.  \\n The daily number of eyeglasses returned to the technicians  \\n because the glasses are broken, don't fit the prescription,  \\n or are not what the customer ordered.  \\n In the area of operations management,  \\n this is sometimes called Six Sigma.  \\n Six Sigma is the idea that operations processes  \\n should be so designed and monitored  \\n as to reduce the number of errors or defects  \\n to just a handful three or four in a million.  \\n Service after sale process measures are of two types.  \\n One type of service after sale process  \\n involves the billing  \\n and collection of payments from customers.  \\n The other type involves the organization's commitment  \\n to back its product,  \\n including efforts to repair or replace products  \\n and provide post sale support and guidance  \\n in the use of the product.  \\n Now, billing and collection don't sound very exciting,  \\n but companies that aren't able  \\n to efficiently click cash from customers  \\n without alienating those customers,  \\n aren't going to survive long.  \\n So a good measure is really that old financial measure,  \\n average collection period,  \\n which is the number of days from the time of sale  \\n until cash collection.  \\n The success of continuing customer support  \\n can be measured by the time elapsed  \\n between the receipt of a customer request,  \\n and the satisfaction of that request.  \\n And this illustrates the interrelation  \\n of the balanced scorecard measures,  \\n depending on a customer's experience  \\n with service after the sale,  \\n that customer is more or less likely to be satisfied.  \\n And now recall that customer satisfaction  \\n is a leading measure in the customer section  \\n of the balanced scorecard.  \\n Higher customer satisfaction  \\n means better customer retention,  \\n a customer outcome measure  \\n and better customer retention  \\n means better financial results.  \\n None of this happens if the business operations  \\n are not functioning properly.  \\n The internal processes measures  \\n in the balance scorecard framework,  \\n help managers monitor how the business is actually working.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3020480\",\"duration\":171,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Employee growth and satisfaction\",\"fileName\":\"428726_en_US_02_06_2021Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learning and growth measures focus on the company\u2019s employees.

 \\n - Well, I think that the most difficult part,  \\n in getting settled in Hong Kong,  \\n was getting the 4 children enrolled in schools.  \\n - Your 2 daughters attended a British school  \\n located adjacent to the University campus  \\n where you were living.  \\n How about your 2 sons?  \\n - Ah, my 2 sons Darold and Hon.  \\n They attended an international school  \\n that was about a 45 minute trip away from our apartment.  \\n At the time they were ages 13 and 11.  \\n Now I went with them to school their first day  \\n for the school orientation.  \\n - How did you make the trip?  \\n I know you didn't have a car when you lived in Hong Kong.  \\n Did you take a taxi the whole way?  \\n - No, no.  \\n We rode a bus about half the way  \\n and then transferred to the subway.  \\n Now you may remember that the subway in Hong Kong  \\n is called the MTR.  \\n - But wasn't there a school bus or something?  \\n - Well, at the orientation,  \\n I learned that the two boys could ride a private school bus.  \\n The cost was 7 US dollars per day.  \\n - $7 a day, each?  \\n That seems kind of expensive.  \\n - Yeah, that's what I thought.  \\n Because we had traveled to the school  \\n by public transportation  \\n I knew that my sons, as students,  \\n could travel to and from school each day for about $1 each.  \\n - So you could save $6 a day for each boy,  \\n if they would be willing to ride public transportation  \\n to and from school.  \\n - Exactly.  \\n Now that was the analysis that I was doing  \\n in my head as I sat in the school orientation meeting.  \\n - Yes, but how could you get your 2 sons  \\n to agree to catch the bus  \\n and then transfer to the subway,  \\n and then finally walk the final leg  \\n from the subway station to the school?  \\n With the school bus they could relax the whole way.  \\n - Well, as I thought about it  \\n during the school principals orientation presentation,  \\n I guess I should have been paying attention to her,  \\n but anyway,  \\n I had an accounting measurement  \\n performance evaluation insight:  \\n I would offer to split the savings with my sons.  \\n - Now, I know your son's.  \\n The possibility of making some money  \\n each day would be of interest to them.  \\n - Absolutely.  \\n After the orientation meeting,  \\n the three of us went out into a little park  \\n behind their school.  \\n I explained my plan.  \\n If they would ride public transportation to and from school,  \\n I would pay them 3 US dollars every day.  \\n In effect, I would split the $6 family savings  \\n with them fifty-fifty.  \\n - And what did they say?  \\n - They agreed immediately.  \\n Thereafter at the end of each school week, on Friday,  \\n I paid them $15 each.  \\n 5 school days multiplied by their $3.  \\n Their half of the family savings.  \\n - So were there any difficulties  \\n associated with this system?

Remember you get what you measure.  \\n And sometimes you only get what you measure,  \\n which is not necessarily what you want.  \\n The Volkswagen engineers had designed their software  \\n to allow the Volkswagen engines to pass emissions tests.  \\n In the view of these engineers,  \\n the goal was not to deliver cleaner air,  \\n instead, the goal was to pass the test.  \\n Hey, you get what you measure.  \\n So be careful of what you measure,  \\n and monitor the measurement process carefully.  \\n Now in a postscript, do we now have to worry  \\n about the credibility of all emissions testing?  \\n I don't think so.  \\n This Volkswagen debacle has cost Volkswagen shareholders  \\n billions of dollars in market value  \\n and will cost the company billions more  \\n in recall and refit costs.  \\n And we have not yet even begun to see the lawsuits  \\n that will be filed against Volkswagen by angry owners  \\n whose cars have lost their resale value  \\n and by people claiming medical harm  \\n from these Volkswagen dirty diesel engines.  \\n I think this multi-billion dollar mistake  \\n by some engineers and executives at Volkswagen  \\n will serve as a nice object lesson  \\n for other automobile industry executives  \\n thinking of cutting corners on emission standards.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"4.

 \\n No, they don't want me.  \\n That sign is placed at the eye level of other drivers,  \\n drivers who are driving for other trucking companies.  \\n Trucking companies are in a constant struggle  \\n to renew their driver group because of this large turnover.  \\n Happy experienced drivers result in lower training costs,  \\n lower accident costs and increased customer satisfaction.  \\n If I were the CEO of XYZ Trucking,  \\n I would like to have one executive tell me every morning  \\n how we are doing with driver retention.  \\n Every morning at 8:00 am,  \\n we would look at the number of drivers who left us yesterday  \\n and my driver retention executive  \\n will then need to explain to me the trend,  \\n are we getting better?  \\n Are we getting worse?  \\n The key point is this,  \\n I would not need to tell this executive how to do her job.  \\n This one number, the daily driver turnover number  \\n would cause her to spend her time each day  \\n thinking about the drivers,  \\n worrying about their drivers,  \\n coming up with plans to keep them happy  \\n and attached to the company.  \\n This executive might even develop some leading measures,  \\n such as surveys of drivers satisfaction.  \\n This executive would be proactive  \\n in developing a positive relationship with the drivers.  \\n From the standpoint of the drivers,  \\n it appears that this executive really cares about them,  \\n and maybe she does,  \\n but another reason that she appears  \\n to care about the drivers is because of that KPI,  \\n number of drivers who quit,  \\n and her responsibility to explain that number  \\n every morning at 8:00 am.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3023041\",\"duration\":130,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Leading measures for company goals\",\"fileName\":\"428726_en_US_05_03_2021Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about the second key performance indicator (KPI) for a trucking company, explore the KPI billable miles per tractor per day, and set leading measures for how to reach goals by members of an executive team.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":6902462,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - So we're still at the daily 8:00 AM meeting  \\n of the CEO and top executives of XYZ Trucking.  \\n We are looking at four key performance indicators or KPIs.  \\n First measure, driver turnover.  \\n The second measure is billable miles per tractor per day.  \\n So this is the total number of revenue miles  \\n driven yesterday divided by the total number  \\n of tractors in our fleet.  \\n By the way, in the trucking business,  \\n the tractor is the front part, where the driver sits  \\n and the back part, where the load is is called the trailer.  \\n Now notice that we are counting only billable miles.  \\n Driving a truck empty to get back to an XYZ Trucking base  \\n doesn't earn us any money.  \\n And also, we are counting all tractors,  \\n including those that are currently down for repairs,  \\n all tractors,  \\n Our goal for this number is 650 billable miles  \\n per tractor per day.  \\n This is a pretty aggressive goal.  \\n Have you ever driven 650 miles in a day?

 \\n Well, there are three very different sets of people  \\n involved in this important number,  \\n the scheduler, the billing clerk,  \\n and the accounts receivable clerk.  \\n First there's a scheduler  \\n who's responsible for getting the loads delivered quickly.  \\n The computerized scheduling programs  \\n used by trucking companies are quite sophisticated  \\n and these programs make the trucking business  \\n increasingly competitive.  \\n Some customer companies are reducing their reliance  \\n on one trucking company,  \\n and are instead putting every shipment  \\n up forbid in the open market.  \\n These shipment jobs are posted and bid on  \\n almost like shares in the stock market,  \\n and in order to be successful in these competitive bids,  \\n a company has to know where its trucks are,  \\n and which of its drivers are ready to drive.  \\n Then there's the billing clerk,  \\n who's responsible for sending out the bills  \\n immediately after the loads are delivered.  \\n The billing crook job doesn't sound very exciting,  \\n but in this case it's crucial.  \\n If the billing curve sits on the bills for a few days,  \\n that's a few more days that XYZ trucking  \\n is not going to be able to have its cash.  \\n If XYZ doesn't quickly get its cash from its customers,  \\n then when XYZ has to pay its bills,  \\n such as driver compensation,  \\n it may have to borrow money to pay those bills,  \\n driving up company costs,  \\n and it's foolishly optimistic to expect our customers  \\n to pay us before we even send them a bill.  \\n And it probably isn't a good idea  \\n to send the bill before the work is done  \\n and the load is delivered.  \\n So this billing Kirk job is an important one here,  \\n and is reflected in this KPI days pickup to cash.  \\n Finally, there's the accounts receivable clerk  \\n who monitors the age of receivables  \\n and who gently prods any customers who are slow in paying.  \\n This accounts receivable clerk  \\n also works with the account managers  \\n for the large customers.  \\n The job of these account managers  \\n is to keep good relations with the customers  \\n so that they can kindly,  \\n but firmly deliver the pay up message  \\n when a customer is slow in paying.  \\n As you can see,  \\n it might make sense to have three sub-measures here,  \\n one for each of the people or departments involved.  \\n If I were the CEO, I would designate one of my executives  \\n to be responsible for all three of these processes.  \\n Again, I don't have to tell these people  \\n how to do their jobs,  \\n they just need to know  \\n that I will look at this KPI every morning,  \\n and we'll want an explanation for any slow down  \\n in the day's pickup to cash.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3022477\",\"duration\":182,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Cash incentives for motivational performance\",\"fileName\":\"428726_en_US_05_05_2021Q4_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn about the fourth key performance indicator (KPI) for a trucking company and developing a KPI to increase the fuel purchased from company docks.

Can an organization have too many\\nkey performance indicators, or KPIs?\\nWell, of course it can.\\nThe word key means that the organization has gone through\\na selection process to identify a few key measurements\\nout of the many possible ones that are the most important.\\nSo how many is too many?\\nWell, in 1956, the year I was born, George Miller,\\na professor of psychology at Princeton University\\npublished a paper titled The Magical Number Seven,\\nPlus or Minus Two:\\nSome Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information.\\n\\nWell, I like this title,\\nbecause it tells you just about everything you need to know\\nabout the results of Professor Miller's research.\\nThe title itself is an embodiment of the idea\\nof summarizing a complex set of data\\ninto a few key measures, seven, plus or minus two.\\nProfessor Miller's research indicated that the human brain\\ncan store seven items of information in working memory.\\nA couple more for numerical digits\\nand a couple less for complete words.\\nSo as we consider the question of whether an organization\\ncan have too many KPIs\\nlet's keep this number seven in mind.\\n\\nNow let's talk about the Pareto Principle.\\nThis principle is named after the Italian economist\\nVilfredo Pareto, who found that 80% of the land in Italy\\nwas owned by just 20% of the people.\\nNow this 80, 20 rule has been found to work\\nin many different situations.\\nFor example, about 80% of the profit in a regular company\\ncomes from just 20% of the products.\\n80% of the student related problems at a university\\nare caused by just 20% of the students.\\n80% of the users of a piece of software\\nuse just 20% of the software features.\\n\\nThat's the Pareto Principle, 80, 20.\\nNow with respect to KPIs\\nthis suggests focusing on a few key measures.\\nThe measures that reflect the essence\\nof the most important organizational drivers.\\nThe 20% of factors that drive the 80% of the results.\\nSo how many KPIs should an organization have?\\nThe consensus seems to be that the number of KPIs\\nshould be somewhere between 10 and 20.\\nYes, this is more than Professor Miller's seven,\\nplus or minus two,\\nbut here we're taking advantage of the fact\\nthat we can write these numbers down\\nor put them on a computer screen,\\nso that they don't have to be stored\\nin the short term memory of our brain.\\n\\nWith too few KPIs you're missing measurements\\nthat can tell you something important\\nabout your complex organization.\\nYou're like the pilots in our example\\nwho want to try to fly the plane\\nby looking at just one instrument reading.\\nBut with too many KPIs\\nyou are overwhelming the human brain.\\nAnd an overwhelmed brain tends to just start\\nblocking things out randomly.\\nIt is better to strategically go through\\na set of potential KPIs\\nand identify the most important ones,\\nrather than have a manager's overwhelmed brain\\nrandomly focus on a few items.\\n\\nSo what's the best number of KPIs?\\nSomewhere between 10 and 20.\\nThe Balanced Scorecard is a way to organize\\nthese 10 or 20 KPIs into coherent

principle, simply stated.\\nYou get what you measure, that's it.\\nIf you start measuring something\\nthen people will naturally focus on that thing.\\nHere's a nice illustration.\\nIn the old Soviet Union, oil drilling teams\\nwere placed in competition one with another\\nto motivate hard work.\\nThe competition rules were set up so that the teams\\nreceived recognition and compensation\\nbased on the number of meters drilled.\\n\\nInterestingly, the award-winning team recognized\\nin the newspaper Pravda, drilled meter after meter,\\nbut never struck oil.\\nIt seems that the clever members of this team\\nrealized that the first 100 meters of drilling\\ndo not require as much effort and expense\\nas the second, third and fourth hundred meters.\\nThe deeper the oil well, the longer it takes\\nto drill one incremental meter.\\nSo, the winning team drilled an impressive\\nnumber of dry holes, none of which were deeper\\nthan 100 meters.\\n\\nThey just moved around their area,\\ndrilling the easy 100 meters,\\nthen extracting their drilling equipment,\\nmoving a short distance away,\\ndrilling another easy 100 meters and so on.\\nThe drilling teams were being evaluated\\non number of meters drilled,\\nso they focused on meters.\\nThey didn't care about oil or about drilling\\nas deeply as the geologist's had said they should.\\nNow, let's consider what would have been\\na better basis for evaluating the performance\\nof the drilling teams.\\nI've used this exercise in classes\\nwith business executives many times\\nand here's some of their suggestions.\\n\\nFirst, reward only successful wells.\\nNow, this is a natural suggestion.\\nHowever, this could also lead to problems\\nbecause the finding of oil has a random element\\nand also depends on the skill of the geologist\\nwho have told the drilling teams where to drill.\\nA performance evaluation system that is random\\nor that relies on the skills of others\\ncan lead to frustration by those being evaluated.\\nAnother suggestion, give extra credit for deeper wells,\\nanother possibility.\\nDrilled meters in the second hundred meters\\nshould count more than meters drilled\\nin the first hundred meters\\nand even more for meters drilled\\nin the third hundred meters and so on.\\n\\nThe deeper the well, the more the chance of finding oil\\nand thus the more credit given more each incremental meter.\\nWell, here you also have to be careful.\\nIf you give too much credit for very deep wells,\\nyou will create an incentive for the drilling teams\\nto just drill deep holes, without caring whether\\nthey have gotten past the zone where oil\\nis expected to be found.\\nNow, by the way, I could stop here\\nand tell you about the time that my brother\\nJim and I went two miles down in a goldmine\\nin South Africa, that's a story for another day.\\nSo, here's another possibility.\\n\\nHere's a content rule suggestion\\nthat I heard just last week\\nwhen I was teaching some business executives in Moscow.\\nA person in the course, whose experience in the oil\\nexploration business, said that the proper way\\nto motivate the workers was to give them credit\\nfor meters drilled only after they had reached\\nthe depth indicated by the geologist's as\\nbeing the most likely location of oil for that spot.\\nUntil reaching that minimum depth,\\nthe drilling team should get no credit.\\nNow, this isn't a course on how to motivate oil drillers,\\nbut the general point is that the implications\\nof the Performance Measurement System\\nhave to be very carefully considered.\\n\\nIf you measure and reward meters drilled,\\nyou'll get meters.\\nIn this case, that meant lots of useless\\n100 meter deep holes.\\nIf you want your people to focus on something else,\\nthen you need to measure something else.\\nPerformance measurement and performance evaluation\\nare extremely powerful tools to motivate employee behavior.\\nRemember, you get what you measure,\\nso be careful what you measure.\\nWe will keep this in mind as we discuss\\nKey Performance Indicators and the Balance Scorecard.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

How many dollars of profit\\ndoes a company make from each 100 dollars in sales?\\nFor example, for Walmart, this number is four.\\n\\nFor Microsoft, it's 25.\\nThese companies track these numbers from year to year\\nand also benchmark with their competitors.\\nAnother financial measure, average collection period.\\nHow many days does it take a company\\nto collect its cash from its credit customers?\\nIf that number's too big, meaning that\\nthe collection period is too long,\\nthen cash that could be used to pay bills\\nis still in the pockets of the customers.\\nThis increases the need for short term borrowing\\nand raises the cost of doing business.\\nAnother financial measure, sales per square foot.\\n\\nHow efficiently is a retailer using\\nits floor space to generate sales?\\nAnother measure, current ratio, defined as\\ncurrent assets, such as cash and inventory, divided\\nby current liabilities, which are short-term obligations,\\nsuch as amounts owed to suppliers.\\nThis is a traditional liquidity measure,\\nreflecting a company's ability\\nto meet its obligations in the short term.\\nAnother financial measure, debt ratio,\\ndefined as total liabilities divided by total assets,\\nand interpreted as the fraction of total financing\\nthat has been obtained through borrowing.\\n\\nNow, for most large companies,\\nthis debt ratio number is between 50 and 60 percent.\\nMuch higher than this and the company is at risk\\nof not being able to repay all of its lenders.\\nAnother financial measure, return on equity,\\noften called ROE, defined as net income\\ndivided by owner investment.\\nThis is a number of dollars of profit generated\\nfor each 100 dollars of owner investment.\\nFor a great company, this number is 20 percent or more.\\nFor a poor company, it's less than 10 percent.\\nNow a little side comment here, my brother Jim and I\\nhave an entire course devoted to financial ratios.\\n\\nThe course is titled Running a Profitable Business:\\nUnderstanding Financial Ratios.\\nHey, take a look.\\nNow, viewed more broadly, however,\\nsome companies may wish to do more\\nthan just maximize owner profits.\\nFor example, the traditional German concept\\nof vorsicht, or prudence, is based on the idea\\nthat the company should be operated\\nfor the benefit of all stakeholders,\\nowners, employees, banks, local communities and so forth.\\nThe balanced scorecard is flexible enough to include\\nmeasures that draw attention to all of these stakeholders.\\n\\nNow one of my colleagues, Kirill Novoselov,\\nis doing research based on the idea of maximizing\\nthe ability of a company to survive in the long term.\\nHis insight is that in the long term,\\nonly the companies that are able to survive\\nthrough the bad times are going\\nto be around to generate profits,\\nso he and his colleagues are looking at financial measures\\nsuch as the amounts that a company\\nspends on capital improvements and the amount\\nit spends on research and development.\\nThey are finding that these companies\\nthat seem to be sacrificing short term profits\\nand cash flows appear to be more robust\\nand profitable in the long term.\\n\\nNow the key point is this.\\nAs part of a strategic planning process,\\na company needs to determine exactly\\nwhat its financial goals are, maximize short term profits,\\nincrease

The first key to strong financial performance\\nis identifying customer needs and satisfying them.\\nWhen companies understand what their customers\\nwant and will pay for, then these companies\\ncan design customer focused performance measures\\nthat lead to growth in market share,\\nincreased revenues and long term profits.\\nNow with customers, let's think of leading measures\\nand outcome measures.\\nLeading measures reflect whether the company is\\ncurrently meeting or exceeding its customers expectations.\\nOutcome measures reflect whether customers are\\nstaying with the company and whether those customers\\nare recommending the company to others.\\n\\nSo let's talk about some leading measures.\\nFirst, the ratio of my selling prices,\\nto those of my competitors.\\nIf my prices are higher than are my competitors prices\\nthen my customers are going to be less likely\\nto stay with me, unless I'm providing them\\nwith some extra value.\\nBetter service, more timely delivery and so forth.\\nAnother measure, number of returned items.\\nAn increase in the number of customers who are returning\\nitems is likely to lead in a decrease\\nin returning customers.\\n\\nAnother measure, percent of on-time deliveries.\\nIf you are delivering a product or service,\\nand you promise delivery at a certain time,\\nyour customers are going to respond negatively\\nto late delivery.\\nAnother measure, a decrease in the percentage of on-time\\ndeliveries is not a good omen\\nfor future customer satisfaction.\\nCustomer satisfaction surveys, another measure.\\nDissatisfied customers are more likely to leave you\\nand go to one of your competitors.\\nThese leading measures give us advanced warning\\nof possible future problems in terms of\\nretaining customers and attracting new customers.\\n\\nNow let's talk about some outcome measures.\\nMarket share is the proportion of industry sales\\nof a particular product or service that is controlled\\nby a specific firm.\\nFor example, market share in the soft drink business,\\nis a critical and off sided number.\\nIn 2014, Coca-Cola had the highest market share,\\nwith 18 percent of the U.S. soft drink market.\\nPepsi was at number two with nine percent,\\njust edging out number three, Diet Coke.\\nNow do you think that soft drink executives follow\\nthese market share numbers, of course they do.\\n\\nCompanies increase their market share in two ways,\\nretaining current customers and acquiring new customers.\\nSo clearly companies that can not service their\\ncurrent customers better than competitors will be\\nhard pressed to maintain market share.\\nAnother outcome measure is the\\nnumber of returning customers.\\nThis number might be something like,\\nthe fraction of customers last quarter,\\nor last year, who have returned this quarter, or this year.\\nThe best customers are returning customers,\\nbecause you don't have to spend money to find them\\nand to get them to try your product or service.\\n\\nNow of course there's a connection between having\\nan enthusiastic base of existing satisfied customers\\nand the ability to attract new customers.\\nAnother outcome measure is the number of new customers.\\nThis number might be measured in terms of actual\\nnumber of new customers, or dollars\\nof new customer business.\\nAlso it's important to track the cost of attracting\\nnew customers, if for no other reason, then to remind\\nyou how costly it is to replace any customers\\nyou lose because of not meeting the expectations\\nof current customers.\\n\\nThe customer measures in the balance score card,\\nremind managers that strong financial performance\\nstarts with satisfied customers.\\nThe existence of both, leading an outcome measures\\nreminds managers that it's better to measure,\\ndetect and fix problems with customer relations\\nrather than to measure a drop in the number of customers,\\nand then sit around trying to figure out\\nhow to get them back.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:515267\",\"duration\":237,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Internal processes

The internal processes measures\\nin the balanced scorecard framework\\nhelp managers monitor how the business is actually working.\\nLet's organize these internal processes measures\\ninto three groups, innovation measures,\\noperations measures, and service-after-sale measures.\\nInnovation process measures reflect the process\\nof identifying and creating new products.\\nFor many companies, innovation is where\\nmuch of a company's competitive edge is created.\\nIt is important to the ultimate financial success\\nof the organization that the critical effort\\nto identify and develop new products and services\\nis effectively managed.\\n\\nFor example, for companies operating in rapidly\\nevolving markets, a discipline of spending money\\non research and development is crucial.\\nSo, one innovation process measure might be\\nthe percentage of revenue spent on R and D.\\nFor many companies, this percentage is remarkably\\nstable from year to year, reflecting a company\\ndecision to keep plowing money back into R and D.\\nFor example, I happen to have this measure\\nfor several companies for 2012.\\nDuring 2012, Intel spent 19% of its revenue on R and D\\nand Intel consistently spends that high amount.\\n\\nFor Microsoft, the number was 13%.\\nAgain, Microsoft consistently spends that high amount\\non research and development.\\nThis measurement reflects a key change in perspective.\\nSpending money on R and D is not a negative,\\nit's a positive.\\nThese balanced scorecard measures remind\\nmanagers that money must be consistently spent\\non key items in order to keep the company alive and growing.\\nWithout this perspective, the accountants\\nand the budget cutters would slash R and D spending\\nat the first sign of a temporary decline in profits\\nand by so doing, they might ensure\\nthat the decline in profits becomes permanent.\\n\\nOperations process measures reflect the activities\\ndirectly related to sale of goods or services to customers,\\nincluding receipt of customer orders,\\ncreation of products, and delivery of products.\\nEarlier, I used the example of an internal processes measure\\nfor an eyeglasses store, the daily number\\nof eyeglasses returned to the technicians\\nbecause the glasses are broken,\\ndon't fit the prescription, or\\nare not what the customer ordered.\\nIn the area of operations management,\\nthis is sometimes called Six Sigma.\\nSix Sigma is the idea that operations processes\\nshould be so designed and monitored as to reduce\\nthe number of errors or defects to just a handful,\\nthree or four in a million.\\n\\nService-after-sale process measures are of two types.\\nOne type of service-after-sale process\\ninvolves the billing and collection\\nof payments from customers.\\nThe other type involves the organization's\\ncommitment to back its product,\\nincluding efforts to repair or replace\\nproducts and provide post-sale support and guidance\\nin the use of the product.\\nNow, billing and collection don't sound very exciting,\\nbut companies that aren't able to efficiently\\nable to collect cash from customers,\\nwithout alienating those customers\\naren't going to survive long.\\n\\nSo a good measure is really that old financial measure,\\naverage collection period, which is the number\\nof days from the time of sale until cash collection.\\nThe success of continuing customer support\\ncan be measured by the time elapsed\\nbetween the receipt of a customer request\\nand a satisfaction of that request\\nand this illustrates the interrelation\\nof the balanced scorecard measures.\\nDepending on a customer's experience with service\\nafter the sale, that customer is more or less likely\\nto be satisfied and now recall that customer\\nsatisfaction is a leading measure\\nin the customer section of the balanced scorecard.\\n\\nHigher customer satisfaction means\\nbetter customer retention, a customer outcome measure,\\nand better customer retention means\\nbetter financial results.\\nNone of this happens if the business operations\\nare not functioning properly.\\nThe internal processes measures in the balanced\\nscorecard framework help managers monitor\\nhow the business is actually working.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:515268\",\"duration\":191,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Employee growth and

In my opinion the learning and growth measures\\nare a very valuable contribution\\nof the balanced scorecard approach.\\nThe Learning and Growth Measures\\nfocus on the company's employees.\\nTraditional financial measures can cause managers\\nto view employees as a cost.\\nThe balanced scorecard focuses a manager on viewing\\nthe employees as a key resource.\\nNow an infamous example of this\\nis the statement by Jerry Krause,\\ngeneral manager of the Chicago Bulls during the 1980s\\nand the 1990s.\\nHe said that players don't win championships,\\norganizations win championships.\\n\\nWell, it turns out that organizations\\nwith the right players, such as Michael Jordan,\\nthey win championships.\\nThe large CPA firms these days\\nare constantly talking about work life balance.\\nNow is it because these firms are charitable organizations\\nthat care only about their employee's happiness?\\nNo.\\nInstead the CPA firms realize that their good employees\\nare a resource, not a cost,\\nand that they can increase their financial profits\\nby retaining their good employees.\\nAs with the customer measures,\\nit is useful to think of the employee measures\\nas being both leading measures and outcome measures.\\n\\nAn important Leading Measure is the amount spent\\non employee training.\\nAs with spending on research and development,\\nthis measurement of spending on employee training\\nreflects a key change in perspective.\\nSpending money on training is not a negative,\\nit's a positive.\\nMeasuring spending on employee training,\\nor tracking the number of employees\\nwho have completed additional certification courses,\\nsuch as this one,\\nreminds managers that money must be consistently spent\\non employee development in order to keep the employee\\nsatisfied and engaged.\\n\\nAgain, without this perspective the accountants\\nand the budget cutters would slash compensation\\nand increase layoffs at the first sign\\nof a temporary decline in profits.\\nSuch short term actions motivated by a focus\\non just measures of short term profits\\nreduce employee loyalty\\nand increase the cost of doing business in the long run.\\nThe ultimate result of building learning and growth\\nin the organization is to enhance employee productivity.\\nEmployee productivity then leads\\nto internal process improvements.\\n\\nRelated to employee productivity is the employee retention\\nand employee satisfaction.\\nThese three issues form the desired outcome measures\\nof learning and growth.\\nTherefore the organization should track performance\\nin the productivity, retention rates, and satisfaction\\nof its employees.\\nA good accounting system can and should measure\\nsatisfaction of employees using surveys,\\nreporting on resignation trends within the company,\\nand measure employees productivity in terms of volume,\\nquality, and timeliness of output.\\n\\nTo review, the Balanced Scorecard is a framework\\nfor organizing a company's performance measures,\\nor key performance indicators, the KPIs.\\nA traditional way to structure the Balanced Scorecard\\nis to organize the KPIs into four areas,\\nfinancial, customers, internal processes,\\nand learning and growth, which is with the employees.\\nThe Balanced Scorecard framework is an aid\\nto help managers identify areas in which they should create\\nkey

statement\\nis important in establishing both\\nthose things that the company will do\\nand those things that the company won't do.\\nFor example, history is riddled with companies\\nand other organizations that have experienced\\ndifficulties as their efforts have become unfocused.\\nThey are like a little child splashing around\\nin a pond trying to catch all of the fish\\nand ending up catching none of the fish.\\n\\nNow here's the mission statement of McDonald's.\\nOur brand mission is to be our customers'\\nfavorite place and way to eat.\\nNow in my opinion this is a great\\nmission statement.\\nThis McDonald's mission statement suggests\\nthat McDonald's has decided, at least for now,\\nnot to extend it's powerful brand name\\ninto a broad array of goods and services.\\nNow McDonald's has a world-wide reputation\\nfor consistency and value.\\nSo, would people buy McDonald's gasoline?\\nProbably.\\nWould people stay in a McDonald's hotel?\\nI think so.\\n\\nWould people deposit their money in a McDonald's bank?\\nPossibly.\\nBy the mission statement says that for now\\nMcDonald's is focused on a certain\\nplace and way to eat.\\nThe mission statement provides direction.\\nAn example of a very precise mission statement\\nis the acquisition criteria of Berkshire Hathaway.\\nThese criteria are reprinted each year\\nin Warren Buffet's letter to the\\nBerkshire Hathaway shareholders.\\nAs an example of the specific nature\\nof this statement, one of the criteria\\nis that all potential acquisitions be large,\\nwith the target company already generating\\nannual before-tax earnings of at least $75 million.\\n\\nA couple of more items on the list\\nare as follows.\\nWe will not engage in unfriendly takeovers.\\nWe are interested in simple businesses\\n(if there's lots of technology, we won't understand it).\\nThese acquisition criteria make clear\\nwhat Berkshire Hathaway will and will not\\nconsider in terms of buying companies.\\nA mission statement can also involve\\na much broader vision.\\nFor example, the mission statement of Ben & Jerry's\\nwhich is now owned by Unilever, a Dutch based\\nconsumer products company that's also the largest\\nseller of ice cream in the world,\\nincludes three dimensions.\\n\\nProduct mission; to make, distribute and sell\\nthe finest quality all natural ice cream\\nand promote business practices that respect\\nthe Earth and the environment.\\nEconomic mission; to operate the Company\\non a sustainable financial basis of profitable growth,\\nincreasing value for our

business plays in society.\\n\\nNow, some hard bitten died in the wool capitalist\\nmight disagree with Ben & Jerry's emphasis\\non the environment, on nurturing labor practices,\\nand on social awareness.\\nFine.\\nThe beauty of a good mission statement\\nis that it tells potential investors\\nwhat fundamental principles will be used\\nby management in making corporate decisions.\\nIf an investor disagrees with these\\nfundamental principles then she or he\\ncan easily decide to invest in a different company.\\nIn summary, a good mission statement\\nis specific and clear enough to

because it tells us\\nwhat the optometrist is and is not going to do.\\nNotice the emphasis on quality service\\nand lifetime relationships.\\n\\nThis mission statement makes clear\\nthat the optometrist is not going to try\\nto compete with the low cost providers,\\nthe supermarkets and the online sellers.\\nInstead, the optometrist is going to focus on service\\nand developing long term relationships with customers.\\nAnd what does a mission statement have to do\\nwith accounting, balanced scorecards and KPIs?\\nA mission statement defines what actions\\nan organization views as being important.\\nIt is then the job of the accounting system\\nto measure and reward those actions.\\nAnd here's one of the new key performance indicators,\\nor KPIs that the optometrist is now going to track.\\n\\nPercentage of customers who must wait more than 15 minutes\\nafter appointment time before seeing the optometrist.\\nNow, to make things more specific,\\nlet's assume that the office receptionist\\nhas been made responsible for this KPI.\\nLet's consider how his behavior might change\\nonce this measure begins to be discussed\\nat weekly staff meetings.\\nWe will see how employees' behavior changes\\njust because of a certain activity now being measured.\\nLet's not worry about how we will\\nmeasure these waiting times.\\nLet's assume that we have a perfect measurement device\\nthat the receptionist can't manipulate.\\n\\nPerhaps it's as simple as patients being required\\nto log in and out on a written log.\\nSo with this measurement and evaluation system in place,\\ninstead of passively sitting behind his desk,\\nthe receptionist is going to constantly monitor\\nthe people in the waiting room.\\nHow long has each person been there?\\nWhat time is their appointment?\\nThe receptionist now has a personal interest\\nin each patient, and in his or her time.\\nThe receptionist would be very careful about scheduling,\\nchecking the details of each appointment to make allowances\\nfor consultations that might take extra time.\\n\\nIf the receptionist can see that the optometrist\\nand her staff are running late, the receptionist may decide\\nto call scheduled patients and offer to reschedule.\\nCan you imagine how you would feel\\nif you got a call from your optometrist\\nor doctor or dentist that went as follows?\\nHey, the doctor's running late.\\nYour time's important to us.\\nRather than come to the office\\nand just sit in the waiting room for an extra 30 minutes,\\nwould you like to reschedule your appointment time?\\nNow, I myself would be very impressed\\nat the quality of service if I were to get such a call.\\n\\nNow, this is not a perfect measure.\\nThe receptionist may now have an incentive\\nto spread the appointments too much, cutting down\\non the number of patients and so hurting revenue.\\nThe optometrist will need to keep an eye on this.\\nBut the key point is this.\\nThe receptionist will now do his job differently,\\nnot because he's loyal to the optometrist,\\nnot because he's loyal to the patients,\\nnot because he has attended\\na series of seminars on customer service.\\nNo, the receptionist will proactively think of ways\\nto serve the patients better because of the simple fact\\nthat a new accounting measure, a KPI, is now being tracked\\nand then discussed in the

British school\\nlocated adjacent to the university campus\\nwhere you were living.\\nHow about your two sons?\\n- Ah, my two sons, Derrald and Han.\\nThey attended an international school\\nthat was about a 45 minute trip away from our apartment.\\n\\nAt the time, they were ages 13 and 11.\\nNow, I went with them to school their first day\\nfor their school orientation.\\n- How did you make the

remember that the subway in Hong Kong\\nis called the MTR.\\n- Well, wasn't there a school bus or something?\\n- Well, at the orientation,\\nI learned that the two boys could ride a private school

transportation,\\nI knew that my sons, as students,\\ncould travel to and from school each day\\nfor about one dollar each.\\n- So, you could save six dollars a day for each boy\\nif they would be willing to ride public transportation\\nto and from school.\\n- Exactly.\\nNow, that was the analysis that I was doing in my head\\nas I sat in the school orientation meeting.\\n- Yes, but how could you get your two sons to agree\\nto catch the bus\\nand then transfer to the subway\\nand then finally walk the final leg\\nfrom the subway station to their school?\\nWith the school bus, they could

schools.\\nI myself am proud to state that I have long been\\na visiting faculty member\\nat the Kellogg\u2013HKUST Executive MBA program,\\nwhich has been ranked number one in the world six times.\\n\\nThese rankings are prominently featured\\nin recruiting brochures, communications with alumni,\\nand in press releases.\\nThat is, they are prominently displayed if they're good,\\nbut when a top business school or a top law school\\nfalls out of the top 30\\nyou suddenly find the school talking a lot more\\nabout the quality of life,\\nthe camaraderie among the students,\\nand the beauty of the local community.\\nIn short, the school now talks about\\nanything but the rankings.\\nThese rankings are influential.\\nSo how are these rankings compiled?\\nBelow are the criteria, along with the associated weightings\\nthat U.S. News & World Report uses\\nin its widely cited ranking of US MBA programs.\\n\\nSo weighting at 25% academic reputation,\\n16.25% weighting on the average GMAT score\\nof enrolled students,\\n15% weighting on the reputation among recruiters,\\n14% weighting on the starting salaries of graduates,\\nalso 14% weighting on the percent employed\\nthree months after graduation,\\n7.5% weighting on the average undergraduate GPA\\nof enrolled students,\\n7% weighting on the percent employed at graduation,\\nand finally, 1.25% weighting on the proportion of applicants\\nthat are accepted.\\n\\nNow given these criteria\\nand assuming that an MBA program wishes\\nto maximize its ranking,\\nwould an MBA program have an incentive to increase\\nor to decrease the size of its MBA program?\\nRemember, you get what you measure.\\nIf you measure rankings what are you gonna get\\nin terms of class size?\\nWell the first item, academic reputation\\nis not a function of a class at all,\\nbut instead is driven by the historic reputation\\nof the university and the faculty,\\nso let's set that one to the side.\\nFor all of the rest of the criteria,\\nall of them, an MBA program will go up in the rankings\\nif it restricts the size of its program\\nto only a select group of top candidates.\\n\\nIn fact, to make this easy to

now sky high,\\nthat single excellent student is sure to get a good job\\nwith a high salary,\\nand because all of the other applicants were rejected\\nthe selectivity measure,\\nthe proportion of applicants accepted,\\nlooks really good.\\nSo if the board of trustees of a university\\ntells the MBA director, or the law school director\\nto increase the ranking of the program\\nwhat the board of trustees is really saying\\nis keep the program small.\\n\\nAnd this is exactly what we see\\nas the demand for MBA and law degrees ebbs and flows,\\ntop programs admit fewer students in down years\\nin order to maintain high admittance statistics\\nto maintain their rankings.\\nIs this what boards of trustees really want?\\nWell, that's for them to decide.\\nThe key measurement point is

more common in Europe\\nthan they are in the United States.\\nIn 2008, the emissions rules for diesel cars\\noperated in the United States were substantially tightened.\\nNo corresponding tightening happened in Europe until 2015.\\nSo, someone at Volkswagen, we don't know who yet,\\ndecided that rather than change the Volkswagen engines\\nto meet the tougher emission standards,\\nthey would instead change\\nthe Volkswagen software programming\\nto enable the diesel engines to pass the tougher tests.\\nNow, part of the reason for this decision\\nnot to adjust the engines to meet the actual standards\\nis reflected in this reported quote\\nfrom a Volkswagen executive.\\n\\n\\\"If US car buyers were smarter and better informed,\\n\\\"they'd buy our clean diesels\\n\\\"instead of all this hybrid nonsense.\\\"\\nSo, there was some apparent disdain\\nfor the whole emissions testing process\\nin the United States,\\nat least with respect to Volkswagen diesel engines.\\nThe Volkswagen software was designed\\nto detect when a car was being tested for emissions.\\nThis was done presumably by sensing when some,\\nbut not all of the wheels are moving.\\nAs is the case in a laboratory test\\nwhen only the drive rain wheels move\\non a treadmill-like device.\\n\\nClever programming.\\nAnyway, when the Volkswagen onboard computer\\ndetected an emissions test in progress,\\nit converted the engine operations to test mode.\\nIn test mode, the Volkswagen diesel engines\\nmet the nitrous oxide standards.\\nHowever, in actual on the road driving,\\nwhen the emissions evasion software was not activated,\\nthe nitrous oxide levels were from five to 35 times higher.\\nYikes.\\nRemember, you get what you measure\\nand sometimes you only get what you measure,\\nwhich is not necessarily what you want.\\n\\nThe Volkswagen engineers had designed their software\\nto allow the Volkswagen engines to pass emissions tests.\\nIn the view of these engineers,\\nthe goal was not to deliver cleaner air.\\nInstead, the goal was to pass the test.\\nHey, you get what you measure.\\nSo, be careful of what you measure\\nand monitor the measurement process carefully.\\nNow, in a postscript,\\ndo we now have to worry about the credibility\\nof all emissions testing?\\nI don't think so.\\nThis Volkswagen debacle has cost Volkswagen shareholders\\nbillions of dollars in market value\\nand will cost the company billions more\\nin recall and refit costs.\\n\\nAnd we have not yet even begun\\nto see the lawsuits that will be filed against Volkswagen\\nby angry owners whose cars have lost their resale value\\nand by people claiming medical harm\\nfrom these Volkswagen dirty diesel engines.\\nI think this multibllion dollar

trips among several customers,\\nvery simple.\\nThe shipping fee is negotiated for each job\\nand is stated in terms of the fee per mile.\\n- Now as with most service focused businesses,\\nthe success of XYZ trucking is based on the strength\\nof its relationship with its customers,\\nespecially its large customers.\\n\\n- XYZ's largest 20 customers account\\nfor about half of total sales.\\nSo the company assigns an individual account manager\\nfor each of these large customers.\\nThe job of these account managers,\\nto take care of any concerns that the customers have.\\n- Now of course, XYZ is always\\nseeking to expand its business.\\nCompany salespeople are constantly seeking\\nto create and expand relationships with customers\\nwho have decided to stop operating\\ntheir own in-house trucks and have instead decided\\nto start outsource their shipping\\nto trucking companies, such as XYZ.\\n\\n- [Voiceover] XYZ's biggest operating cost\\nby far is the compensation cost for the drivers.\\nTotal compensation costs about 50 percent of revenue.\\n- [Voiceover] XYZ is constantly seeking,\\nhiring, and training new drivers\\nbecause of the large driver turnover\\nthat it typical in the trucking industry.\\n- For new drivers, XYZ operates its own three week\\ntraining school, followed by an additional two months\\nof on the job training.\\n- [Voiceover] Drivers are paid on a per mile basis\\nwith the rate per mile increasing\\nthe longer the driver stays with XYZ.\\n\\n- XYZ also pays bonuses to drivers who reach\\ncertain length of service thresholds.\\nThis gives the drivers an added incentive to stay\\nwith XYZ rather than switch to a competing trucking company.\\n- [Voiceover] Now XYZ's second largest operating cost\\nis the cost of fuel.\\nThe fuel cost is the most volatile of XYZ's operating cost,\\nfluctuating up and down with the worldwide price of oil.\\n- XYZ attempts to reduce its fuel cost\\nby operating its own fuel depots.\\nXYZ can save 10 percent

companies.\\nI have heard of one trucking company\\nfor which the goal of annual turnover\\nis 72% for the drivers.\\nI am told that this company is always above\\n100% turnover for the year\\nand this is normal for a trucking company.\\nI spoke to another trucking company executive,\\nfor some reason I know lots of people\\ninvolved with trucking,\\nwho confirmed that his company is always\\nover 100% driver turnover per year.\\n\\nNow, I have mentioned this 100% turnover\\nto people in other businesses, they can't conceive\\nof how they would deal with high level of turnover\\nin their businesses.\\nIf you're in the United States,\\nthe next time you're on the freeway,\\nlook at the back of the big trucks on the road.\\nThere is almost always a sign on the back of the trailers\\nthat advertises for drivers.\\nThe sign speaks of good compensation\\nand then gives a phone number to call.\\nNow, is this sign speaking to me,\\nthe driver of a small car on the road?\\nNo, they don't want me.\\n\\nThat sign is placed at the eye level of other drivers.\\nDrivers who are driving for other trucking companies.\\nTrucking companies are in a constant struggle\\nto renew their driver group because of this large turnover.\\nHappy, experienced drivers result in lower training costs,\\nlower accident costs, and increased customer satisfaction.\\nIf I were the CEO of XYZ Trucking,\\nI would like to have one executive tell me\\nevery morning how we are doing with driver retention.\\nEvery morning at 8am, we would look at the number\\nof drivers who left us yesterday\\nand my driver retention executive\\nwould then need to explain to me the trend.\\n\\nAre we getting better?\\nAre we getting worse, why?\\nThe key point is this.\\nI would not need to tell this executive\\nhow to do her job.\\nThis one number, the daily driver turnover number,\\nwould cause her to spend her time each day\\nthinking about the drivers, worrying about the drivers,\\ncoming up with plans to keep them happy\\nand attach the company.\\nThis executive might even develop some leading measures,\\nsuch as surveys of driver satisfaction.\\nThis executive would be proactive\\nin developing a positive relationship with the drivers.\\n\\nFrom the standpoint of the drivers,\\nit appears that this executive really cares about them\\nand maybe she does, but another reason\\nthat she appears to care about the drivers\\nis because of that KPI, number of drivers who quit\\nand her responsibility to explain that number\\nevery morning at 8 AM.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:515283\",\"duration\":130,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Track billable miles each

finally, Time from billing to cash collection.\\nOur goal is to have every trip billed and collected\\nwithin 30 days from pickup.\\n\\nNow, whose performance should be evaluated\\nbased on this measure?\\nWell, there are three very different sets of people\\ninvolved in this important number.\\nThe Scheduler, the Billing clerk,\\nand the Accounts receivable clerk.\\nFirst, there's the Scheduler, who's responsible\\nfor getting the loads delivered quickly.\\nThe computerized scheduling programs\\nused by trucking companies are quite sophisticated,\\nand these programs\\nmake the trucking business increasingly competitive.\\nSome customer companies are reducing their reliance\\non one trucking company\\nand are instead putting every shipment up for bid\\nin the open market.\\n\\nThese shipment jobs are posted and bid on,\\nalmost like shares in the stock market.\\nAnd in order to be successful in these competitive bids,\\na company has to know where its trucks are,\\nand which of its drivers are ready to drive.\\nThen there's the Billing clerk,\\nwho's responsible for sending out the bills\\nimmediately after the loads are delivered.\\nThe Billing clerk job doesn't sound very exciting,\\nbut in this case, it's crucial.\\nIf the Billing clerk sits on the bills for a few days,\\nthat's a few more days that XYZ Trucking\\nis not gonna be able to have its cash.\\nIf XYZ doesn't quickly get its cash from its customers,\\nthen when XYZ has to pay its bills,\\nsuch as driver compensation,\\nit may have to borrow money to pay those bills,\\ndriving up company costs.\\n\\nAnd it's foolishly optimistic to expect our customers\\nto pay us before we even send them a bill.\\nAnd it probably isn't a good idea\\nto send the bill before the work is done\\nand the load is delivered.\\nSo this Billing clerk job is an important one here.\\nAnd is reflected in this KPI day's Pickup to cash.\\nFinally, there's the Accounts receivable clerk\\nwho monitors the age of receivables,\\nand who gently prods any customers who are slow in paying.\\nThis Accounts receivable clerk also works\\nwith the account managers for the large customers.\\n\\nThe job of these account managers is to keep good relations\\nwith the customers so that they can kindly,\\nbut firmly deliver the pay up message\\nwhen a customer is slow in paying.\\nAs you can see, it might make sense\\nto have three sub-measures here.\\nOne for each of the people or departments involved.\\nIf I were the CEO, I would designate one of my executives\\nto be responsible for all three of these processes.\\nAgain, I don't have to tell these people\\nhow to do their jobs.\\nThey just need to know that I will look at this KPI\\nevery morning and will want an explanation\\nfor any

fuel cost is the most volatile of XYZ's operating cost,\\nfluctuating up and down with the worldwide price of oil.\\n\\nXYZ attempts to reduce its fuel cost\\nby operating its own fuel depots.\\nXYZ can save 10% on its fuel cost\\nif its drivers refuel at a company owned fuel depot\\nrather than at a commercial truck stop.\\nThe goal here is 90%.\\nWe are currently at 70%.\\nNow you may ask, why our goal isn't 100%,\\ngiven that we get a cost savings of 10%\\nfor all fuel obtained from our own fuel depots?\\nWell, we can't get 100%,\\nbecause we don't have full coverage.\\nThere are some parts of our service area\\nwhere we don't yet have one of our own fuel depots.\\n\\nOkay, then why are we at 70% now\\nrather than at 90%?\\nWhy aren't our drivers getting the fuel at our own depots\\nwhen it's available?\\nWell, maybe the drivers just don't think it's important.\\nMaybe the drivers have an incentive to buy fuel elsewhere,\\nfor example, major truck stop chains\\nhave frequent filler rewards,\\njust like frequent flyer programs for airlines,\\nso that the drivers get personal benefits\\nfrom filling up their, at their favorite truck stop\\nrather than at the company depot.\\nRemember, the company pays for the fuel,\\nnot the drivers,\\nso the drivers don't suffer if the fuel costs a little more\\nand the drivers get the personal benefits\\nfrom filling up

might work,\\nbut I don't think it would have much effect.\\n\\nWhy not use this notion of KPIs\\nand performance evaluation on the drivers.\\nDo the same thing that I did with my sons\\nand the school bus in Hong Kong.\\nOffer to split the savings with the drivers.\\nIf a standard fill up saves the company 50 dollars\\nthen tell the drivers that you will give them\\n10 or 20 dollars of the savings.\\nNow consider the behavior of the drivers.\\nWill you ever have to speak with them again\\nabout this issue?\\nNo.\\nWith the proper measurement in place\\nthe numbers themselves will motivate the drivers\\nto do what you want them to do.\\n\\nThe drivers themselves will plan their refueling stops\\nto coincide with the locations of the company fuel depots.\\nSummary key point, and
