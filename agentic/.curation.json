[Instructor] We're starting a new chapter now,\\nand we're going to be taking a look at the AutoCAD interface.\\nSo we've got a new drawing for you.\\nThe new drawing is called Interface.dwg,\\nand you simply download it from the library\\nto follow along with the videos.\\nAs I mentioned in the intro to this course,\\nI'll always remind you what DWG file you need to have open\\nat the start of each video.\\nSo Interface.dwg, you've got it open in AutoCAD,\\nand it's a floor plan of an office building,\\nand you can see the grids, the dimensions,\\nthe desks, the chairs, et cetera.\\n\\nMake sure you are in the Model tab,\\nbottom left corner of your AutoCAD screen.\\nNow in this particular video,\\nwe're going to take a look at the application menu\\nand the Quick Access toolbar.\\nWe're going to dive into the interface a bit deeper\\nso that you can see the functionality\\nand how you can use it to your advantage.\\nSo application menu, where is that in the AutoCAD interface?\\nWell, if you look in the top left corner,\\nyou'll see a red square with a white A on it up here.\\n\\nSo it's this one here, there's the application menu there.\\nThere is a little fly out arrow next to it.\\nIf you click on that,\\nyou will see now that you are in the application menu.\\nNow it may look like there's a lot of stuff going on here.\\nThere isn't really, it's all just basic things\\nthat allow you to work with AutoCAD.\\nSo you'll notice we can open up a new file,\\nwe can open an existing file, we can save our file.\\nWe can Save As and save it\\nas lots of different file types, you'll notice.\\nSo we can save out as different file types,\\nsave it out as a drawing template,\\nsave it out as a drawing standards file.\\n\\nIf we come down the menu a little bit further,\\nDWG Convert is very useful.\\nIt allows you to convert your DWG file format.\\nAs I mentioned in the intro,\\nall of the exercise files are saved to AutoCAD 2013 DWG.\\nYou might want to convert that\\nto a more earlier version DWG for someone\\nwith an earlier version of AutoCAD to use the files.\\nThat's what DWG Convert does.\\nI can also import files such as PDFs,\\nDGNs, and other formats.\\nI can export out to many different file types,\\nsuch as DWF, DWFx, 3D DWF,\\nPDF, DGN, and other formats as well.\\n\\nIf I want to publish my drawings, there's a Publish option.\\nNow this is very cool.\\nYou can actually 3D print 3D models from AutoCAD.\\nI can archive my files,\\nI can eTransmit my files by sending them in,\\nsay a zip folder with all the necessary files\\nand DWGs that I need, I can email a drawing,\\nI can share a view of a drawing,\\nand I can also share a drawing using AutoCAD Web\\nand AutoCAD mobile.\\nUsing that little paper plane there shares a link\\nto the current version of the drawing,\\nincluding any external references.\\n\\nIf I want to print a file, I can go in,\\nI can do a preview, I can set my page setup,\\nI can manage my plotters that might be attached to AutoCAD.\\nAnd in the Drawing Utilities here, again,\\nlots of tools for you to investigate and have a go with.\\nSo you can set your drawing units,\\nyou can audit your drawings,\\nyou can check your drawing status.\\nIf I come down a bit further,\\nyou'll notice Drawing Recovery Manager.\\nThat'll display the drawings that may need to be recovered\\nafter a program or system failure\\nso you can recover files if they're corrupted.\\n\\nSo there's some very useful tools there.\\nNotice I can also close the current drawing or all drawings\\nif I've got more than one drawing open\\nin this particular session of AutoCAD.\\nNow you'll notice there's an Options button there as well.\\nNow just before I jump to that,\\nI'm going to go back up here\\nand just have a look at the Recent Documents\\nbecause I can do this by ordered list\\nby date, size, or type.\\nI can also change the look here\\nfrom small icons to, say large icons.\\nAnd as you can see, it's now a larger DWG icon.\\n\\nI can even go to images\\nso I can have large images of my files if I want to\\nso that I can recognize them.\\nWhen I hover over them, I get a preview,\\nand it tells me that that file's currently open\\nand the date it was saved, et cetera.\\nIf I go back there to small icons,\\nI get a bigger, more comprehensive list.\\nNotice there's a pin symbol next to each file name.\\nIf you are using drawings regularly,\\nyou can click on the pin\\nand it will always appear in the list.\\nOtherwise, that list is always updating\\nwith the most recent documents.\\n\\nNotice here as well, I can go to Open Documents.\\nSo these are the documents I have open right now.\\nI only have Interface.dwg open.\\nSo if I click back there,\\nthere's all my recent documents again.\\nLet's go back to that Options button and click on it.\\nThis will open up the Options dialogue box.\\nNow there's a lot of stuff in here\\nthat you really don't need to mess around with.\\nBasically, this is all of your options\\nthat allow AutoCAD to function.\\nIf I go to the Files tab,\\nthat's where all the file folders are\\nwhen AutoCAD is installed.\\n\\nSo you've got things like your Support File Search Path.\\nIf I expand that out,\\nyou can see there there's a lot going on with that.\\nIf I go to Display, that sets all my Display settings,\\nmy Open and Save settings.\\nThere's my 2013,\\nsave as 2013 (audio distortion drowns out speaker) DWG.\\nPlotting and publishing, System settings, User Preferences,\\nany Drafting settings I want to change, 3D Modeling.\\nAnything that I want to change involving selection is\\nin the Selection tab.\\nI can even set up differing profiles\\nthat have differing settings within AutoCAD as well.\\n\\nSo there's a lot going on there\\nin that Options dialogue box.\\nAgain, it's another thing to investigate,\\nbut just be careful because a lot\\nof those settings are default settings.\\nI'll give you an idea of that.\\nIf I go to the Display tab,\\nthe Crosshair size is always a default of five.\\nSo remember that, and then you know that it's always five.\\nWrite it down somewhere if you need to.\\nBut if you make that bigger like that,\\nyour crosshair then becomes larger out here.\\nSo if I now Apply that and OK it,\\nyou see my crosshair is now way huge.\\n\\nIf I right click on the mouse and Repeat OPTIONS,\\nthat'll take me back into the Options dialogue box.\\nAnd you need to remember that it's five by default.\\nYou can't just get it back to the default setting.\\nSo I'll Apply that, OK it,\\nand now the crosshair is back to five again.\\nYou can see it's smaller there.\\nSo that's the Options dialogue box covered\\nas part of the application menu.\\nWhat about that Quick Access toolbar?\\nWell, that exists at the top of the screen here like so,\\nand it just gives you quick access\\nto the command you might use regularly,\\nsuch as New, Open, Save, Save As,\\nand the incredibly useful Undo and Redo.\\n\\nThey're incredibly handy when you make a mistake.\\nYou can also share your files,\\nlike I mentioned in the application menu as well.\\nThere's a quick icon there to share your files too.\\nNow if you look,\\nthere's a little white sort of down arrow icon.\\nIf I click on that,\\nit allows me to customize the Quick Access toolbar.\\nSo anything that's ticked there is displayed\\non the toolbar already.\\nSelect Layer.\\nNow you can look at your layers in the Quick Access toolbar,\\nwhich means you don't have to go to the Layers panel here\\non the Home tab on the ribbon\\nand go to the layer drop down there.\\n\\nSo basically you can be in any tab on the ribbon\\nand you can now check your layers\\nfrom the Quick Access toolbar.\\nIncredibly useful.\\nJump back to the Home tab on the ribbon\\nand keep your Layers switched on\\non the Quick Access toolbar.\\nIt's a very handy one to have.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4003082\",\"duration\":238,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Working with the AutoCAD ribbon and

[Instructor] Staying in our interface.dwg file,\\nand we're going to take a look now at the AutoCAD ribbon\\nand AutoCAD ribbon panels,\\nand how they work.\\nSo the ribbon is normally located\\nat the top of your AutoCAD screen.\\nNow, by default, it will open in the Home tab.\\nYou do have lots of other tabs.\\nYou have the Insert tab, the Annotate tab,\\nthe Parametric tab, the View tab.\\nYou've got Manage, Output, Collaborate,\\nand if you're running with full AutoCAD,\\nnot AutoCAD LT,\\nyou can also work with the AutoCAD Express tools.\\n\\nSo there's lots of different tabs in the ribbon.\\nI'll click back on the Home tab.\\nNow, you'll notice that the ribbon\\nis divided into specific panels.\\nSo if you're drawing something,\\nyou would use the commands in the Draw panel here.\\nIf you're modifying geometry or objects,\\nyou would use the Modify panel here.\\nIf you're working with annotations,\\nsuch as text and dimensions,\\nyou might use the Annotation panel here.\\nNow, each of these panels has a specific use.\\n\\nSo when you go to the Annotate tab on the ribbon,\\nyou're working with text,\\ndimensions, center lines,\\nleaders, tables, markups and annotation scaling.\\nSo there's lots of different tools\\non each of the tabs on the ribbon.\\nAgain, jump back to the Home tab on the ribbon.\\nNow, I just want to show you\\nhow some of the functionality works within the ribbon\\nso that you're used to it,\\nand then obviously it builds up that muscle memory\\nso that you remember how these things work.\\nI'm going to utilize the Home tab on the ribbon\\nand the Draw panel here, top left.\\n\\nNow, you'll notice each of these commands\\nhas a little icon that goes with it normally,\\nbut notice there are flyouts\\nunderneath some of the commands.\\nSo for example, if I click on the flyout underneath Circle,\\nthere's lots of different circle types\\nthat you can place in AutoCAD.\\nSame with Arc, if I click there,\\nlots of different arc types\\nthat you can use within AutoCAD.\\nI'll leave it up to you to investigate how they all work,\\nbut that's how you work with the ribbon.\\nYou click on the flyout\\nto expand the command functionality.\\n\\nNow, if I click on the title bar,\\nyou'll see that also it expands the panel as well.\\nThere's a little pin,\\nclick on the pin,\\nthat holds that expanded panel out\\nuntil you click on the pin again and unpin it,\\nand it goes back into the ribbon again.\\nSo that's how you work with the ribbon tabs,\\nthe ribbon panels\\nand all the flyouts on the ribbon.\\nNow, there's one more little trick\\nI want to show you here,\\nand a lot of new users to AutoCAD absolutely freak out\\nwhen this happens\\nbecause they think that they've broken AutoCAD.\\n\\nYou haven't, there's a little white button\\njust there at the top of the ribbon.\\nCan you see it there?\\nWith a little up arrow on it.\\nWhat that does is it takes you through different displays\\nof the ribbon in AutoCAD.\\nSo if I click on it once,\\nthe ribbon changes.\\nNow, it hasn't broken AutoCAD.\\nIf I hover over Draw, there's Draw, there's Modify,\\nI've still got the ribbon tabs along the top.\\nIf I click on that little white button again,\\n(laughing) it kind of disappears even more.\\n\\nThere's Draw, there's Modify,\\nthere's Annotation,\\nthere's the ribbon tabs there.\\nClick on it one more time\\nand people freak out even more\\nbecause it seems to have disappeared even further.\\nIt hasn't, they're there, look.\\nThere's Home, there's Insert.\\nClick on it, there's the Home,\\nthere's the Insert, there's the Annotate.\\nOne last click,\\nand it takes me back to the default view of the ribbon.\\nSo I'll click on the Home tab again.\\nAll you got to do with that little white button is,\\nif you click on it by mistake,\\njust keep clicking.\\nThere's four different settings to the ribbon.\\n\\nYou will get back to the default one\\nthat you can see on the screen\\nif you just keep clicking methodically\\nand keeping an eye on what the ribbon does.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3997425\",\"duration\":347,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using dialog boxes and palettes in

[Instructor] Once again,\\nwe're staying in our Interface.dwg file,\\nand in this particular video,\\nwe're going to take a look at dialogue boxes\\nand palettes in AutoCAD.\\nNow, dialogue boxes and palettes in AutoCAD\\nare fundamental to how you work with AutoCAD.\\nThey're really important,\\nand dialogue boxes are fundamental\\nin all Windows operating system products anyway.\\nYou'll always get dialogue boxes popping up.\\n\\nPalettes, however, are specific to AutoCAD,\\nand there is a subtle difference,\\nand I'm just going to explain those differences\\nso that you have an idea\\nof how they work in the AutoCAD application.\\nSo let's take a look at a typical dialogue box\\nyou might use in AutoCAD.\\nNow I'm in the home tab on the ribbon again.\\nI'm going to go up here to the annotation panel.\\nI'm going to click on the arrow there, the flyout arrow,\\nand just pin it open, like so, so that's pinned open.\\n\\nNow the annotation flyout here\\nis all about your styles within your AutoCAD drawings.\\nSo we have text styles, dimension styles,\\nmulti-leader styles, and table styles,\\nand then you go and select a style that you want to use\\nfrom the flyout there, like so.\\nNow I'm not too worried about the flyout bit.\\nWhat I am worried about is a dialogue box.\\nSee the A with the paintbrush?\\nThat will go to your text styles.\\nSo if I click there on text style,\\nthat will open up the text style dialogue box.\\n\\nNow how do I know that that is a dialogue box?\\nTwo simple ways of knowing that that is a dialogue box\\nare that it says text style\\nin a title bar at the top of the dialogue box,\\nand you'll often have tick boxes.\\nNotice I'm ticking upside down and unticking upside down.\\nYou might also have what they call radio buttons,\\nwhere you switch settings on and off,\\nbut this is a dialogue box,\\nand the good thing about dialogue boxes in AutoCAD,\\nyou can hover over the edge of them,\\nclick on the edge and drag, make it bigger, make it smaller.\\n\\nIt will only go to a preset size, though.\\nNotice I can't make it disappear by making it smaller,\\nand it's the same vertically as well,\\nclick and drag there like that,\\nand I can also hover on the corner\\nand do that almost like\\nwith an aspect ratio diagonally, like so.\\nIf I drag that all the way back in, though,\\nyou'll notice it goes to a default size.\\nSo that is a dialogue box,\\nand there's hundreds of them in AutoCAD.\\nYou'll find them as you work through\\nand start working with AutoCAD.\\n\\nNow we haven't made any changes\\nin the text style dialogue box,\\nso I'll click on cancel and that will close it.\\nSo that's a dialogue box.\\nSo click on the pin here to close the annotation flyout,\\nand it goes back into the ribbon.\\nNow one of the most commonly used palettes\\nthat you will use in AutoCAD\\nis your layer properties manager,\\nand you'll find that on the home tab,\\non the ribbon in the layers panel.\\nYou do not need to expand the layers panel.\\nLayer properties is right there.\\nClick on layer properties,\\nand there's your layer properties manager palette.\\n\\nNow you'll notice the palette,\\nthe title bar is at the side vertically.\\nIt says layer properties manager,\\nand there are some little tools there\\nthat you can play around with.\\nNow you can resize, like you can the dialog box,\\nbut notice it gets to a certain size again.\\nLike a dialog box, you can only make it so small.\\nKeep the layer properties manager\\nnicely expanded out horizontally, though,\\nbecause you can obviously expand here\\nwith all your different columns\\nand make things bigger and smaller.\\nCan you see that?\\nSo that's one of the functions of a palette\\nthat's incredibly useful.\\n\\nThere are some other functions of a palette\\nthat are useful, though.\\nSee this one here?\\nHover over it and it'll say auto hide.\\nClick on it.\\nNow all you see is the title bar,\\nbut if you hover over the title bar,\\nit displays it like so.\\nIf I click again on auto hide, it stays open.\\nNotice here I've got settings or properties of the palette.\\nI can change the transparency of the palette.\\nSo at the moment it's 100% opaque.\\nI can't see through it.\\nIf I bring that all the way down here,\\ncan you see with when I'm dragging that bar?\\nI can make it opaque and transparent if I want to.\\n\\nI'm going to take that all the way back up to 100 again.\\nSo you can change the transparency of your palette.\\nSo I'll just click on cancel there.\\nAlso you can click and drag, you'll notice,\\nand when you drag it to one side, it will dock, like so.\\nSo it's actually docked now.\\nIt's not going to move anymore,\\nand I can go to my layers that way.\\nCan you see there's a little bunch of dots there?\\nClick and drag, drag it back out again,\\nand you can drag it back out onto the screen,\\nand as you drag it around,\\ncan you see if you touch on each side of the screen,\\nthe actual title bar of the palette\\nbounces off of each side.\\n\\nYou can also dock them quite happily.\\nIf you right click here,\\nyou can anchor left or anchor right,\\nso you can either decide\\non which side of the screen you want.\\nAuto hide is also available\\nwhen you right click on the title bar as well.\\nMove size and close are also available,\\nso if I click on close, that will close it,\\nand I need to go back up to the icon\\nto open the layer properties palette again.\\nNow again, I've spoken at length about those there.\\nI'll leave it up to you now\\nto go and investigate the AutoCAD commands\\nand find some dialog boxes\\nand find some palettes to look at and see how they work.\\n\\nOne of the good ways of checking out palettes,\\na quick one is to go to the view tab\\nand there's a palettes panel\\nthat shows you lots of different palettes\\nthat are available in AutoCAD.\\nJump back to the home tab on the ribbon,\\nand we'll move on to the next

AutoCAD interface if you exclude the ribbon,\\nwhere you obviously desperately need that\\nbecause you can't drive AutoCAD otherwise,\\nbut it's the status bar in the bottom right corner\\nof your AutoCAD application window.\\nIn that status bar, you can set all\\nof your drafting settings and things like object snaps,\\npolar tracking, ortho, and so on.\\n\\nAll of these tools allow you to draft accurately,\\nprecisely, and effectively in AutoCAD.\\nNow, these settings allow you to work really, really quickly\\nand easily with certain processes within AutoCAD itself.\\nNow, the status bar is controlled by these little\\nthree lines in the bottom right corner.\\nIf you hover over that, it will say customization.\\nNow, just move away from that and put the cross hair\\nsomewhere in the drawing area, just move the cross hair,\\nyou do that using the mouse like you would anything else\\non a Windows based application.\\n\\nNow, AutoCAD by default runs with a thing called\\ndynamic input or dynmode, D-Y-N-M-O-D-E.\\nSo without clicking on the mouse or anything,\\nyou can just start typing, type the word line,\\nand you'll see it appears next to the cross hair,\\nand you can see the line command appears there\\non what is known as the suggestion menu.\\nAutoCAD is suggesting any command that has the word line\\nin it in that suggestion menu, and you can just slide up\\nand down like so and find the command that you need.\\n\\nNow, the line command is a pretty obvious command,\\nit creates straight line segments.\\nIt's also up here, you'll notice on the draw panel\\non the home tab on the ribbon, it's one of the most basic\\nand most commonly used AutoCAD commands,\\nbut the dynamic input is allowing me to do that\\nnext to the cross hair.\\nSo it's a bit like watching a foreign movie,\\nif you see what I mean.\\nSo instead of the subtitles at the bottom of the screen,\\nyou're seeing them where you're designing\\nwith the cross hair.\\nNow, that dynamic input is on by default,\\njust hit escape a couple of times just to cancel\\nany commands or any typing that you've done.\\n\\nNow, dynamic input isn't normally displayed\\non the status bar.\\nSo you go down to the customization icon here\\nand click on it, and go up to the top near this,\\nthere you go, dynamic input, there it is there.\\nClick on it, and you'll see a little tick appear next to it.\\nThat means it's now displayed on your status bar.\\nCome down to units as well.\\nThere's units, it's not ticked, we'll click on that one\\nas well, and then we'll click on the little three lines,\\nthe customization icon again.\\nSo what we've done there is we've switched on\\nto different settings on the status bar.\\n\\nThere's the unit, says decimal, click on the fly out,\\nit's letting us know that the decimal setting is being used\\nat the moment for units in our AutoCAD drawing.\\nClick away from that just by clicking once\\nin the drawing area.\\nDynamic input is this

circular tables there.\\nSo a bit of zooming and panning,\\nlike so, to get into that space there.\\nGet it front and center\\nso that you zoom in nice and tight on the area.\\nZoom into areas to make sure you can see what you're doing\\nso that you can draft a model with accuracy in AutoCAD.\\n\\nNow, we're going to create a simple table\\nusing some polar tracking and some object snaps\\nso that we can see how they interact with each other\\nto allow us to draw accurately and precisely.\\nSo we're going to go down to our status bar.\\nNow, you'll notice down here I've got polar tracking on.\\nCan you see that?\\nLooks like a slice of pie out of a pie dish.\\nThat one there.\\nClick on the arrow next to it.\\nMake sure your angle increments are set to 90 degrees.\\n\\nWe're also going to come down here.\\nMake sure this one's on.\\nObject snap tracking.\\nThat's just an on or off.\\nThere's no values to worry about.\\nAnd then here's your object snaps.\\nLittle flyer arrow there.\\nClick on that one.\\nJust make sure that these object snaps are ticked:\\nendpoint, midpoint, center,\\nintersection, and extension.\\nYou simply click next to the object snap name that you need.\\nSo if I wanted node on,\\nclick on it, tick appears,\\nclick on it again, tick goes off.\\nBut you want endpoint, midpoint, center,\\nintersection, extension.\\n\\nMove into the drawing area, click once,\\nand that gets rid of the menu on the screen.\\nNow, we're going to draw a simple rectangle in this space.\\nSo before we do that though,\\nwe want to be on the right layer.\\nSo you've got a choice here.\\nRemember in the previous chapter\\nwe did set up our layer dropdown here\\non the quick access toolbar.\\nCan you see that?\\nOr you can go to the layers panel here\\non the home tab on the ribbon,\\ngo to the layer dropdown here.\\nYou want to be using this layer:\\nA-700-M_FFE.\\n\\nMake sure you're on that layer\\n'cause that's what everything else is on.\\nIf you hover over that, can you see?\\nThat is on that A-700-M_FFE.\\nUp to the draw panel on the home tab,\\nthere's draw.\\nAnd we're going to go up here to this one here,\\nclick on the fly out and select rectangle.\\nCome into the drawing area,\\npick a point about there and left click.\\nAs you drag the mouse after clicking,\\nyou can now see\\nthat you're basically performing\\na rectangle command\\nto create a rectangle.\\n\\nNow you'll notice one of the values there\\nis highlighted in blue.\\nI can now, using what they call direct distance entry,\\ntype in the sizes of my rectangle.\\nSo I type in 2500.\\nThis drawing is in metric millimeters, by the way.\\nSo that's 2,500 millimeters, which is 2.5 meters.\\nPress the Tab key on the keyboard,\\ntabs you to the other value,\\nthat's going to be 1500, like so.\\nAgain, just tab it again.\\nCan you see both values are now locked?\\nSo when you press Enter to finish the rectangle command,\\nyou know that both those values have been locked in.\\n\\nNow when you hover over the rectangle,\\nit'll let you know that it is an AutoCAD polyline\\non the layer that we set up previously.\\nAll rectangles are closed polylines,\\nthey're one object.\\nNow we're going to add some arcs to pretty up our table.\\nSo we're going to go back to the draw panel,\\nclick on the arc fly out here,\\nand we're going to go with start, center, end.\\nNow we want to start down here.\\nIf we hover on this corner,\\ncan you see our endpoint object snap appears?\\nSo that's why we've got those object snaps switched on.\\n\\nLeft click.\\nI come up, drag upwards,\\nthere's the midpoint.\\nSee the midpoint snap?\\nThat's the center of our arc.\\nLeft click.\\nand left click again,\\nthere's our start, center, end.\\nNow we're going to go back up to the arc fly out again\\nand we're going to go start, center, end again.\\nWe're going to start this side this time though.\\nCan you see?\\nOther sort of end of the line.\\nLeft click on the endpoint snap,\\ndown to the midpoint snap,\\nleft click again,\\ndown to the endpoint snap,\\nleft click again.\\n\\nNow the reason we do that is arcs, by default,\\ngo counterclockwise in AutoCAD.\\nSo we're just making sure that we follow\\nthe start, center, end\\nin a counterclockwise fashion.\\nThat's why we did it in those orders\\nof those object snaps.\\nNow, you'll remember I asked you to switch this one on here.\\nObject snap tracking.\\nThis is very clever.\\nSo we're going to go to the draw panel again,\\nhover over the circle fly out and click on it.\\nYou want

[Instructor] We're staying in our Geometry.dwg file,\\nand we are going to stay on the layer\\nthat we set in the previous video as well\\nwhen we created our table here.\\nNow what I'd like you to do\\nis just zoom into any area around the table you've created.\\nI'm going to pan up a little bit\\nand zoom in a touch here like so.\\nI'm going to work underneath the table that we've created.\\nNow it's up to you where you work in that space,\\nbut I'm going to work underneath the table\\nthat we created previously.\\n\\nI'm going to show you now how polar tracking\\nand ortho in your drafting settings down on the status bar\\nallow you to draft in different ways.\\nWe're going to create a square table using polar tracking.\\nWe're going to use a square table as well,\\nbut we're going to develop it using ortho as well.\\nNow, polar tracking is down here on the status bar.\\nAnd as I mentioned to you earlier,\\non the fly out there,\\nyou can select which angle increment you want to be using.\\nSo make sure it's still set to 90.\\n\\nAnd then what we're going to do,\\nwe're going to go up to the Line command here\\non the draw panel.\\nSo click on the Line command, come into the drawing area.\\nI'm going to click down here, left click,\\nand as I drag vertically upwards,\\ncan you see I'm getting an increment of 90 degrees?\\nIt is actually a value of 90 degrees,\\nand it gives me that direct distance entry\\nin the blue highlight there.\\nSo if I type in 1500, 1500 millimeters and press Enter,\\nI've now drawn a line\\nthat is exactly vertical at 90 degrees that was 1500 long.\\n\\nThe next line segment in the Line command,\\nif I drag to the right, can you see now?\\nI'm getting another increment of 90 degrees,\\nbut it's zero by default,\\nto the east to the right is zero degrees in AutoCAD.\\nAgain, I'll type in 1500 in that box, press Enter,\\nand can you see the polar tracking\\nis giving me specific angles I can work with\\nat 90 degree increments?\\nI'll drag downwards now,\\nagain, polar tracking kicks,\\nin another 90 degree increment.\\n\\n270 degrees is displayed on the screen.\\nType in 1500 again.\\nPress Enter to finish.\\nAnd you can see now\\nthat it's just waiting for that last segment.\\nA little tip and trick here for you.\\nIf you get to that point,\\njust right click and select close on the shortcut menu.\\nAnd it closes back to the point we first started.\\nWe don't have to drag and type in another distance.\\nSo that's utilizing polar tracking\\nor the polar setting in AutoCAD.\\n\\nSo that's down here on the status bar,\\nthere's polar tracking.\\nNow the one to the left of it is ortho or ortho mode.\\nIf I click on that,\\nyou'll notice polar tracking turns off.\\nNow there's a reason for that.\\nYou can only have one running at any given time,\\northo or polar.\\nSo let's do the same table.\\nWe'll replicate it, but we'll use ortho.\\nSo back up to the Line command on the draw panel.\\nCome into the drawing area, I'm going to left click\\nand there's my line.\\n\\nBut you'll notice now I can only when I move the mouse,\\ndraw horizontally or vertically.\\nOrthogonal or ortho constrain you to the X and Y directions.\\nSo horizontally or vertically.\\nSo if I drag upwards now,\\nI can still type in my 1500,\\nmy direct distance entry and press Enter.\\nBut this time no polar tracking lines 'cause ortho is on.\\nSo 1500, dragging it to the right,\\ndrag downwards again, can you see?\\nOrtho kicks in, still 270 degrees.\\n\\n1500 again and Enter.\\nAnd then right click and close\\nand it closes back to where we started.\\nSo it depends on which methodology you want to use,\\northo is great\\nif you want to rigidly work horizontally and vertically.\\nPolar is great though.\\nIf I put polar back on,\\nclick on it there, you'll notice ortho turns off,\\nclick there, I've got different angle increments I can use.\\nBut at the bottom there, it says tracking settings.\\nClick on tracking settings,\\ntakes us into the drafting settings dialogue box\\nin the polar tracking tab.\\n\\nSo there again are my angle increments,\\nbut also I can add individual additional angles\\nby ticking this box here, clicking on new.\\nAnd I can put a value in there if I need to.\\nI'll untick that again like so.\\nSo polar tracking gives you a bit more flexibility\\nthan ortho does.\\nBut if you're working with ortho\\nand you can only go up and down, you might want that\\nso that you know that all of your lines\\nare vertical and horizontal and perpendicular to each other.\\nSo it's up to you which methodology you use.\\n\\nI'll just click on cancel there just to close that.\\nBut again, this is something a little bit\\nof a call to action for you where you can go away now\\nand explore polar tracking and explore orthogonal\\nas you're drafting settings in your AutoCAD drawings.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4000278\",\"duration\":311,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating lines, arcs, and circles in

objects,\\nright click and erasing them.\\n\\nNow we're going to draw that table with the circle in it again,\\nbut we're going to utilize the Polyline command.\\nNow this is where you use a lot of direct distance entry\\nand quite a bit of right clicking,\\nso just pay attention to what I do first.\\nMaybe watch the video first and then have a go at it,\\nbecause there's quite a little bit of involved clicking\\nand moving around.\\nWe're staying on the same layer.\\nWe're going to go up to the draw panel\\nand click on Polyline this time.\\nThere's Polyline, click on it,\\ncome into the drawing area.\\nI'm going to left click here.\\n\\nAnd then using my polar tracking, drag to the right\\nand type in 2500 enter.\\nVery much like the line command so far,\\nbut this is where Polylines

the Polyline command.\\nMake sure that you polar tracking's kicking in,\\ntype in 1500 and enter for the diameter of your arc.\\n\\nNow you're still in arc mode, but we need to draw a line,\\nso we right click, we go to the line mode again here,\\ndrag to the left.\\nAnd as you can see, we're now dragging\\nusing our polar tracking again.\\nDo 2500 like we did for the previous line segment\\nin the Polyline and press enter.\\nNow we need to close that out with an arc.\\nSo we right click again and select arc.\\nAnd now we just go to that object snap.\\nSee the end point object snap?\\nLeft click on it and you can see we've drawn our Polyline.\\n\\nNow obviously it's still trying to draw another arc segment,\\nso just press enter once\\nand that takes you out of the Polyline command.\\nYou've now placed a Polyline\\nthat is formed of line and arc segments.\\nVery quick and easy.\\nNow we're going to go back to the draw panel\\nand click on the circle fly out there\\nand go center radius.\\nCome into the drawing area and like we've done previously,\\nwe're going to hover on that midpoint there.\\nHover on that midpoint there using our object snap tracking.\\n\\nWhen we get the intersections, left click, drag outwards,\\nand we're going to go for a circle radius of 650.\\nPress enter, there's our circle.\\nNow our circle looks great,\\nbut wouldn't it be nice\\nif we could have a hexagonal insert instead?\\nWell you can.\\nYou can do that using the polygon command.\\nSo let's go up to the draw panel.\\nRemember rectangle is here.\\nClick on the rectangle fly out and go to polygon.\\n\\nCome into the drawing area\\nand you get a default number of sides, which is four.\\nYou can have any number of sides from three upwards\\nwith the polygon command.\\nNow a hexagon has six,\\nso we type in six for our number of sides,\\nand press enter to confirm that.\\nNow it wants the center of the polygon.\\nNow you'll remember we preset some object snap.\\nOne of those was the center snap.\\nSo if I touch on the edge of the circle,\\ncan you see there, the center snap appears.\\nI don't even need to go into the center of the circle.\\n\\nYou can, there it is there,\\nbut you can just touch on the circle.\\nNow as soon as I click on that center snap,\\nI get prompted for two different types of polygon.\\nYou can have inscribed or circumscribed.\\nInscribed is inscribed inside the boundary of the circle.\\nCircumscribed is about the circle\\nand touches on the outside of the circle.\\nWe're going to go for inscribed,\\nand there it is there.\\njust drag upwards until we get an intersection snap there.\\nCan you see that?\\nThe little green X?\\nWhen you see that green X appear when you touch the circle\\nleft click.\\n\\nNow you could leave the circle there if you wanted to.\\nIt looks nice with the circle,\\nbut you can just now click on the circle like that,\\nright click and erase.\\nThere we go.\\nNice table with a hexagonal insert.\\nOkay, let's zoom out a little bit now.\\nWe've done obviously Polylines and polygons.\\nI'd like you to zoom out and pan\\nand zoom in on this little area just here.\\nCan you see this group of tables with the green cross on it?\\nYou want to be about there.\\nNow we're going to place basically a wiggly line.\\n\\nIt's what they call an irregular curve,\\nand it utilizes a command called spline in AutoCAD.\\nNow before we do that,\\ngo over to the utilities panel on the home tab\\non the ribbon.\\nClick on this fly out here that says measure\\nand click on quick.\\nWhen you move around now,\\ncan you see wherever your cross hair goes\\nit lets you know measurements.\\nSo if I hover over that little wall there,\\ncan you see that wall is 120.65 wide.\\n\\nCan you see that, the little orange number there?\\nSo that's great.\\nCome out of that wall and just hit escape a couple of times\\nto come out of quick measure.\\nWe're going to go up to the draw panel\\nand click on the fly out and pin it open.\\nAnd there is a spline command there, spline fit,\\nthere's also spline CV.\\nWe're just going to do a spline fit for now.\\nClick on spline fit, come into the drawing area,\\nand you need to snap to the corner of the wall.\\n\\nNow to see that you might need to zoom in a bit,\\nand you want that end point snap there.\\nLeft click.\\nThen as you come out, move away from the corner,\\njust roll back on the wheel a few notches,\\nand maybe pan a little bit so that you can see\\npast the furniture.\\nNow a spline is an irregular curve, as I said.\\nSo if I go up a bit, left click,\\ncome down a bit again, left click.\\nUp a bit again, and I'm kind of moving in a diagonal motion,\\ncreating a snake-like irregular curve.\\n\\nKeep going until you get to about there\\nand just press enter to finish.\\nThere's your spline.\\nIf you hover over that, it'll tell you it's a spline\\nand it's on our current layer, that FFE layer.\\nNow you remember we measured a distance, didn't we,\\nusing quick measure?\\n120.65.\\nGo up to the modify panel\\nand select your little offset command here.\\nClick on it, come into the drawing area.\\n\\nIt's asking for an offset distance.\\nType in 120.65.\\nEnter to confirm that distance, click on your spline,\\nselect it, and it'll go a purpley color.\\nCome downwards so that the orange offset object is below.\\nYou don't want it above, you want it below.\\nCan you see the orange is below?\\nLeft click to confirm that offset.\\nSo what you've done there is you've given that a thickness\\nthe same as the wall to the right in the drawing there.\\n\\nPress enter to finish the offset command.\\nYou're going to go to the line command\\nand draw a little line from endpoint to endpoint\\nand press enter to confirm.\\nYou're then going to zoom in on this area here.\\nYou see where we came off the corner?\\nYou now need to extend this spline to this wall edge here.\\nSo we go up to the modify panel again.\\nRemember, trim is there, click on the fly out,\\nand select extend this time.\\nAnd we just click on the end of the spline\\nand it extends to the nearest wall line.\\n\\nPress enter to finish the extend command.\\nYou can unpin the draw panel now,\\nand we'll zoom out a little bit,\\nand we've created a nice curvy wall that acts as a break\\nbetween the stair area\\nand where the sofas and the chairs are.\\nNow we need to match the properties of the splines\\nand that little line at the end to the wall here.\\nThat's very easy to do.\\nHome tab on the ribbon, go to match properties\\nhere on the properties panel,\\nselect the green line of the wall, that one there,\\nand just click on each spline.\\n\\nWhen you click, you'll see it change, the properties change.\\nRemember to get the little end line at the end\\nand then enter to finish,\\nand you've utilized your spline command\\nto create a nice curvy dividing wall.\\nDouble click on the wheel of the mouse to zoom extents.\\nGood CAD practice to do so when you're finishing up.\\nAlways zoom to extents,\\nready to save your drawing,\\nin case you're leaving work that day\\nand someone else might log into that drawing the next day.\\nThen when they go into it, it's all zoomed out to extents\\nand they can see what's going

AutoCAD DWG files.\\nNow, in order to do that,\\nyou need to be able to create styles\\nfor that annotation as well.\\nWe've got a new drawing for you.\\nIt's called Annotation.dwg, surprise surprise.\\nYou can download it from the library\\nto follow along with the videos in this particular chapter.\\n\\nNow, in this video, what we're going to do\\nis we're going to start looking at text styles,\\nso these are the styles that we would use\\nfor our text annotation.\\nSo we're talking things like labels, notes,\\nanything that would go on a drawing\\nto communicate a design intent.\\nSo let's take a look at text styles.\\nWhat we do need to do is make sure\\nthat we're on the appropriate layer.\\nNow, at the moment, the layer is set to A010D_dim.\\n\\nThat will be fine for now.\\nThere are other layers available for text and so on as well,\\nbut that's our dimensions layer for the moment.\\nNow, it doesn't matter that we're on the dimensions layer\\nand we're setting up a text style.\\nWe can change the layer later, okay?\\nDon't worry about that too much,\\nbut get into the habit of checking your layer\\nevery time you open a new drawing.\\nSo in this particular instance,\\nwe've checked and we know that we're on a dimensions layer.\\n\\nNow, in order to create text styles,\\nI would suggest that you go to the home tab on the ribbon\\nand use the annotation flyout here and pin it open.\\nThere is the text style icon right there.\\nNow you can also go to the annotate tab\\nand using the text panel here,\\nyou can click here on this little arrow.\\nThat will also open up the text style dialogue box.\\nI'm going to cancel that.\\nI'm going to go back to the home tab,\\nand you'll notice the annotation panel there\\nhas unpinned itself, 'cause I went to a different ribbon tab\\nso I'll just pin it open again.\\n\\nI'm going to click on the A with the paintbrush,\\nand I'm going to create some new text styles\\nfor this particular drawing.\\nNow, at the moment, we've got some default ones in there.\\nStandard is the current one,\\nand as you can see, the font isn't that great.\\nClick on new,\\nand the style name that we're going to create first\\nis dims for dimensions,\\nand then underscore and MODEL in caps like that.\\nNow I have a particular way of naming my annotation styles.\\n\\nSo this means that this is a text style\\nfor dimension text, dims_MODEL.\\nIt should only be used in the model tab.\\nNow you don't need to specify a height\\nin the style name for this one.\\nI'm going to click on OK,\\nI'm going to click here on the font name, click on the arrow,\\nand in any Windows based application,\\nwhen that dropdown appears,\\ntype the first letter of the font name that you want.\\nI'm going to type C for Calibri.\\n\\nThere's Calibri there, I select it.\\nCan you see the preview changes to the Calibri font?\\nFont style will be regular height will not be annotative,\\nso leave that unticked, and it will also be zero.\\nIf you leave the height at zero,\\nit means AutoCAD kind of asks for the height\\nwhen you're placing text using dims_MODEL as a style.\\nNow, the reason we're creating this text style\\nis for dimension text in dimensions when we're placing them.\\nSo we don't need to worry about the height.\\n\\nIt should be zero,\\nbecause the dimension's style will specify the text height.\\nEverything else can be left as is.\\nClick on Apply.\\nDo not click on Close.\\nWe need to go to New again,\\nand we're going to create one\\ncalled Labels_MODEL_300mm, 300 millimeters.\\nThis is being used real size in the model tab,\\nhence the name of the style.\\n\\nClick on OK.\\nSo Labels_MODEL_300 millimeters.\\nSelect it in the list.\\nIt's taken on board Calibri\\nfrom the previous text style that we created.\\nIt's using a font style of regular, which is what we want,\\nbut we need to give it a height of 300,\\nso it goes with the name of the text style.\\nAgain, we don't need any effects\\nor width factors or oblique angles.\\nJust click on Apply,\\nthen select Labels_MODEL_300 millimeters.\\n\\nSet it as the current text style\\nby clicking on the Set Current button.\\nThen click on Close.\\nYou'll notice now, can you see Labels_MODEL_300 milimeters\\nis the current text style in your drawing.\\nYou can unpin the annotation flyout there, like so.\\nThat goes back into the ribbon,\\nand you're now ready to start\\nthinking about some text annotation in your drawing.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2029213\",\"duration\":421,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating single line text (TEXT) and multiline

[Lecturer] We're staying in our annotation.DWG file,\\nand in the previous video we set up some text styles.\\nWe're now going to put one of those text styles into use\\nin the drawing itself\\nby creating some multi-line text\\nand some single line text.\\nWe're going to zoom in on this conference room here,\\nbottom left corner.\\nSo using zoom and pan,\\nget the cross hair over the conference table,\\nzoom in, pan up a little bit\\nso that we're front and center there\\nand we can really see what we're doing.\\n\\nNow what's the next thing you should check?\\nCheck your layer.\\nIf you're placing text,\\nyou want to make sure it's on a text layer.\\nSo do you remember in the previous video\\nI talked about the fact that it didn't matter\\nwhat layer you were using\\nwhen you were creating your text style\\nas long as you were aware of it.\\nSo we'll go to the layer dropdown\\nand what you'll find is as we scroll down and up,\\nyou can see that there is a text layer there.\\nCan you see it?\\nZ-0-0-0-T text.\\n\\nNow that particular layer there could be used,\\nlet's have a look.\\nAre there any other text layers in there?\\nIf you're not happy with the text layer\\nthat you want to use,\\nlet's just jump in and create a new layer.\\nNow you can quickly do this just clicking here on New Layer\\nin the layer properties manager,\\nI've clicked on layer properties in the layers panel,\\nclick on new layer.\\nLet's just create a new layer and call it text,\\nquick and easy like that.\\nClick on the color box\\nand we'll select red, this index color one here.\\n\\nClick on okay,\\nand we've now created a new layer called text.\\nTo make it the current layer,\\ncan you see there's a little sheet of paper\\nto the left of the word text?\\nDouble click on that, little green tick appears,\\ncurrent layer text in the layer properties manager.\\nClose the layer properties manager like so.\\nAnd can you see text is now our current layer?\\nNow I know we've given it a really simplistic name there,\\nbut sometimes you do need to create a new layer\\nbefore you start placing annotation,\\nobjects, geometry,\\nit's always worth checking that out.\\n\\nWe don't really want our text\\non the dimensions layer and vice versa,\\nwe don't want our dimensions on the text layer.\\nSo you need to have two separate layers.\\nWe're now going to place some multi-line text,\\nbut before we do that,\\nwe check our text style.\\nHome tab on the ribbon,\\nclick on the annotation fly out here and pin it open.\\nYou can see labels, model, 300 millimeters.\\nIf I click on the fly out there,\\nthere's all my text styles,\\nyou want labels, model, 300 millimeters like so.\\n\\nNow you can leave that annotation panel pinned open.\\nI'm just going to pan down slightly\\n'cause I want to place my\\nmulti-line text in this corner here.\\nI'm going to go to the text fly out\\nand select multi-line text.\\nNow the nice thing about multi-line text\\nis you specify an area where the text is going to go.\\nSo I'm going to click there,\\ndrag, and there's my area\\nwhere my text is going to go like that.\\nNow as soon as I click that second time,\\nspecifying that rectangle where the text is going to go,\\nyou'll see the ribbon changes,\\nand the cursor, and the cross hair disappear\\nto give me a flashing cursor\\nand a text area where the text is going to go.\\n\\nI'm now in the text editor contextual tab on the ribbon\\nfor multi-line text.\\nNow the good thing is\\nit's already got the text style in place,\\nbut I can still change it up here\\nin the style panel if I want to.\\nNow, one thing I am going to do now is type some text in.\\nSo this is going to be large conference room, like that.\\nSo there's my large conference room text,\\nI'm going to press enter\\nand it takes me to the next line of the multi-line text.\\n\\nSo I'll put something like CONF conference room 123,\\nsomething like that.\\nNow one of the nice things you can do is as you can see,\\nthe text area has kind of\\nautomatically dropped down the word room.\\nSee there's a little diamond shape there.\\nIf I click and drag that a little bit,\\njust drag it along, can you see?\\nIt just makes sure that the room is on the same line\\nas large conference.\\nJust looks neater.\\nHighlight the text like that\\nand then click on mask.\\n\\nThat will now add a background mask\\nto highlight the text in the drawing.\\nSo we tick use background mask.\\nNow the border offset is 1.5,\\nso it'll be 1.5 times the height of the text.\\nFill color, I'm going to go with cyan like that.\\nNow we could use the drawing background color.\\nThat's not going to help is it?\\nBecause it'll just be the same.\\nClick on okay,\\nand there we go, large conference room.\\nNow with that text still highlighted,\\nI can also make it bold, make it italic if I want to.\\n\\nAnd then I can close the text editor\\nby clicking on the green tick\\nor just click away from the text\\nand there's a nice text label in my drawing\\nhighlighting that room.\\nJust zoom in on the bottom chairs here of the table now\\nand pan up a little bit like that.\\nWe're staying on the text layer,\\nwe're using the same text style,\\nso we don't need to change any of that.\\nWe're going to go to the text fly out\\nand go to single line text.\\nNow, single line text asks for a start point of the text,\\nand each line of single line text is an individual object.\\n\\nWe're going to right click before we start placing anything\\nand we're going to go to justify on the shortcut menu.\\nNow this gives you all the justifications you need\\nfor your single line text.\\nSelect TC, top center,\\nand then the top center point of the text\\nis going to be the midpoint snap on the back\\nof the chair there, left click.\\nNow as you move away,\\nit'll ask for the rotation angle of the text.\\nZero is horizontal, remember,\\nzero to the right is horizontal to the east.\\n\\nSo press enter to accept the zero.\\nThere's our cursor\\nand we're just going to put large conference table,\\nall on line like that.\\nPress enter once.\\nIt'll prompt us for another line of single line text.\\nWe don't want any, so leave that blank.\\nPress enter again,\\nit closes out the single line text command.\\nNow we've got a bit of text\\nthat's kind of touching the objects,\\ndon't really want that.\\nSo if I now click on the text once\\nyou'll see the grips appear,\\nthere's our top center grip.\\n\\nJust click once on it, it'll go red,\\ndrag down a little bit,\\njust I'm going to come down there by say 200,\\ntype in 200, press enter,\\njust drops that label down a little bit.\\nHit escape a couple of times to deselect.\\nAnd if you zoom out now you can see how effective\\nthat is with your labels using multi-line text\\nand single line text in your drawing.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3997421\",\"duration\":599,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating effective dimension styles in

[Instructor] We're staying in our annotation.dwg file.\\nNow before we start anything else\\nand before we start thinking about dimension styles\\nfor our dimension annotation,\\nwe're going to make sure that we're on the right layer\\nfor the operation that we're performing.\\nSo we go to our layer dropdown.\\nNow you'll remember in the previous video\\nwe created our own text layer.\\nUse the slider bar and slide up towards the top.\\nThere's our DIM layer there.\\nRemember that red layer, A010 D DIM.\\n\\nWe're creating dimension annotation,\\nso we need to be on the DIMs layer.\\nNow before we place any dimensions on a drawing,\\nyou need an appropriate dimension style.\\nNow the workflow for this is similar to the textiles\\nthat we created for the text.\\nThere's just a lot more parameters within a dimension style,\\nso we're going to jump into those.\\nNow in order to do that,\\nwe'll stay in the home tab on the ribbon.\\nYou can go to the annotate tab on the ribbon\\nand you'll notice dimensions is there.\\n\\nThere's the dimensions panel.\\nI can click there on the arrow,\\nthat will open up the dimension style manager.\\nI'll close that for the moment.\\nGo back to the home tab on the annotation fly out here,\\npin it open.\\nAnd there's a dimension icon\\nwith a paintbrush, dimension style\\nthat also opens up the dimension style manager.\\nIt's up to you which methodology you use.\\nI tend to stay in the home tab and do it that way,\\nbut you can go into the annotate tab\\nand work from that route if you want to.\\nWhen the dimension style manager opens,\\nyou can see that you have a number\\nof dimension styles in the drawing already.\\n\\nYou'll notice there's one in there called LinkedIn Learning.\\nNow that is the current dimension style.\\nWe're going to create a new dimension style\\nand it's going to be a copy of LinkedIn Learning.\\nNo, we don't want to do that.\\nWe're going to call it Training_ANNO.\\nNow the ANNO is shorthand for annotative.\\nYou normally use annotative dimension styles now.\\nAnnotative scaling is pretty much the norm\\nin a lot of drawings now, and we'll talk about that\\nwhen we place our dimension annotation.\\n\\nNow we're going to start with LinkedIn Learning\\nbecause the good thing is there,\\nwe're using that as a template for our training_ANNO style.\\nIt needs to be annotative,\\nso make sure that the annotative box is ticked.\\nNow we are going to use it for all dimension types,\\nbut you can create sub styles\\nfor specific dimension types.\\nSo with training ANNO we might want a sub style\\nfor radius dimensions only.\\n\\nSo that would become training ANNO radius.\\nIt would be a sub style.\\nWe are going to use our particular overall style\\nfor all dimension types there.\\nClick on continue\\nand now you'll open up the dialogue box\\nthat says new dimension style\\nand there's the name of our style, training_ANNO.\\nNow there's a lot of tabs across the top.\\nSome of them we don't need to use.\\nGo to tolerances, make sure that that is set to none.\\nWe're not going to be using any tolerances\\nin this particular dimension style.\\n\\nAlternate units.\\nYou can display your alternate units\\nlike so by ticking the box\\nand then I might set that to architectural.\\nNow if you look really closely at that,\\nyou can see that you now have a metric dimension\\npiece of text at the front\\nand then there's some square brackets\\nshowing it in feet and inches as well.\\nWe are not going to display alternate units.\\nI'm going to untick that like so.\\nSo all we've got is our metric millimeter dimensions\\nin our metric millimeter drawing.\\n\\nSo that's alternate units and tolerances covered.\\nJump to the lines tab.\\nNow the reason I got you to go onto the DIM layer\\nis as we work through all of this\\nand all of the settings, the preview will display\\nthe settings of the dimensions on that layer.\\nSo dimension lines, these are the lines\\nbetween the arrow heads.\\nMake sure they're all set to by layer.\\nNow the good thing is a lot of this is preset\\nbecause the LinkedIn Learning dimension style\\nalready have by layer set up.\\n\\nBaseline spacing.\\nSet that to a value in millimeters that you want to use.\\nI'm going to use 12 millimeters, like so.\\nExtension lines.\\nAgain, all of this should be by layer\\nbecause then it's adopting the properties of the layer\\nwhen you place the dimensions.\\nExtend beyond dim lines,\\nthat's this little extension\\nof the extension line past the arrowhead.\\nI've gone for 2.5 millimeters.\\nOffset from origin is this little gap here.\\nSo when you place a dimension, you place an origin point\\noff of the geometry and then there's a gap.\\n\\nThat gap is four millimeters.\\nNow again, this is kind of Sean's default preset\\ndimension style that you can use.\\nYou may have different settings,\\nespecially if you're working with\\nimperial units for example.\\nThe settings would be very different.\\nWe don't need fixed length\\nextension lines there, by the way.\\nSo we're going to the symbols and arrows tab now.\\nClose filled arrow heads,\\nI'm going to use architectural ticks you'll notice.\\nNotice the second one defaults to what the first one is.\\n\\nI'm going to go back to close filled.\\nNow leaders we're going to use a dot\\nand that dot there applies to the quick leader command,\\nthe Q leader command.\\nWe'll touch on that later.\\nArrow size 3.50 millimeters\\nin relation to all of your texts there.\\nWe are not going to use any center marks.\\nWe'll leave that off.\\nYou can have marks or lines.\\nSo there's your marks there for the center of the circle.\\nOr you can have lines where the lines\\ngo through the center of the circle.\\nI'm going to leave set to none.\\n\\nDimension break is 3.75 millimeters.\\nArc length symbol.\\nYou can have an arc symbol\\nin front of an arc length dimension.\\nWe're going to put that above the dimension text,\\nso that's already preset anyway.\\nAny radius jog dimensions, we're going to have a jog angle\\nof 45 degrees.\\nAny jog height factors are 1.5 times text height\\nfor linear dimension jogs text.\\nNow this is where it gets clever.\\nDo you remember we set up a textile called DIMS model.\\nIf I go to that dropdown now, DIMS model is there\\nand the good thing is it's using the Calibri font already\\nand it's all preset.\\n\\nSo I can now utilize that\\nfor my dimension text in my dimension style.\\nText color.\\nYou can apply a fill if you want to to highlight like so.\\nDon't worry about it in this case,\\nbut it is useful on drawings\\nif you need to highlight dimensions.\\nText height, we've gone for 4.50 millimeters.\\nYou can put a frame around them like that,\\ndon't worry about that too much we can untick that.\\nNow you'll notice vertically\\nthe text placement is above the dimension line.\\n\\nHorizontally it's centered on the dimension line.\\nThe view is set left to right, not right to left.\\nRight to left kind of flips it and puts it upside down.\\nThat's for different views in different drawings.\\nJust leave it left to right.\\nThe offset from the dim line is 1.5 millimeters.\\nSo there's a little distance\\nbetween the text and the dimension line.\\nThere's three different text alignments.\\nYou can have everything horizontal, like that.\\nYou can have aligned with dimension line,\\nwhich tends to be the best\\nbecause it economizes on space with text\\nand dimensions or the ISO standard.\\n\\nYou'll notice any radii or diameters\\nhave that cranked horizontal line.\\nGo with aligned with dimension line.\\nWe're then going to go to fit.\\nAll of this can be left exactly as it is.\\nThe only sanity check you need to make\\nis that annotative is ticked.\\nEverything else should work itself out.\\nAgain though, if you start moving\\ninto all of these fit options and text placement,\\nmake sure that you go in and set it the way\\nthat you want it to work.\\nOtherwise, your dimensions could look a bit weird.\\n\\nPrimary units, we've gone for decimal.\\nWe're overriding the units precision in the drawing.\\nSo you'll notice that we're just going for\\nno decimal places.\\nIf I went for four decimal places,\\nit puts four decimal places.\\nIf I go for no decimal places,\\nit goes for no decimal places.\\nYou can see that here in the dimensions\\nthat have already been placed in the drawing.\\nNow, if you have a decimal separator,\\nit can be a period which in the UK is often known\\nas a decimal place.\\nWe can have a comma or a space.\\n\\nGo for period in this case.\\nYou can have prefixes, suffixes,\\nyou can change the scale factor.\\nYou can also round off to the nearest five, ten,\\none, two, millimeters or whatever.\\nSo you can set all of these settings\\nin the primary units tab.\\nTrailing zeros are always a good idea as well.\\nSo if I went to say four decimal places like that,\\ncan you see 60 there at the moment is just 60,\\nbut the trailing like that is on or off.\\n\\nIf I turn it off for angles, can you see two decimal places,\\ntwo decimal places, trailing zeros ticked,\\nit turns it off.\\nThat's the zero suppression.\\nIt's always a good idea to do that.\\nI'll set that back to no decimal places there as well.\\nSo now it's all just rounding up\\nto the nearest whole number.\\nWe talked about alternate units, we talked about tolerances.\\nWe're not using those.\\nSo back to the lines tab, everything is set.\\nWe click on OK.\\nSo there's our training ANNO dimension style.\\n\\nSo we select it like we did with the text style\\nand select set to current, and then we click on close.\\nWe are now ready to start thinking about placing\\nsome dimension annotation\\nusing our annotative dimension style.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2027425\",\"duration\":419,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Placing precise dimensions in your AutoCAD

These look a bit big don't they?\\nAnd clunky these bits of text on the dimensions there.\\n\\nThat's because they're set to that one to 100 annotation so\\nthat they display effectively one to 100 viewport.\\nStaying in the annotate tab on the ribbon there,\\nwe'll go to the dimensions\\nand click on the fly out here.\\nFor dimension types, select linear.\\nNow make sure your object snaps are on.\\nYou're going to select this midpoint here on the table left.\\nClick to this midpoint here on the table left click,\\nthere's our 4,000.\\n\\nJust drag upwards a little. Get it placed neatly like so.\\nClick again.\\nThat is a linear dimension\\nusing our dimension style that we created previously.\\nWe're going to do the same again.\\nWe're going to right click though and just repeat DIM linear.\\nWe're doing the same dimension type, so repeat DIM linear.\\nI'm going to go from this end point here.\\nLeft click to this end point here.\\nLeft click, drag it outwards\\nand take it to there and click again.\\n\\nNow because the dimension text is too big to fit\\nbetween the arrowheads.\\nUsing that fit tab in our dimension style,\\nremember I told you to leave it all alone\\nwhere you can alter it on the fly in the drawing,\\nclick on the text\\nor the dimension line, doesn't matter which,\\nand you'll see there's a grip on the dimension text\\nthe 1500.\\nHover over it and select move text only.\\nYou can now move that text.\\nLet's just pop it neatly there and click Can you see it?\\nUpdates the arrow heads and the text hit escape to deselect.\\n\\nVery useful if you need\\nto just manually tweak a dimension in any which way.\\nWe'll go up here to the dimension type dropdown\\nand select radius.\\nClick on this arc here and there's our seven 50 radius arc.\\nPlace it pointing down\\nand to the right there and click again.\\nSo two clicks, you select the arc or the circle,\\nthen place the radius like so.\\nNow it all looks a bit large at the moment, doesn't it?\\nThat's because we're using the one\\nto 100 annotation scale down there.\\n\\nEverything has been made 100 times bigger so\\nthat it displays neatly in the one to 100 viewport.\\nIf you now go to the ISO A one landscape tab\\nand zoom in now, make sure\\nthat your view port is not activated.\\nIf you double click inside the view port, it's activated.\\nCan you see that?\\nIt's a bit bold\\nand it says model here on the status bar.\\nDouble click outside the viewport.\\nYou'll see it's not bold\\nand it says paper on the status bar.\\n\\nSo just zoom in a bit\\nand you can see there,\\nthere's your dimensions displaying neatly\\nin the one to 100 viewport.\\nI'm now going to double click on the wheel to zoom extents.\\nMake sure that you double click on the wheel\\nto zoom extents fully out like that.\\nMake sure you can see that everything is where it should be.\\nYou want to make sure that you want to be able\\nto see the extent of that.\\nNow what you may find is if you double click on the wheel,\\nit will zoom to the extents\\nof the visible drawn objects on the sheet.\\nThat is the viewport.\\n\\nSo zoom out\\nand make sure you can see everything on the sheet like\\nthat in the layout tab.\\nGood CAD practice.\\nNow let's jump back to the model tab\\nand I'll leave it up to you to have a play around\\nwith some other dimension types.\\nPlace a few more dimensions if you wish,\\nusing that one to 100 annotation scale\\nand the dimension style that we've got set.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2029214\",\"duration\":281,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Adding simple leaders (QLEADER) to an AutoCAD drawing\",\"fileName\":\"4262256_en_US_03_05_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":303,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"GLOBAL MASKING NOTE: Remove/hide ALL references to \\\"Watt Beta\\\" on all screens, dialog boxes and palettes.

to place the leaders on the Dimension layer.\\nNow be very careful here.\\nThe Dim Layer Override doesn't work with QLEADER,\\nso you want to make sure\\nthat you go back to the Home tab on the

an old command in AutoCAD.\\nIt doesn't have an icon on the ribbon anymore,\\nso all you got to do is type QLEADER.\\n\\nSo it's Q-L-E-A-D-E-R.\\nSo when you type dynamic input,\\nit pops up the

[Instructor] We're starting another chapter now,\\nand we're going to take a look at\\ncommunicating our design intent.\\nNow, I have mentioned this a little bit\\nas we've worked through this Learning AutoCAD course,\\nand communicating your design intent\\nis incredibly important.\\nYou need to make sure that you communicate things\\nlike the sizes of your design, what your design actually is,\\nand to do that, you utilize your dimension annotation\\nand your text annotation,\\nand then you place it in scaled views in your layout tabs\\nso that people can look at and visualize your design\\nin the real world.\\n\\nSo you're communicating that design intent to say,\\n\\\"This is how I want it to look.\\nThis is how I want it to be built.\\nThis is how I want it to be manufactured,\\\" and so on.\\nNow in this particular chapter,\\nwe've got a new drawing for you.\\nIt's called Communication.dwg.\\nYou know the drill by now.\\nDownload it from the library\\nto follow along with the videos in this particular chapter.\\nNow, normally what you would do is develop a page setup\\nand a specific title block for your AutoCAD drawing\\nso that you can communicate design intent.\\n\\nNow, if you go and follow up this course\\nwith the AutoCAD 2026 Essential Training,\\nwe go into that in a lot more detail.\\nWe create title blocks, page setups, and so on.\\nWhat I'm going to show you here is a little bit of a cheat.\\nI'm going to show you how to create a cheat title block\\npurely for clarity, purely for speed,\\nso that you can get into\\nworking with AutoCAD in this course.\\nWe're going to go to the ISO A1 Landscape Layout tab.\\nNow you'll notice that the sheet there\\nhas already been set up.\\n\\nYou've got your viewport here,\\nwhich is set to a scale of one to a hundred.\\nSo there's our viewpoint there, like so.\\nNow we're going to create a very simple title block.\\nIt's not going to be rocket science,\\nbut it's just going to allow us\\nto work with the drawing quickly and easily.\\nAnd this is something you might do\\nif you just need to create a quick drawing for somebody\\nthat just has to get out of the door straight away.\\nIf you're starting to set up\\nyour CAD standards and things,\\nthat's when you start thinking about setting up\\nproper title blocks that relate to your CAD standards.\\n\\nThey also have their own page setups, and so on.\\nNow I'm going to go to the layer dropdown\\nand make sure that I'm on the title block layer,\\nbecause I'm creating a title block.\\nSo let's make sure that we're on the right layer,\\nhome tab on the ribbon into the draw panel,\\nand you're going to click on the flyout here\\nand select rectangle, like so.\\nNow the good thing is\\nI've got a viewport with a corner point.\\nIf I use that endpoint, snap there, left click, drag across,\\nthere's my rectangle.\\nJust place it so it looks sensible.\\n\\nClick again, like so.\\nSo there's my title block.\\nNow as long as that is inside those dashed lines there,\\nit will plot.\\nThose dashed lines are what they call your plotter extents,\\nand they're often set by drivers\\nfor what you're plotting to,\\nwhether it's a physical plotter,\\nwhether you're plotting to PDF, and so on.\\nAnd those extents, those boundaries are really important\\nbecause if you go outside that dash line, it won't plot.\\nIt'll be what they call truncated.\\nNow we've got a simple title block in place.\\n\\nAll I want to do here is now put something in here,\\na piece of text that lets somebody know what this is.\\nSo it's going to be our office floor plan, general arrangement.\\nSo I need to put some text in there to say that.\\nNow the good thing is, in this particular drawing,\\nif you go to the Annotation flyout,\\nyou'll notice we have\\na title layout 15 millimeter text style.\\nSo make sure you're using\\ntitle layout 15 millimeter text style,\\nand also we're placing text now.\\n\\nSo on the layer dropdown,\\nwe need to make sure that we're using the title text layer.\\nGet into the habit first time, every time,\\nlayer first, then do the job that you need to do.\\nI'm going to go to the Annotation panel,\\nclick on the text flyout, and go single line text.\\nI'm going to pop it under here like this.\\nJust click here.\\nNow hang on a minute, though.\\nWhat does that say there?\\nSpecify top center point of text.\\nIt's not quite the justification we need.\\nIt's remembered that\\nfrom previous drawings exercises we've worked on.\\n\\nSo right click and justify.\\nSanity check your justification of your text.\\nI'm going to select the default, the left there,\\ntop of the list, and I'm going to put a start point there.\\nLeft click.\\nThe rotation angle of the text is zero, as you can see.\\nJust press enter to accept that,\\nand there's our little cursor there flashing.\\nSo this is going to be Office Floor Plan\\nand make sure obviously you check your caps\\nand make sure that looks right, unlike me.\\nThere we go, and we'll put GENERAL ARRANGEMENT.\\n\\nYou can utilize capitals there just to make it stand out.\\nEnter once, enter twice.\\nThere's our piece of single line text.\\nNow you can click on the text, utilize the grip there,\\nclick and drag,\\nand we'll maybe pop that just under there like that,\\nOffice Floor Plan, GENERAL ARRANGEMENT,\\nor you might want it further down,\\nperhaps down here like that,\\nand then hit a scope to deselect the text.\\nWhat we're going to do now\\nis jump to our layer properties here,\\nand we're going to scroll down the list using the slider bar,\\nall the way down near the bottom,\\nand you'll see there's a viewports layer.\\n\\nSelect it,\\ndouble click on the little sheet of paper next to it\\nto make it the current layer,\\nbut note, on the little plotter there,\\ncan you see there's like a no entry symbol?\\nIt's letting you know that the viewports layer\\nwill not plot when you plot the drawing,\\nand that's deliberate.\\nYou don't want these rectangles\\nthat form your viewport's plotting.\\nYou only want the information on the drawing\\nto communicate your design intent.\\nSo with the viewports layer current now with the green tick,\\nclose the layout properties manager.\\n\\nYou'll notice because you're in a layout tab,\\nthere is a layout tab, if you'll pardon the pun,\\non the ribbon as well.\\nClick on the blue layout tab on the ribbon,\\nand what this does is it gives you all the information\\nabout the layout that you are working in.\\nSo notice you've got layout viewports.\\nClick on the flyout here, and select rectangular.\\nClick and drag as if you were drawing a rectangle, like so,\\nand you've got another viewport set up.\\nNow that viewport isn't set to scale or anything,\\nbut AutoCAD automatically fits\\nwhat's in the model tab into the viewport.\\n\\nYou can scale that viewport and zoom that viewport to suit\\nand set up

Let's type qleader.\\n(keyboard clacking)\\nAnd enter, first leader point,\\nI'll come off the chair again, midpoint there,\\ntake it up a little bit, click there,\\ndrag it horizontally, click there.\\nSpecify the text width, just press enter for zero,\\nand we'll type in there chair.\\n\\nEnter once, enter twice.\\nAs you can see, it now looks neat and tidy, albeit it's\\non the wrong layer\\n'cause we've got our view ports layer current.\\nSo all we've got to do there is select the leader,\\nselect the text, go to our layer drop down there,\\nand we'll put it on the text layer like so.\\nThere we go. Hit escape to deselect.\\nNow, if you want to do the insert, you do it\\nin exactly the same way,\\nbut let's make sure that we're on the text layer this time.\\nSo text is now the current drafting layer.\\nI can right click recent input and go to QLEADER there.\\n\\nAnd then, I'll pick a point there, drag that out there,\\nclick, do a little horizontal using the polar tracking.\\nAnd then, the text width, I'll accept the zero\\nby pressing enter again and type insert like so.\\nEnter once, enter twice.\\nAnd there's our insert QLEADER as well.\\nNow, everything now is using\\nthe appropriate annotation scale.\\nIt's all at one to 40.\\nYou can check that as well.\\nIf you hover now, can you see it's only got\\nthe one annotative symbol on the crosshair?\\nSo it's indicating it's only got\\none annotation scale applied.\\n\\nNow, you'll notice here\\nthat this dimension has two because it has.\\nIt's working in two different view ports.\\nOkay, now that we've done that, what happens if we go\\nto the ISO A1 landscape?\\nYou'll notice now, can you see\\nthat the dimensions are not\\nin the one to 100 viewport anymore?\\nBut they are in the one to 40 viewport.\\nSo that's how you utilize annotative scaling.\\nYou set an annotation scale for objects that you want\\nto display in the viewport scale that you're using.\\n\\nSo we want our dimensions to display\\nin the one to 40 viewport,\\nso we give them a one to 40 annotation scale.\\nAnd we want our dimensions going around the building.\\nIf we go back to the model tab\\nand zoom out a bit, these dimensions here, we want to appear\\nin the one to 100 viewport.\\nAnd that's how you work with your annotation scaling\\nto communicate your design intent on your drawings.\\nAnd it works really well\\nbecause when you go back\\nto that ISO A1 landscape layout tab, you've got information\\nin each viewport that communicates your design intent.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4000277\",\"duration\":359,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Defining your page setup in your AutoCAD drawing\",\"fileName\":\"4262256_en_US_04_04_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":368,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"GLOBAL MASKING NOTE: Remove/hide ALL references to \\\"Watt Beta\\\" on all screens, dialog boxes and palettes.

ISO A1 landscape layout tab\\nand I'm going to go to page setup manager.\\n\\nNow you'll notice\\nthat the layout names have asterisks around them.\\nSo we've got the ISO A1 landscape layout tab there\\nand the layout two there.\\nThere's already an existing page setup\\ncalled ISO A1 landscape PDF hi res\\nwhich is currently being used\\nby the ISO A1 landscape layout tab.\\nNow we're going to click on new\\nand what we're going to do,\\nwe're going to use the ISO A1 landscape PDF high res.\\n\\nI'm going to utilize that there and click on okay,\\nbut before I do that, it needs a name.\\nSo we're just going to call it ISO A1-landscape.\\nLet's make sure we get that right so it looks good.\\nAnd then just a dash and then PDF.\\nSo it's a similar name, but it hasn't got the high res bit.\\nSo I'm going to okay that like so.\\nNow it's letting me know\\nthat the plotter configuration cannot be used\\nfor one of these reasons.\\n\\nThe driver has a problem.\\nSo what it's done is it's set the plotting device\\nto none in the page setup.\\nSo if I okay that, can you see it says none.\\nSo I'm going to go down here and I want it to be a PDF.\\nI want it to go out to a high quality PDF.\\nNow the paper size, it changes it accordingly.\\nSo I need to jump in here.\\nI need an ISO A1.\\nThere's ISO A1 841 by 594 there like so.\\nNow what I'm going to do is I'm going to go\\nto the extents there and center the plot.\\n\\nSo make sure it's centered.\\nAnd then what I need to do is I need\\nto just click on preview.\\nNow it does look a bit weird.\\nI'm not going to worry about that too much.\\nI'm going to right click and exit the preview.\\nAnd what I'm going to do is I'm just going to okay that.\\nBut before I okay it, make sure that your scale is set\\nto one to one because you want an A1 title block\\nto sit on an A1 sheet, the paper size there.\\nSo that should be one-to-one.\\nMake sure you are using a plot star table.\\n\\nI'm just using monochrome CTB black and white,\\nwhich is one of the default AutoCAD ones.\\nAnd sanity check.\\nMake sure that your drawing orientation is landscape.\\nSo I'm just going to click on okay for that.\\nAnd there it is there in the list.\\nNow if I select my new page setup\\nand just double click, it will apply that to the layout tab.\\nSo this is why the preview looked a bit off.\\nCan you see now that our temporary title block\\nis outside those dash lines that I mentioned previously?\\nClose the page setup manager for a moment.\\n\\nWe need to do a bit of manual adjustment.\\nSo we're going to click on the view port first\\nand we're going to right click.\\nAnd on the shortcut menu, select move, go over here\\nto the top corner.\\nCan you see that?\\nThere's an endpoint snap there.\\nClick and bring that view port in\\nso it's inside those dash lines like that.\\nThen we know that's definitely going to plot.\\nThe other thing we need to move is our text.\\nWe'll click on our text, click on our grip,\\njust move the text inside like that\\nfor the moment and hit escape.\\n\\nThen what we need to do is redo our rectangle.\\nIt's not in the right place, is it?\\nSo that's on the title block layer.\\nSo my suggestion here is make the layer title block current.\\nGo to the rectangle command on the draw panel\\non the home tab on the ribbon, and draw a new rectangle.\\nAnd what I would do, just come inside the dash lines,\\nclick drag, make sure you're inside the dash lines\\non this corner,\\nand click again, then select this rectangle\\nand just right click and erase it.\\n\\nWe've now put a temporary title block\\ninside the page setup settings.\\nSo that should now work nice and neatly.\\nJust place that text a bit more sensibly, select it,\\nclick on the grip, pop it back down here in the corner,\\nhit escape to deselect.\\nNow that's using your new page setup that you created now.\\nSo that's great.\\nSo if I now right click here on the layout tab\\nand go to page setup manager,\\nwe're using the ISO A1 landscape PDF.\\nThere it is there.\\nThe old one,\\nthe high res one can now be right clicked on and deleted.\\n\\nSo we don't need that anymore.\\nWe've got a new page setup.\\nSo I'm going to click on close.\\nBut before we do anything else,\\nwe need to make sure that this is all working.\\nSo we jump to the output tab on the ribbon\\nand we go to preview on the plot panel there.\\nThere you go.\\nIt now looks nice and neat and tidy.\\nThe only thing that is a problem\\nis because we're using the monochrome color table,\\nour background masking\\nof our text there is just a black block.\\nSo what we can do is right click and exit.\\n\\nAnd what we'll do, we'll jump into the model tab\\nand there's our masking there.\\nSo I can just double click on this text here.\\nIt opens up the text editor.\\nWe'll highlight the text\\nand we'll switch that mask off like that.\\nUntick the box.\\nOkay, and that's now gone.\\nClose the text editor, job done.\\nIf I go back to preview now,\\nlet's jump into the ISO A1 landscape first and then preview.\\nAs you can see, large conference room,\\nlarge conference room, it's all working,\\nright click and exit.\\n\\nYou've now setup your page setup\\nso that you can now communicate that design\\nvia PDF

it's one of those exercise files\\nthat you can download from the library\\nto follow along with this particular video.\\nNow, the reason I've got an AutoCAD drawing open is purely\\njust to give you a quick breakdown of the AutoCAD interface.\\n\\nNow, the AutoCAD interface is very, very consistent,\\nit has been for the last few versions of AutoCAD,\\nso it should look the same as the interface\\nthat you are using\\nwhen you are working through this particular course.\\nNow, I'm just going to give you a quick heads up\\nof where everything is.\\nTop left of the screen,\\nyou can see the red A.\\nNow that will open up the AutoCAD application menu.\\nJust along here you can see some icons.\\nThis is known as the Quick Access Toolbar.\\n\\nGoing across to the right here,\\nthis is known as the info bar where you can type a keyword\\nor phrase to get into the AutoCAD help.\\nThat's where you're signed in there\\nto your Autodesk account.\\nYou can see the little blue symbol,\\nand the Autodesk account tool tip popped up there as well.\\nYou can also go to the Autodesk App store.\\nYou can also stay connected\\nwith the Autodesk online community.\\nSo if you look there, you can go\\nto things like the AutoCAD blog,\\nthe YouTube channel, and so on.\\nYou'll notice as well, we've got the help screens here,\\nso there's all the help and so on there, like so.\\n\\nAnd if we go right across to the end,\\nyou'll also notice here as well,\\nwe have the Autodesk Assistant.\\nThe Autodesk Assistant is an AI-powered assistant.\\nIf you click on it, you can ask the AI assistant questions\\nabout AutoCAD.\\nYou can get support queries generated,\\nand so on, and so forth.\\nSo that's the top part of the AutoCAD screen.\\nYou'll also notice in the middle, at the top,\\nyou can see the name of the file that you're working on,\\nwhich is Introduction.dwg.\\n\\nAutoCAD runs with a ribbon interface.\\nNow, the ribbon interface has different tabs.\\nAs you can see, there's the different tabs\\nas I click along them, giving you access\\nto the ribbon panels\\nand all the different icons on the ribbon panels.\\nI'll jump back to the Home tab,\\nand you'll notice as well, some of the panels have arrows.\\nYou can expand them like so,\\nand pin them open.\\nWhen that's pinned open,\\nit stays open.\\nWhen it's unpinned, if you move away from it,\\nit goes back into the ribbon at the top of the screen.\\n\\nJust underneath the ribbon there,\\nyou'll notice you've got tabs.\\nThere's the Start tab, there's the introduction,\\nthere's our file there.\\nThat is our Introduction.DWG file.\\nIf we had other drawings open in this session of AutoCAD,\\nthere would be other file tabs across the top of the screen.\\nThe little plus sign there lets you open up\\na new blank drawing with a default template.\\nYou can see the drawing here.\\nWe can zoom in and zoom out using the mouse,\\nand I'll take you into how all of that technology works.\\nNotice I'm panning there and zooming, and so on.\\n\\nI can double-click on the wheel there on the mouse,\\nand that will zoom to extent.\\nDown towards the bottom of the screen now,\\nyou can see we've got the tabs.\\nThere's the Model tab,\\nand these ones here are known as the layout tabs.\\nYou can see they preview each time when you hover over them.\\nThere's the command line here.\\nThis is the old fashioned way of running AutoCAD.\\nYou can type commands like we used to in the old days,\\nso if you click in the command line there,\\nyou can type a command.\\nLast but not

interface a bit more deeply\\nso you understand where things are,\\nso that when we start working on the exercises\\nfurther along in the course,\\nyou know where to locate specific functions within AutoCAD.\\nIn this particular video,\\nwe're going to take a deeper dive\\ninto the quick access toolbar.\\n\\nNow that's top left up near the application menu,\\nso it's these icons up here.\\nSo you can see we've got new,\\nwe've got open, we've got save.\\nWe've also got save as\\nwhere we can save a copy of the current drawing\\nunder a new file name.\\nWe can open up files from the AutoCAD web\\nand mobile folders,\\nand we can also save files to the web and mobile folders.\\nThat's a cloud based area based on your Autodesk account\\nwhere you can save DWG files.\\n\\nSo the AutoCAD web and mobile folders are exactly\\nwhat it says on the tin.\\nThey are web and mobile folders based in the cloud\\nwhere you can utilize the AutoCAD web application\\nand the AutoCAD mobile application.\\nYou'll notice there we've got an icon there that allows us\\nto plot straight away based on our plot settings,\\nand we've also got undo.\\nYou'll notice there you can see I can undo commands\\nand go back to a group of commands.\\nAnd it's the same with the redo,\\nbut I haven't done anything yet with the redo,\\nso there's nothing to redo right now.\\n\\nNow you'll notice we've also got share.\\nWe can share our drawing\\nfrom the Quick Access toolbar as well.\\nBut it's this little icon here that's really clever.\\nSo if I click on that,\\nit looks a bit like an eject symbol from an old CD player.\\nIf I click on it, I can customize the quick access toolbar.\\nSo what I can do here is I can add other commands\\nthat I use all the time to the Quick Access toolbar,\\nhence the name Quick Access.\\nSo if I go down here\\nand I perhaps add something like say the layer command,\\nwhat that does now is it adds the layer drop down here\\nso I can see all the layers in my AutoCAD drawing\\nand change the setting of those layers.\\n\\nNow, we can also do that over here in the layers panel,\\nin the home tab on the ribbon.\\nYou'll notice that dropdown is the same right there.\\nBut it saves me having to worry about that.\\nI might go into the insert tab.\\nI don't have access to that layer dropdown\\non the layers panel now,\\nbut I have it on the quick access toolbar instead like so.\\nSo I'll just hit escape there a couple of times now,\\njust to finish off that particular dropdown.\\nIf you hit escape a couple of times,\\nthe dropdown will disappear.\\nI'll go back to the home tab on the ribbon.\\n\\nNow, one of the things you might want to do is leave\\nthat layer setting switched on.\\nThere's the little eject type symbol again.\\nLayer is now ticked, you'll notice.\\nSo if I click on it again, it unticks it,\\nand you'll notice the layers disappear.\\nClick on the little symbol again, click on layer.\\nWe've got layers back on the quick access toolbar.\\nIt's that quick and it's that easy.\\nNow, there are some other settings there as well.\\nIf I click there like so,\\nI can potentially show it below the ribbon\\ninstead of above the ribbon.\\n\\nSo if I click there,\\nnotice the quick access toolbar's now here below the ribbon.\\nClick on that again, show it above the ribbon.\\nI can go like so.\\nNow there are some other settings that I can use there.\\nI can show the old fashioned menu bar.\\nShow menu bar.\\nCan you see there?\\nWe've got all the old dropdowns at the top now.\\nCan you

can see it disappears again.\\n\\nSo there's lots of different ways of getting quick access\\nto your AutoCAD commands using the quick access toolbar.\\nOne of the little challenges there for you is to go\\nand set that layer setting in the quick access toolbar\\nso that you've got the layer dropdown,\\nand then just leave it there in the quick access toolbar\\nand use that later on as you work through the videos\\nand the exercises in this

[Instructor] Once again, we're staying\\nin the interface.dwg file.\\nNow, what we're going to look at now in a bit more depth\\nis the AutoCAD ribbon and the AutoCAD ribbon panels.\\nWhat I'd like you to do\\nis make sure you're in the Home tab on the ribbon.\\nSee we've got all the different tabs.\\nJump to each tab,\\nyou can see it has lots of different functionality\\nwithin AutoCAD itself.\\nLet's just go to the Home tab where it's got all\\nwhat I call the base-level workflows and processes,\\nsuch as Draw, Modify, Annotation, Layers, et cetera.\\n\\nNow, what we're going to take a look at\\nis the ribbon and the ribbon panels.\\nNow, you may click accidentally on this icon up here.\\nCan you see the little sort of arrow there?\\nThere's a little dropdown arrow next to it.\\nNow, be very careful with this, because if you click on it,\\nyou'll find that your ribbon changes format.\\nAnd if you click on it again, changes format again.\\nIf you click on it again, it disappears entirely, almost.\\nIf you click on it again though,\\nyou'll find that fourth click brings you back\\nto the default ribbon.\\n\\nIt's just different ribbon appearances, really.\\nSo if you click on it, different appearance there.\\nIf I hover over Draw, there's the draw commands,\\nAnnotation, Layers, and so on.\\nSo you just keep clicking\\non that little white sort of rectangular icon there,\\nand you'll get back to the original ribbon layout.\\nNow, the ribbon panels themselves form\\na specific function within AutoCAD.\\nSo for example, the Draw panel has all the draw tools on it.\\n\\nNow, you'll notice there are commands with flyout arrows.\\nSo see the Circle command there?\\nClick on the flyout,\\nthere's all the different types of circle.\\nNow, that's the same across the board\\nwith all of the different commands.\\nSo for example, if I went to Array,\\nthere's the different array commands available\\nin the Modify panel.\\nSo you can do that very quickly and easily using each\\nof the ribbon panels.\\nNow, the ribbon panels,\\nif they've got an arrow on their title bar, such as Draw,\\nclick there, click on the pin,\\nall of the commands are now available on the Draw panel,\\nand they will stay pinned open.\\n\\nClick on the pin again,\\nthe expanded Draw panel goes back into the ribbon.\\nSo there's some really useful features there\\nto allow you to work quickly and easily\\nwhen you're working with your AutoCAD commands.\\nNow, one more little clever feature\\nthat you've got with AutoCAD\\nis a thing called sticky panels.\\nNow, these don't often get covered\\nin AutoCAD training courses.\\nSo let's click and hold on the Draw title bar there.\\nClick and hold, and then drag the panel out of the ribbon,\\nand release the mouse button.\\n\\nNow, what you've done there\\nis you've placed that sticky panel in the drawing area\\nas if it was like a Post-it note,\\nso it's now sitting there in that particular space.\\nLet's do the same with the Modify panel.\\nClick and hold on the Modify panel title bar,\\nclick and drag, release the mouse button,\\nand we've now got two sticky panels in the drawing area.\\nBut the benefit you've got now\\nis you've now got your Draw and Modify tools available\\nin the drawing area if you go to, say, the Annotate tab.\\nSo you could be annotating,\\ndoing Text, Dimensions, Centerlines, Leaders,\\nbut you've still got access to your drawing tools.\\n\\nNow, here's the clever bit though,\\nAutoCAD remembers where these sticky panels came from.\\nSo even though I'm in the Annotate tab on the ribbon,\\nif I hover over the sticky panels,\\ncan you see some little sort of bar menus pop up?\\nIf I hover here, there's one that looks like a T,\\n\\\"Return Panels to Ribbon.\\\"\\nClick on it, it returns it to the ribbon.\\nDo the same with the Modify panel.\\nClick on the little T-shaped icon,\\nreturns the panels back to the ribbon.\\nNow, you would've thought they would've gone\\ninto the Annotate tab on the ribbon.\\nIf I go back to the Home tab though,\\nthere's Draw, there's Modify,\\nback where they should be on the ribbon.\\n\\nSo make sure that you check out the AutoCAD ribbon.\\nIt's really important that you get used to it\\nand you see how it works.\\nNow, one more thing just before we leave the ribbon.\\nYou'll notice here that you get these little arrows as well,\\nthese little sort of 45 degree arrows.\\nClick on that, and you'll see that that opens up,\\nin this case, the Properties palette,\\nthere's the Properties palette.\\nI can click on the cross there to close that.\\nIf I go to say something like the Annotate tab\\nand click on this particular arrow here,\\nthat'll open up the Text Style manager within AutoCAD.\\n\\nSo investigate all of these tools\\nand check out how the ribbon functions\\nwithin your AutoCAD interface.\\nIt's fundamental to how you work,\\nso make sure that you are familiar with the ribbon,\\nthe ribbon panels,\\nand how they function within the AutoCAD interface itself.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4001144\",\"duration\":220,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Customizing the AutoCAD interface using

[Instructor] Once again,\\nwe're staying in our AutoCAD drawing, Interface.dwg,\\nand we're diving deeper into the AutoCAD interface\\nas we work through this chapter.\\nIn this particular video,\\nwe're going to check out how we work with dialogue boxes\\nand palettes in AutoCAD.\\nNow, this is how AutoCAD functions on a generic level.\\nYou use dialog boxes to input information,\\nyou use palettes to utilize information and data\\nin your AutoCAD drawings as well.\\n\\nNow, there is a subtle difference between the two,\\nand I want to make sure that you're aware of how they work.\\nNow, I want you to stay in the Home tab\\non the ribbon for the moment.\\nAnd we're going to go to the annotation panel here\\nand click on the flyout here.\\nNow, this is all of our annotation styles here.\\nSo you can see these icons here,\\nwe've got text styles, dimension styles, leader styles,\\nand table styles.\\nI'd like you to click on the A with the paintbrush.\\n\\nThat will open up the Text Style dialogue box.\\nNow, you know it's a dialogue box.\\nAnd how do you know it's a dialogue box?\\nBecause it says Text Style at the top horizontally.\\nSo anything that's got a horizontal title bar\\ntends to be a dialogue box.\\nAnd you'll notice a dialogue box also has the buttons,\\nthe little tick boxes.\\nSo, if I want this to be annotative, I tick that box.\\nCan you see that little tick box\\nor check box as you may call it?\\nAnd then I uncheck it\\nto switch off the annotative function there.\\n\\nThat is a dialogue box.\\nNow, dialogue boxes in AutoCAD can be resized.\\nHover over the edge, you get the double arrow,\\nclick and drag.\\nI can make that bigger or smaller.\\nNotice it goes to a default minimum size.\\nSame if I do it this way, drag it up and down.\\nCan you see there's a default minimum size?\\nSo that's how you work with a dialog box.\\nAnd you'll often find that there's an Apply button,\\nCancel button, and there's always a Help button,\\nso that you can get context sensitive help on text styles.\\n\\nNow, I'm not going to change any settings in there.\\nI can click on the cross there, like so, to close it,\\nor I can click on Cancel.\\nEither one of those will close the dialogue box.\\nNow, a palette is very different.\\nIt's a bit more intuitive.\\nSo, if we stay on the Home tab on the ribbon\\nand go to the Layers panel here\\nand click on the Layer Properties icon.\\nNow, this will open up the Layer Properties Manager palette.\\nSee, the title bar is vertical.\\nThere's Layer Properties Manager just there.\\n\\nIf I click and drag on the title bar,\\nI can drag that around,\\njust like I can a dialogue box, you'll notice.\\nI can make it bigger and smaller.\\nAgain, just like a dialog box, hover over the edge,\\nget the double arrows, drag.\\nI can make it longer.\\nHover here, get the double arrows.\\nAgain, it it's a little bit of a fiddle sometimes\\nif you've got a sensitive mouse, like I have.\\nBut you can see there, there's all my layers.\\nAnd then I can hover, get the double arrows.\\nI can make the columns bigger and smaller,\\nand so on and so forth.\\nSo that's how I can set it all up.\\n\\nBut there is some functionality\\navailable with your palettes,\\nand they are these icons here.\\nSo, I've got Properties.\\nIf I click on Properties,\\nI can move it, size it, close it,\\nI can allow docking, yes or no.\\nSo it's ticks at the moment.\\nSo I can dock this palette if I want to.\\nI can anchor it left or I can anchor it right.\\nI can also set a thing called Auto-hide or Transparency.\\nNow, all of those settings,\\nI'm going to leave as default right now.\\n\\nAnd what I'm going to do now\\nis I'm going to click and drag\\nthe Layer Properties Manager to the left.\\nCan you see I get kind of a ghost image?\\nWhen I release the mouse button,\\nit's now docked on the left-hand side.\\nIf I click and drag there on the edge,\\nI can make it bigger and smaller, and so on.\\nNow, what I can also do there,\\nso that it's not taking up so much space,\\nis I can switch on what is called Auto-hide.\\nSee that little icon there?\\nClick there.\\nWhen I hover over it, you'll notice it comes out.\\n\\nWhen I move away, it disappears.\\nThat's what Auto-hide does.\\nNow, you also see there's a little grainy\\nbunch of dots there.\\nYou can just see them when I hover over it.\\nAnd what that means is I can hover over it\\nand I can undock it.\\nBut before I do that, let's go back to the Auto-hide\\nand switch it back on\\nso that it's visible all the time rather than auto-hiding.\\nAnd then, can you see,\\nI can click here on this little set of dots, click and drag,\\nand I can then undock it as well, you'll notice.\\nThere you go.\\n\\nIt's undocked now, you'll see.\\nSo, that's the Layer Properties Manager.\\nThat's how quick and easy it is to use.\\nNow, we'll go into layers and things\\nin a little bit more detail later on\\nand look at the settings for layers\\nin the Layer Properties Manager.\\nBut that's purely how you work with a dialogue box\\nand a palette\\nwhen you are working with your AutoCAD interface.\\nNow, there's lots of different dialogue boxes and palettes.\\nSo again, go and check them out, see how they work,\\nsee how you can dock them, move them around, and so on,\\non your AutoCAD screen.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4001142\",\"duration\":247,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Working with the AutoCAD command

check out the command line.\\nNow the command line is normally by default located\\nat the bottom of the screen.\\nYou can see it here, it says, \\\"Type a command.\\\"\\nSo if I click in there and type line,\\nyou'll notice that a suggestion menu appears,\\nand it's locating all of the commands\\nthat have the word line in them.\\n\\nNow obviously the most common one is the LINE command,\\nso I

move around,\\nit's looking for me to snap to a point\\nto start drawing a line.\\nSo if I click in space here, drag the mouse, click again,\\npress Enter to finish, I've drawn a line.\\nSo that's basically\\nhow I instigate a command using the command line.\\n\\nNow the lovely thing about the command line is\\nif I click on this arrow here at the end,\\nit'll show me the last command that I

little arrow again,\\nthat minimizes it back to the command line.\\nIt's a great way of going back\\nand checking what you may or may not have done\\nin an AutoCAD drawing.\\nNow one of the things you can do\\nwith the command line is you can move it around.\\n\\nSee these little dots here?\\nClick and drag on the dots,\\nand you can move the command line around.\\nNow I don't tend to like doing that.\\nI like to leave it just parked in the middle at the bottom,\\nso I could go up to undo up here,\\nand you might think that that would undo that.\\nIt doesn't, okay?\\nSo you do need to click

in there and I can change any number\\nof settings in AutoCAD if I want to.\\n\\nSo you can see there,\\nthe command line is just a method of input.\\nNow the one thing I will say is a lot of the time,\\nyou won't use the command line for input.\\nYou'll use the ribbon,\\nyou'll use the prompts next\\nto the crosshair known as the dynamic input,\\nand you'll very rarely use the command

[Instructor] Like in previous videos in this chapter,\\nwe're staying in the interface.dwg file.\\nWe're going to take a deeper dive\\ninto dynamic input in AutoCAD.\\nIt's known as Dynmode, D-Y-N-M-O-D-E,\\nand it's on by default in later versions of AutoCAD.\\nHow do you know if dynamic input\\nis on by default in AutoCAD?\\nIt's very simple.\\nIf you run a command\\nand the prompts appear near the cursor, the crosshair,\\nyou know that dynamic input is switched on.\\n\\nSo if I go up here to the Draw panel on the Home tab,\\nand click on the Line command,\\ncome into the drawing area, can you see\\nit's prompting me to specify the first point,\\nsaying, see, it's next to the crosshair.\\nThat means that dynamic input,\\nor Dynmode, is on.\\nNotice as well though,\\nthe line command has appeared on the command line\\nat the bottom of the screen.\\nSo you can see you've got the specify first point prompt\\nfor the line command, both on the crosshair\\nand on the command line.\\n\\nIt's always worth checking the difference between the two,\\nbecause sometimes the command line\\nmight give you more information\\nthan the dynamic input on the crosshair might.\\nSo just check that out.\\nIt's always worth that quick sanity check.\\nBut you can see there, if I move around now,\\nclick once in that space there,\\ndrag the mouse a little bit, click again,\\npress Enter on the keyboard,\\nI've drawn a line.\\nSo you can see there\\nthat I've drawn a line and the dynamic input\\nhas prompted me to do that.\\nNow, if you go down to the status bar, bottom right,\\nyou'll see there's three little lines\\nright in the bottom-right corner.\\n\\nIf you hover over that, it'll say Customization.\\nClick on it, and a big long menu appears.\\nNow, you'll notice that there's various options\\nticked on that menu.\\nThose are various drafting settings\\nthat are set up in AutoCAD,\\nsome are displayed on the status bar bottom right.\\nIf you go near the top, the top quarter,\\nthere's dynamic input, or Dynmode.\\nYou'll notice it is not ticked.\\nIt's on, but it's not ticked.\\n\\nClick on it and a little tick will appear.\\nCome down to the three little lines again,\\nthe customization.\\nClick on that again to close that menu.\\nSo now, you've switched on dynamic input on the status bar.\\nIt's this icon here with the little plus sign on it.\\nThat little plus sign indicates the cursor,\\nand dynamic input is on at the moment.\\nHence, the icon is blue.\\nThere's the variable name, Dynmode,\\nthe system variable Dynmode,\\nand it's letting you know that dynamic input is on.\\n\\nIf I right click over that icon,\\nI get dynamic input settings.\\nClick on that,\\nand that will open up the Drafting Settings dialogue box.\\nNotice we are in the Dynamic Input tab.\\nI can change my dynamic input settings\\nin there if I want to.\\nNow, I can safely say,\\nsince dynamic input became available in AutoCAD,\\nI have never ever changed these settings.\\nI've never felt the need to.\\nHowever, if you feel that you want\\nto investigate them, please do.\\n\\nI'm not going to, I'm just going to click on Cancel, like so.\\nBut, basically, I can switch dynamic input on or off.\\nSo if I click on it now,\\ncan you see it's gone gray and it's off.\\nSo if I now go to the line command again,\\nnotice there's nothing on the crosshair,\\nthe prompt is now on the command line.\\nSo if I click once, drag the mouse, click again,\\npress Enter,\\nall of that functionality is now on the command line.\\nIf I switch dynamic input on again,\\ndown here on the status bar, make it blue again,\\nand then go to the line command again,\\ncan you see now, it's coming up on the cursor.\\n\\nThat's what dynamic input's all about.\\nIt puts the prompt on the cursor.\\nSo, it's a bit like watching a foreign movie.\\nYou spend more time reading the subtitles down\\non the command line than you do looking\\nat the cross hair when you're designing on the screen.\\nSo that's why Autodesk have put the dynamic input\\non the cross hair.\\nSo there's another line there.\\nPress Enter to finish.\\nNow what you can do there is you can select each\\nof these lines by just putting the cross hair over them.\\nSee the little square on the crosshair?\\nJust make sure that that's there like so over each line.\\nAnd they go a blue color\\nwith the little blue grips displayed.\\n\\nYou can now get rid of all of those by right-clicking\\nand selecting Arrays on the shortcut menu.\\nThere we go, they're gone now.\\nSo your

[Instructor] We're starting a new chapter now,\\nand we're going to be taking a look at\\nhow you work with your units in your AutoCAD drawings,\\nand also how you work with your options\\nand how you set them up in AutoCAD.\\nSo for this particular chapter,\\nwe've got a new drawing for you.\\nIt's called Units&Options.dwg.\\nAnd you can download it from the library to follow along\\nwith a few of the videos in this particular chapter.\\nWhen you open the drawing, you should be in the Model tab.\\n\\nYou can see that there, bottom left in AutoCAD,\\nthere's the Model tab down there.\\nAnd you should be looking at a floor plan,\\nwhere you can see the grid lines, the dimensions,\\nthe desks, the chairs, et cetera.\\nNow this particular drawing at the moment\\nis set to metric units.\\nNow I work in metric because I'm based in the UK,\\nand we use metric units all the time.\\nThings like millimeters, meters and so on.\\nWe will also discuss imperial units in this chapter as well.\\n\\nSo what we're going to take a look at\\nis how we switch on units, set our units,\\nand also display our units in our AutoCAD drawings.\\nNow the quickest way to set your AutoCAD units\\nis simply to type the word units.\\nSo if you type it, you'll notice there,\\nunits appears next to the crosshair,\\nbecause I've got my Dynamic Input switched on.\\nSo the suggestion menu pops up, it says,\\n\\\"Oh look, you're typing units.\\\"\\nSo what it does there is it finds every single command\\nthat has the word units in it.\\n\\nYou just need that one that says units.\\nSo you just type units, and press Enter.\\nAnd what'll happen is the drawing units\\ndialogue box will appear.\\nNow there's a lot of information in the dialogue box.\\nYou only need those two top panes really,\\nfor what we are doing in this particular drawing.\\nSo you'll notice, we have length and we have angle.\\nLet's look at length here.\\nNow there are five different settings for length.\\nYou've got architectural, decimal, engineering,\\nfractional, and scientific.\\n\\nAll of these display in different ways.\\nSo for example, if I went to architectural,\\nthere's a little preview there.\\nYou can see it's obviously an imperial display.\\nAnd you can see there that it's feet and inches.\\nIf I come down to decimal though, it's a metric display,\\nwith a precision there with a decimal place.\\nNow there's nothing to say\\nthat you're not measuring your inches,\\nyour feet in a decimal methodology.\\nYou might be doing 1.5 feet or 1.5 inches.\\n\\nBut a lot of the time, if you're working in imperial,\\nyou'll go for something like architectural,\\nengineering, or fractional.\\nSo fractional, can you see,\\nthere's feet and quarter of an inch.\\nNow I'm going to go with decimal, purely for clarity, like so.\\nAnd you've got different levels of precision.\\nYou can actually go to eight decimal places\\nafter the decimal point, you'll notice there.\\nCan you see that?\\nSo you can get really accurate with AutoCAD.\\nAutoCAD in the background, with your computer's processor,\\ncan actually work to 20 decimal places.\\n\\nSo it can be pretty accurate if it needs to be.\\nLet's just go with one decimal place for length.\\nNow over here, angles again,\\nwe've got different methodologies.\\nWe've got decimal degrees, degrees, minutes and seconds.\\nWe've got gradients and radiance and surveyors units.\\nSurveyors units, points of the compass,\\nas you can see with degrees, minutes and seconds.\\nAnd you've got things like radiance.\\nSo you've got precision to an R.\\nNow gradients and radiance\\nare all to do with pie and circles.\\nLet's just keep it simple.\\nWe'll go with decimal degrees, like so.\\n\\nNow, decimal degrees, again,\\nyou've got those eight decimal places there.\\nNow be aware, angles are important.\\nThat 0.12 of an angle,\\nas you make that angle bigger and wider,\\ndoes become, in essence, a slice of pie\\nthat gets bigger and bigger\\ncoming out from the center of a circle.\\nSo you might want to double up there on your precision.\\nSo you might go to two decimal places.\\nSo if I was using for length, two decimal places there,\\ndouble it up your angles to four.\\n\\nAnd the reason I say that\\nis it just means you're being really precise\\nin your drawings.\\nYou don't have to display these units either.\\nYou can override them in your dimension styles\\nthat we'll cover later.\\nAlso anti-clockwise or counterclockwise\\nis the default direction of measurement\\nfor angles in AutoCAD.\\nBut you can fix it to clockwise there,\\nlike so, if you want to.\\nInsertion scale, you don't need to worry about that.\\nIt should really be millimeters,\\n'cause this drawing is in millimeters.\\nWhen we go into options later,\\nI'll explain how those options can be set.\\n\\nLighting you don't need to worry about.\\nWe're not doing any sort of rendering or visualization,\\nso we don't need to worry about lighting settings.\\nI mentioned direction of angle measurement.\\nYou can see there that the base angle\\nis going to the east, zero degrees.\\nYou can change that around if you need to.\\nThe default is always east, though.\\nAnd I'm going to leave it at east for now.\\nSo I'll okay that. And I'll okay that, like so.\\nSo our drawing units are now set.\\nAnd the way that we can check that\\nis to check our coordinates in our drawing.\\n\\nNow as I move the crosshair around,\\nI'm moving the crosshair in all different directions\\nat the moment, and there's coordinates there.\\nBut how do I get those coordinates to display?\\nI come down here to the customization icon.\\nJust click on the little three bars there,\\nand you'll see coordinates right at the top of the list.\\nClick there like so.\\nThey will now display on the status bar.\\nDown to the three lines again to turn the menu off.\\nAnd there's our coordinates there. Can you see?\\nAnd because they're length coordinates,\\nthey've got two decimal places as I move around.\\n\\nNotice the zero stays static,\\nthat's the z-coordinate.\\nWe're working in 2D, so we've only got x and y.\\nZ is always zero, 'cause we're flat in a 2D flat floor plan.\\nSo as you can see,\\nthat is how you set your units in your AutoCAD drawings.\\nIt's that quick and easy.\\nNow, one thing I will show you,\\nif you want to jump into your unit settings\\nsuch as decimal, architectural, engineering,\\nyou can also down here, on the status bar,\\njump in here, click on the customization.\\n\\nYou'll see that we've got a units option\\nto display on the status bar.\\nSo I'll click on units, like so.\\nClick on the three bars again to close the menu.\\nAnd you can see there that I can now jump in there\\nand it will tell me which methodology I'm using\\nfor my units, which is decimal at the moment.\\nThat's what we set in our unit dialogue box.\\nSo you can check what you're using there\\nby doing that as well.\\nSo that's how you set your units in your AutoCAD drawings.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3995322\",\"duration\":383,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Setting AutoCAD Options\",\"fileName\":\"4261301_en_US_02_02_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":391,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"Please ensure that ALL references to AutoCAD Watt Beta are REMOVED/FADED in THIS chapter!

[Instructor] We're staying in the Units&Options.dwg file\\nfor the moment.\\nNow, in the previous video,\\nI took you through how to set up your units\\nusing the units dialogue box.\\nAnd that was very quick and easy.\\nYou just type the word units and press enter\\nand it brings up the dialogue box\\nand you can go in\\nwithin your AutoCAD drawing.\\nNow in this particular video,\\nwe're going to take a look at the other thing mentioned\\nin the DWG file name, the options.\\nNow there are thousands of options you can set in AutoCAD,\\nbut in order to set those options,\\nyou've got to get to the options dialogue box.\\n\\nNow, the quickest way to do this is\\nto use the right click context sensitive shortcut menu.\\nNow that is shortened to shortcut menu for obvious reasons.\\nI don't want to have to say that to you all the time.\\nSo when I mention shortcut menu,\\nit's simply a right click on the mouse\\nand that context sensitive shortcut menu\\nwill pop up on the screen.\\nNow you'll notice I've got no commands running,\\nnothing selected.\\nSo if I now just right click anywhere\\nin a clear bit of drawing area,\\nyou'll notice a shortcut menu appears.\\nNow, this is just the default shortcut menu\\nwith no commands running, no objects selected.\\n\\nDown at the bottom there you have options.\\nClick on options and that will open up\\nyour options dialogue box.\\nNow all of these options are specific\\nto your install of AutoCAD.\\nNow, there's a lot of stuff going on here, trust me.\\nSo if we go to the files tab first,\\nyou'll see here there's all different files\\nwhere all of your install files\\nare put in various places for AutoCAD\\nto function effectively.\\nNow, the only one that I would worry about there\\nis your automatic save file location.\\n\\nIf I expand that out, you can see that is going to\\nmy temp folder on my hard drive.\\nMy computer name is P 3650.\\nIt's a Precision 3650 Dell,\\nand that's basically the name of the PC.\\nSo it's going to the local temp folder.\\nYou don't really want it going there.\\nIdeally, you want to automatically save your files\\nto say a network folder, a cloud-based folder,\\nso that if your PC does crash,\\nyou can go and find those files remotely.\\nSo what you do there is you'd select that location,\\ngo to browse, and change the location\\nof your automatic save files.\\n\\nYou can see there's lots of other file locations there.\\nI'll let you go and investigate those.\\nMy suggestion is though,\\ndon't go changing anything willy-nilly.\\nDon't do that because obviously you could affect\\nthe running of your AutoCAD.\\nInvestigate where things go, though.\\nIt's very interesting to see\\nwhere all the files are located on your machine.\\nDisplay, this is where you can go in and set colors\\nand what they call color themes.\\nSo what I'm going to do here is\\nI'm going to change some colors for you\\nand just show you how it works.\\n\\nSo if I come down here to colors on this little button here,\\nall of these settings here\\ncan be changed in the drawing window.\\nNow you'll notice the context is 2D model space.\\nWe're in the model tab\\nand it's 2D model space in a flat 2D floor plan.\\nSo at the moment, our uniform background is that color.\\nI'm going to change that to white, like so.\\nNotice the preview there.\\nI'll apply and close, click on apply and close,\\nclick on okay,\\nand you'll notice the background color has changed.\\n\\nNow that's great, but if you change that background color\\nand then right click and go to options again, like so,\\nand then go back to your colors button,\\nyou can see that the uniform background is white.\\nNow if I restore that current element, like so,\\nI'll take it back to the color it was before,\\nas you can see.\\nBut things like your little sort of menu up here,\\ncan you see we've got top and 2D wire frame?\\nThat's our visual styles and our view,\\nour set view in AutoCAD.\\n\\nThey're not showing up.\\nSo you need to set your crosshairs,\\nyou need to restore those,\\nand you need to reset your view port control as well,\\nrestore those.\\nCan you see it comes back in the preview\\nand the crosshair is now white in the preview.\\nApply and close.\\nAnd okay again, and you see our crosshair is back\\nand our view port control, et cetera is all back as well.\\nNow, I'll right click one more time back to options.\\nAnd the one thing that I do want to show you\\nis insertion scale.\\n\\nThat's in our user preferences tab here.\\nThere's lots of other tabs,\\nI'm going to leave you to explore those.\\nAgain, don't rush in and change things.\\nWork out what things do.\\nIf you do change something,\\nmake a note of the setting before you change it.\\nLike your crosshair size, the default is five.\\nSo if you change your crosshair size,\\nif you want it back to the default size,\\nit needs to be five.\\nI'm going to go to user preferences, that tab there,\\nthere's our insertion scale\\nthat was mentioned in the unit style of box.\\n\\nNow if your source drawing is in millimeters\\nand you're copying something to a target drawing\\nand it's also a millimeters,\\nobviously those two would be the same.\\nHowever, you might want to bring in something from a drawing\\nthat's in inches, say.\\nSo if we go here and our source content is in inches\\nand our target drawing is in millimeters,\\nAutoCAD will automatically scale that object.\\nSo if you've got a block of say a chair and it's in inches\\nand you want to bring it across into a millimeters drawing,\\nall you do is set those changes there.\\n\\nYou then drag and drop\\nand AutoCAD will insert the block in millimeters.\\nIt'll scale it up by a factor of around 25.4\\nto make sure that that object is in millimeters,\\nin the millimeters drawing.\\nIn this case, I'm working in millimeters\\nfor let's say both drawings,\\nI've only got one drawing open,\\nbut I might have two drawings open.\\nSo for me, in a UK millimeters metric environment,\\nI'd probably have those both set to millimeters,\\nbut you can chop and change between the two\\nto take content from an imperial drawing\\nto a metric drawing and vice versa.\\n\\nSo I'll leave that with you.\\nI'll click on okay now to make sure that my options are set\\nand that's how you work\\nwith your options dialogue box in AutoCAD.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2029153\",\"duration\":274,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Working with drawings using

like other videos in this chapter,\\nwe're in the 2D floor plan in the Model tab in AutoCAD.\\n\\nCheck that Model tab.\\nBottom left of the corner,\\nmake sure you're in the Model tab.\\nNow, I'm going to use my mouse to zoom in a little bit\\ninto this central sort of grid area here.\\nYou can see some chairs and a green cross and a staircase.\\nI'm going to put the crosshair\\nover that sort of central square,\\nroll up on the wheel a bit to zoom in,\\nand then maybe pan a little bit\\nby holding down the wheel on the mouse and moving the mouse.\\nNow, you can see there that we're zoomed

easy to use.\\nWe don't have to worry about layer names.\\nNow, I'm going to show you how to draw a few items\\nusing your unit settings.\\nNow, if you remember,\\nwe switched on our coordinate setting on the status bar.\\nSo if you look down at the coordinate setting,\\ncan you see, the readout down here is in decimal,\\nas in metric.\\n\\nAnd you can tell it's metric,\\nand you can tell it's metric millimeters\\npurely by the sizes of the numbers.\\nSo you'll notice the x-coordinate there is in the 30,000.\\nNow, you'd normally only have that in say a floor plan\\nif it was in millimeters.\\nIf that was in meters, it might read 30.486\\ninstead of 30486.12.\\nSo you get where I'm coming from with the metric units.\\n\\nNow, what I'm going to do is I'm just going to draw

point\\nnear the crosshair\\nis because Dynamic Input is on.\\nThat, again, is setting down here on the status bar.\\nIt's that one there.\\nMake sure that Dynamic Input or DYNMODE is on.\\nNow, as you move the crosshair around,\\ncan you see, that first point\\nis being displayed in metric units,\\nthose metric millimeters.\\nNow, I'm not worried where that first point is.\\nJust pick a point about here near the staircase.\\nStaircase above,\\nchairs, sofas, et cetera below.\\n\\nClick about there,\\nand you'll see now that we're going\\nfrom that random point we selected.\\nBut now the Dynamic Input\\nis prompting us for an angle and a distance.\\nSo if you bring your crosshair so that it's horizontal,\\nlike that, can you see?\\nOur green polar tracking line kicks in.\\nNow, as we drag along there to the right,\\ncan you see, along that tracking line,\\nwe get a value highlighted in blue.\\nNow, that's in metric millimeters in this case.\\nSo I'm going to type in 2500 like so, and just press enter.\\n\\nAnd there's our line,\\n2 1/2 thousand millimeters long.\\nIf we come downwards like so,\\ncan you see, the tracking line is now going downwards\\nat 90 degrees.\\nAnd I'm going to type in a distance there.\\nLet's say of 1,250, 1250.\\nAgain, it's a metric distance.\\nPress enter.\\nAnd then I can come along this way.\\nAnd can you see, I'm forming a rectangle as I go along.\\nNow, we can cheat.\\nWe can use things like Object Snap Tracking.\\nSo if I go and hover over that endpoint object snap there,\\nand then just drag vertically down,\\nthere's our intersection.\\n\\nClick there, right-click, close on the shortcut menu,\\njob done.\\nAnd that's how you draw with metric units\\nin your AutoCAD drawings.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4001139\",\"duration\":294,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Working with drawings using imperial

[Instructor] Up until now we've been working\\nwith DWG files.\\nThose are your default AutoCAD drawing files.\\nThat's what DWG stands for, drawing.\\nNow sometimes though, you want to be able to have a group\\nof settings set up in a drawing that are standard\\nand this is where your CAD standards start to develop.\\nSo, you might have a standard list of layers\\nthat you're using in an AutoCAD drawing.\\nYou might have a standard set of unit settings\\nthat you might be using in an AutoCAD drawing.\\n\\nSo, what you need to do there is you need\\nto save those settings to what is called\\nan Auto AutoCAD template file.\\nA DWT file, not a D-W-G, a D-W-T.\\nSo what we're going to do, we're going to look at some settings in\\na DWG file, then we're going to save it\\nas a DWT file\\nand then we're going to open up a new drawing from\\nthat template so that you can see how it works.\\nThe drawing you need to open up from the library\\nis called SimpleTemplate.dwg.\\n\\nSo, make sure you've got that downloaded from the library.\\nOpen up the file and you'll see on the screen\\nthere's nothing in the drawing area.\\nNow, you don't want anything in the drawing area ideally.\\nWhat you might want though in your layout tab\\nis something like an ISO A3 Landscape template.\\nThere you go, LinkedIn Learning ISO A3 Landscape.\\nSo, you might have a standard title block in one\\nof your layout tabs, for example.\\nSo there's a typical title block,\\nvery basic just with some notes.\\n\\nIt's obviously LinkedIn Learning ISO A3 Landscape.\\nSo, based on the fact that it's an ISO A3 indicates\\nthat this is all done in metric, which it is.\\nI'm working in metric, it's what I'm used to.\\nWhat you might need to do is convert\\nall of this to imperial.\\nif you were creating an imperial DWT file.\\nI'm going to jump back to the model tab\\nand I'm just going to work from the model tab.\\nThere's nothing in the drawing.\\nAll there is is a title block and some settings\\nand we're going to save that as a template.\\n\\nNow, what settings have we got set up\\nin this particular DWG file?\\nMake sure you're in the home tab on the ribbon\\nand go up to the layers panel.\\nClick on the layer fly out there\\nand you can see we've got some layers set up.\\nThings like center lines, dimensions,\\nhatching, hidden, et cetera.\\nNow these have all got names.\\nIf you were setting up a proper professional CAD standard,\\nthese names would be very different.\\nThey would have different notation completely,\\nbut they're just basic layers\\nthat you might use in a basic drawing.\\n\\nSo, that's our layers there like so.\\nSo, we've got some layers set up in this DWG file.\\nSo, what we're going to do now is check our units.\\nSo, just type units like we've done previously,\\npress enter and the units dialogue box will appear.\\nSo, you can see there we've got decimal for our length\\nwith a precision of two decimal places.\\nOur angle is set to decimal degrees with a precision\\nof four decimal places.\\nWe do not have clockwise ticked\\nso that means we're using\\nthe default counterclockwise direction.\\n\\nInsertion scale, as I said, don't need to worry about it\\nin this particular case.\\nYou can change that later in your options\\nas per the video previously in this chapter,\\ncheck your direction button there like so,\\nwe're using the default east is zero.\\nClick on OK click OK.\\nSo, our units are set as well.\\nSo, we've got units set, we've got layers set.\\nThat's all we're going to worry about\\nas we create this DWT file.\\nSo all we need to do now is go up\\nto the quick access toolbar,\\nsee the little disc there with the pencil on it?\\nSave As, click on that like so.\\n\\nNow you'll see it's defaulting to\\nwhere the drawings for this chapter are saved.\\nThat's because AutoCAD remembers where the drawing\\nthat you've got open is saved\\nand it says, do you want to save it there?\\nNow you'll notice here files of type,\\nI always set them to 2013.\\nThere's a reason for that so that people with older versions\\nof AutoCAD can take this course.\\nBy default, that'll probably read 2018\\nif you haven't changed your settings in your AutoCAD options\\nin the open and save tab.\\n\\nBut I'm just using 2013, yours might say 2018.\\nNow, I don't want to use a DWG file anyway,\\nso I click on the down arrow\\nand I want this one, AutoCAD Drawing Template DWT.\\nSelect that.\\nIt takes you by default\\nto the preset pre-install template folder in AutoCAD.\\nSo, you can see there we've got lots\\nof different templates available.\\nNow, what I'm going to do is I'm going to cheat here.\\nYou can see that the drawing at the top\\nof the screen is called SimpleTemplate.dwg.\\n\\nI'm going to call this simpletemplate.dwt.\\nI'll lose the space though.\\nCheck there's no space in there.\\nWe don't want that messing things up.\\nSo, just check that.\\nThere isn't a space there,\\nbut can you see how it looks like\\nthere might be a space there?\\nBe aware that you don't delete that E or T there as well.\\nSo simple template, DWT,\\nand you're saving it to the default template folder.\\nClick on Save.\\nNow you'll be prompted for your template options.\\n\\nNow the description here, I know\\nthat it's an ISO A3 Landscape template.\\nRemember we looked at that title block, didn't we?\\nSo, I'm just going to call this a simple ISO A3,\\nlet's say landscape\\n'cause it is landscape, landscape template, like that.\\nNow, you can give it whatever name you need.\\nThat is simply a text description there.\\nAnd obviously it's an ISO A3, which is metric.\\nYou might want to give that a different sheet size\\nif you're creating an imperial template.\\n\\nNow the measurement obviously is metric.\\nYou might see this one pop up, English.\\nEnglish is imperial, okay?\\nEnglish is feet and inches\\nand metric is when we decimalized everything.\\nSo, make sure it's set to metric\\nbecause in my case it is a metric template.\\nI don't want English in there.\\nYou can leave the new layer notification,\\nsave all layers as unreconciled.\\nYou don't need to worry about that at all.\\nThat's all about adding new layers when you've created\\nthe template and created a drawing from the template.\\n\\nSo leave that as it is, click on OK.\\nYou'll see a little flash maybe, top left of your screen.\\nThat is AutoCAD saving the template.\\nNow, if you look at the name of the file at the top\\nof the screen now, can you see I've got simpletemplate.dwt.\\nIt is now a template file, okay?\\nNow, what we want to do is we want to create\\na new drawing from that template.\\n\\nNow the good thing is we've saved that\\nto the default template folder in the AutoCAD settings.\\nSo, if I now go up to the quick access toolbar\\nand I click here on new, it'll gimme a list of all\\nof those templates available in the default template folder.\\nDo you recognize this one?\\nSimpletemplate.dwt.\\nThat's the one we've just created.\\nSo, if I now create a new drawing from that template,\\nclick on open, like so, you'll see now\\nthat we have a new drawing open,\\nthere it is there, drawing one.\\n\\nCan you see the file tab?\\nDrawing one at the top\\nof the screen in the title bar as well.\\nIt's got our layer list in place all ready to go,\\nand if I type units\\nand press Enter, you'll see all the unit settings have come\\ninto that new DWG file as well.\\nI'll just click on Cancel there to close the dialogue box.\\nThat's how you create new drawings from a DWT file.\\nThe time saver there is, I have not had\\nto create the layer list.\\n\\nI have not had to go in and set the units.\\nThe template file has remembered those settings.\\nSo, if you've got 600 drawings to do\\nand they've all got the same layer list,\\nthey've all got the same units,\\nthey've all got the same settings,\\nset up a template first\\nand create the new drawings from the template.\\nIf you've got loads of title blocks,\\nmake sure they're saved in the template as well\\nthen you don't have to redraw them, recreate them,\\nimport them from other drawings.\\nThen you've got your standard drawings to work with\\nas DWT files.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

[Instructor] We're starting a new chapter now,\\nand it's all about how you navigate your drawings,\\nyour DWG files in AutoCAD.\\nNow, in this particular video,\\nwe're going to be taking a look at how we zoom\\nand pan in our AutoCAD drawings.\\nThe drawing we've got for you is 00-GND Floor Plan.dwg.\\nYou can see the name of the file in the title bar up there\\nat the top of the screen.\\n00 for ground in the UK.\\n\\nObviously that would be 01 in the USA, for example.\\nBut it's 00-GND Floor Plan.dwg.\\nYou know the drill by now.\\nDownload it from the library\\nto follow along with the videos.\\nNow, when you open up the drawing,\\nit's the usual drill again, as per previous chapters.\\nMake sure you are in the model tab.\\nSo check bottom left of your AutoCAD screen.\\nMake sure that the model tab is current.\\nNow, we're looking at a simple ground floor plan, obviously.\\n\\nNow, obviously we want to be able to zoom\\nand pan to navigate around the drawing\\nbecause it's quite a big drawing.\\nLook at the distances you've got\\non the dimension annotation.\\nWe're looking at approximately 10 meters,\\n10,000 millimeters between each grid line.\\nSo we're looking at a lot of information there.\\nSo this drawing is in metric millimeters,\\nhence the dimension annotation,\\nand we want to zoom and pan around it.\\nNow, the good thing is your mouse is configured\\nto allow you to zoom and pan anyway,\\nso if you take the cross hair anywhere\\nyou want to get to in a drawing,\\nlet's say I want to look at this little conference room,\\nroughly central there in the floor plan.\\n\\nIf I hover the cross hair over the middle of the table\\nand roll up on the wheel of the mouse,\\ncan you see I'm zooming in, like so?\\nIf I roll back on the wheel of the mouse,\\nI'm zooming out.\\nNow, that's really cool.\\nEach little increment of the mouse wheel as well.\\nCan you see I've got a mouse wheel\\nthat clicks with increments.\\nSo each increment zooms me in an increment\\nto the drawing as well,\\nwhich is really quite useful.\\nNow, obviously that allows me to zoom in and zoom out,\\nbut sometimes if I keep zooming in,\\nI might get to a point where I can't really see\\nthe detail of the drawing anymore.\\n\\nNow, if that does happen,\\njust simply double click on the wheel of your mouse\\nas if it was a mouse button.\\nSo it's a double click,\\nand that will automatically zoom to the extents\\nof the visible objects in your AutoCAD drawing,\\nwhatever space you're in,\\nwhether that be the model tab or a layout tab.\\nIt's a very useful tool.\\nSo that's how you can zoom,\\nbut then you can combine zoom with pan.\\nSo if I zoom in a bit again,\\nlet's zoom in on that table again like I did before,\\nand then hold down the mouse wheel,\\nyou'll see this little hand up here,\\nand as I move around,\\ncan you see I'm moving the mouse\\nand holding down the mouse wheel\\nand it's allowing me to pan around the drawing as well.\\n\\nReally useful for detail in your drawing.\\nSo I might want to zoom in and detail a chair like that.\\nCan you see I'm really close in now.\\nHold down the mouse wheel and I can pan, like so.\\nIt's incredibly useful.\\nAnd then when I want to get to the extent,\\ndouble click on the mouse wheel takes me to the extent\\nof the visible drawn objects again.\\nSo that's just literally using the wheel on your mouse.\\nSo that's one way of getting around your drawing.\\n\\nNow, zooming and panning can also be done over here\\non what is known as the navigation bar.\\nThere's pan there.\\nNow, you can use the navigation bar.\\nThere's pan.\\nThere's also all the zoom tools there as well.\\nIf I click on that down fly out there,\\ncan you see zoom extent, et cetera.\\nSo I'll get into those in a moment.\\nBut I can also just right click\\nand you'll notice I've got pan and zoom there as well.\\nSo if I click on pan on the shortcut menu\\nwhen I right click, I get this little hand.\\nNow, the hand looks like it's outstretched this time.\\n\\nIf I left click and hold,\\ncan you see it's holding onto the drawing\\nand allowing me to pan around.\\nRelease the mouse button, it releases the drawing,\\nbut I'm still in pan mode.\\nIf I right click now, I can go to zoom, like so.\\nI get a magnifying glass.\\nHold down the left hand mouse button and move up.\\nYou zoom in, see the plus symbol?\\nHold down the left hand mouse button and move down.\\nYou zoom out, see the little minus symbol there\\nnext to the magnifying glass?\\nSo you're zooming up and down, in and out.\\n\\nAnd you'll notice it's not in increments this time\\nlike it is on the mouse wheel.\\nTo get out of that pan and zoom,\\nit's a right click and exit on the shortcut menu.\\nSo that's how you would do it on the shortcut menu.\\nI mentioned the navigation bar.\\nNotice if I click on pan there,\\ntakes me into the same mode that we've just used.\\nSo if I right click now, I can exit to get out of pan.\\nLast but not least, I've got all my zoom tools here.\\nClick on the fly out there on the navigation bar,\\nzoom extent, zoom window, zoom previous.\\n\\nI'm going to leave it up to you to investigate\\nhow all of those work.\\nUtilize your AutoCAD help if you need to as well,\\nif you get stuck.\\nOne of them I will show you that I love is zoom window.\\nIf I click on zoom window, it prompts me now for a corner.\\nSo if I click, say, there,\\ndrag my window to, say, there and click again,\\nzooms me to the extent of that window.\\nIncredibly useful if I need to zoom in\\nand zoom out quickly.\\nZoom window's very useful.\\n\\nAgain, it's a double click on the mouse wheel\\nto zoom extent again.\\nSo that's utilizing zoom and pan in your AutoCAD drawings.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3995320\",\"duration\":274,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Working in model space and paper space in

[Instructor] We're staying\\nin our 00-Ground Floor Plan.dwg file.\\nAnd at the moment we are in our model tab.\\nNow, this is something that you need\\nto consider when you are working with AutoCAD.\\nAll of your design work happens\\nin the model tab full size.\\nThe model space in AutoCAD is infinite\\nand it is defined by your X and Y.\\n\\nAnd if you're working in 3D, Z axes,\\nso you're working with coordinates in those X,\\nY, and Z axes.\\nNow, normally in your drawing you would see\\nwhat is called a UCS icon.\\nNow, at the moment, I haven't got it switched on,\\nso I'm just going to show you that first.\\nType UCS icon, all one word like that, press enter.\\nAnd can you see there, mine is currently set to off.\\nSo if I click on on, there's our little UCS icon there.\\n\\nNow, the whole idea\\nof model space is it's infinite in those X and Y directions.\\nThe X and the Y on the UCS icon there,\\nY going upwards is positive.\\nY going downwards is negative.\\nX going to the right is positive.\\nX going to the left is negative.\\nSo that's how our coordinates work in our model space.\\nAnd as I said, it's infinite, so you can draw anything\\nand everything full size.\\nNow, you need to get that full size floor plan,\\nwhich is roughly 30 meters by 30 meters\\nonto a sheet of paper.\\n\\nNow, it doesn't matter whether that's a physical sheet\\nof paper or an electronic piece of paper,\\nsay a PDF for example.\\nYou have to make sure that you can communicate\\nthat design intent using what they call the layout tabs,\\nwhich is sometimes known old fashionly\\nor more traditionally as paper space.\\nSo you've got model space and paper space.\\nIf you think about it, model space,\\nthe model tab is where you model and you design.\\nPaper space is where you print\\nand communicate your design.\\nSo the layout tabs,\\nthe paper space are where you communicate.\\n\\nIn this drawing,\\nif you click on the ISO A1 Landscape layout tab,\\nyou can see there that there is a sheet of paper\\nwith a little rectangle\\nand it is actually showing your floor plan\\nin that rectangle.\\nNow, that is a sheet of paper\\nand it's an ISO A1 sheet, which is,\\nif I remember rightly, 841 millimeters by 594 millimeters.\\nDon't quote me on that, I think it is.\\nYou can check that if you want to just\\nby hovering perhaps there and moving along.\\n\\nIf I go along to there,\\ncan you see the cross hair?\\nIt's telling me there how big that is.\\nNow, at the moment, it's an ISO A1.\\nNow, what I need to check here is this little box here.\\nNow, if I hover over it, can you see it's a view port?\\nAnd if I hover there, it pops up\\nand it tells me it's using a standard scale of one to 100.\\nSo what I've done, my model tab here,\\neverything is full size.\\nIf I go in and say measure a doorway,\\nthere's a doorway there.\\n\\nLet's zoom in on that doorway and I'll go to measure here.\\nIt's on the home tab, on the ribbon, on the utilities panel.\\nIf I measure a distance there,\\nclick on distance from the flyout, use that endpoint snap\\nto that endpoint snap.\\nSo that is 1155.70 millimeters wide, that doorway,\\nso about 1.155 meters or 1155 millimeters.\\nSo that's how big that is.\\n\\nNow, here's the trick.\\nIf I go back here, I'm never going to fit\\nthat on an ISO A1 sheet.\\nSo I've made it a hundredth\\nof its original size in a view port.\\nSo that's how you make sure\\nthat you communicate your design intent in AutoCAD.\\nYou make sure that in the model tab here,\\nI'll just double click on the wheel to zoom extents.\\nEverything is drawn full size.\\nAnd then you put your designs\\ninto scaled view ports in the paper space\\non the layout tab.\\n\\nNow, we do get into that a bit more deeply\\nas we work throughout the course.\\nYou'll see how to set up view ports, set up page setups so\\nthat you can communicate your designs\\nfrom the model tab into the layout tabs,\\ninto the paper space.\\nBut that's how you work with model space, the model tab,\\nand paper space, the layout tabs in AutoCAD.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3995319\",\"duration\":466,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Navigating easily by saving and restoring views

[Instructor] Once again,\\nwe are staying in our 00-GND Floor Plan.dwg file.\\nAnd in this particular video,\\nyou'll notice I've returned us back\\nto the Model tab in the drawing.\\nSo, make sure you're in the Model tab.\\nNow, as I mentioned previously,\\nthis is quite a large floor plan.\\nIt's roughly 30 meters by 30 meters approximately,\\nbut that's a lot of space to navigate in a drawing\\nwhen you need to keep zooming in and out to work on details,\\nspecifically in the drawing itself.\\n\\nYou might need to go to a specific room\\nand edit objects in a specific room,\\nlike chairs, desks, tables.\\nOr, perhaps in the restrooms,\\nyou might be changing the layout of the restrooms,\\nperhaps for disabled access or something along those lines.\\nNow, sometimes you will return to specific areas\\nin your drawing to work on specific objects.\\nNow what's really nice about AutoCAD\\nis you can save those views that you need to get to.\\nThey're called named views in AutoCAD,\\nand you can save them and restore them\\nto get back to those views quickly and easily.\\n\\nNow what we're going to do\\nis we're going to create a couple of those named views.\\nNow the workflow for this does differ\\ndepending on what version of AutoCAD you're using.\\nNow the drawing itself\\nis saved all the way back to the 2013 DWG file format.\\nSo, that means that you can open up this drawing\\nusing AutoCAD 2013 and above,\\nbut the workflow differs in those versions from 2013\\nto this, the latest version 2026.\\n\\nSo, what we've got to do is kind of cover those workflows\\nand processes.\\nSo, let's do that.\\nNow, if you're working with more recent versions of AutoCAD,\\nyou can go to the View tab on the ribbon,\\nand you'll notice here, we have the View Manager\\nin the Named Views panel.\\nIf I click there, that will open up the View Manager.\\nThere's the View Manager dialogue box.\\nI'll cancel that for the moment.\\nNow, you might not have the Named Views panel\\nin your View tab on your ribbon\\nif you're using an older version of AutoCAD.\\n\\nSo, can you see here where it says the word top?\\nThat's our view controls there.\\nIf I click on the word top,\\nyou'll see there that we have View Manager.\\nIf I click there, opens up exactly the same dialogue box.\\nSo, newer versions of AutoCAD,\\nyou can go to the View Tab on the ribbon\\nand view manager there.\\nOlder versions of AutoCAD,\\nyou click on top on the view controls\\nand go to view manager there, like so.\\nI'll click on Cancel just to close that for the moment.\\n\\nNow, we are going to create two new views.\\nWe're going to create a large conference room view\\nand a restroom view, and they're quick and easy to do.\\nSo, let's go to the View tab on the ribbon\\ninto the View Manager,\\nor click on top and go to the View Manager there.\\nEither way, you get to this dialogue box.\\nNow, we're working in model views at the moment.\\nSo, click on Model Views,\\ngives you a little bit of a breakdown\\nabout what Model Views are all about.\\nYou need to click on new.\\n\\nSo, let's do the restrooms first.\\nSo, the view name, we'll just call it Restrooms, like so.\\nThe view category, you can type it in.\\nNow, what I might do here\\nis give it a 2D Plan category, like that.\\n2D Plan category.\\nThe View Type will be Still, not Cinematic or Recorded Walk.\\nThose are for 3D.\\nWe click on Still.\\nBoundary will be Current display or Defined window.\\nWe'll look at that in a moment.\\n\\nClick on this arrow here.\\nMake sure you expand it out, like so.\\nSee?\\nYou get a condensed dialogue there.\\nSo, make sure you expand the dialogue.\\nAnd you see there's various settings here.\\nThis little tick box is important.\\nIt will remember your layer visibility settings\\nwith the Named View.\\nSo, if you've got specific layers\\nthat are displayed or not displayed, it'll remember those.\\nSo, really useful little tick box.\\nGoing back to the boundary of our view,\\nwe can click on Define window.\\n\\nWe can use the Current display,\\nwhich is what is viewed in the model tab right now.\\nOr, we can define what we want in that Named View.\\nIf you click on Define window or click on this icon,\\neither one works.\\nSo, button, icon doesn't matter.\\nTakes you into the drawing.\\nNow, the black area at the moment\\nis the boundary of that view.\\nNow we want the restrooms.\\nThey're down here.\\nAnd what I would do is click about there,\\ndrag the box around the restrooms.\\n\\nThey're there, like that.\\nGo into about there.\\nTry not to snap to objects when you do this as well.\\nTry and avoid objects.\\nSo, there's our little black area\\nof that view that we want.\\nNotice on the dynamic input on the crosshair,\\npress Enter to accept.\\nSo, I press Enter.\\nSo, that's accepted that view.\\nYou can leave everything else as it is.\\nClick on OK.\\nThere's our restrooms view there.\\nNow, I'm going to click on OK and close that.\\n\\nI'm then going to double-click on the wheel of the mouse.\\nThat will zoom to the extents, like we talked about earlier.\\nNow, the other one we want is the large conference room.\\nIt's up here, top right corner.\\nSo, again, View, View Manager there,\\nor Top and View Manager there.\\nThere's our model views.\\nClick on New.\\nAnd we'll call this one large conference room.\\nI might put just something like C-O-N-F and then R-O-O-M,\\nlike that.\\n\\nView Category, it's remembered what we typed previously,\\n2D Plan.\\nSo, I can just click on the down arrow and select that.\\nView Type is Still still, if you're pardon the pun.\\nClick on the Define view window icon again.\\nTakes us into the drawing area.\\nYou might want to zoom in a bit.\\nAnd I'm going to click, say there,\\ndrag that around to, say there.\\nTry not to snap on objects, if you can avoid it.\\nSo, I'm going sort of in that sort of area there\\nnear the door and click there.\\n\\nNow, it's kind of off the screen,\\nso I might pan a little bit.\\nSo, you can see that.\\nAnd again, you've got the prompt there on the crosshair,\\nEnter to accept, like so.\\nSave layer snapshot with view is still active.\\nThat's ticked.\\nClick on OK.\\nAnd it's added the large conference room\\nand the restrooms to the model views.\\nClick on OK.\\nNow, to see the benefit of this,\\ndouble-click on the wheel on the mouse to zoom to extent.\\nNow, if I now go to my views here in the Named Views here,\\nI've now got Large Conf Room, Restrooms.\\n\\nSo, if I select Large Conf Room,\\nzooms me into that boundary that we set.\\nClick on the down arrow again,\\ngo to Restrooms, zooms me into the restrooms, like so.\\nSo, it remembers those named views.\\nNow, if I go here to where it says, \\\"Restrooms,\\\"\\nand go to Custom Model Views,\\nthere's my large conference room.\\nAgain, click there, Custom Model Views, Restrooms.\\nSo, you can see there that I can get around.\\nAnd it doesn't matter which version of AutoCAD I'm using,\\nthere's a way to get to those saved views either way.\\n\\nI'll double-click on the wheel now\\nto zoom extends to the visible drawing objects.\\nSo, that's how you work with those named views\\nin your AutoCAD drawings.\\nAnd if you save your drawing,\\nthose named views are saved in the DWG file.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2027360\",\"duration\":409,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Working with the mouse and mouse

[Instructor] Once again,\\nwe're staying in our 00- Ground Flour Plan .dwg,\\nand again, we're in the Model tab\\nzoomed to the extent of the floor plan in the drawing.\\nNow we're going to take a look now at how we navigate\\nusing our mouse and our mouse settings.\\nNow, these are really important settings in AutoCAD,\\nour mouse settings, especially.\\nNow, I've obviously shown you already\\nhow to zoom and pan using the mouse.\\n\\nSo you move the crosshair around,\\nyou pick a point in the drawing and you don't click on it.\\nYou just position the crosshair,\\nroll up on the wheel of the mouse and you zoom in,\\nroll back on the wheel of the mouse, and you zoom out.\\nHold down the wheel of the mouse like so,\\nand move the mouse and you can see you pan.\\nRelease the wheel,\\nand then you come out of that pan mode.\\nAgain, like I mentioned, though,\\nyou can right click and use pan and zoom there,\\nand if I hit escape to lose the shortcut menu,\\nyou can also zoom and pan here using the navigation bar.\\n\\nNow those mouse settings are set normally by default.\\nI very, very rarely change my mouse settings.\\nSo normally if I'm not doing anything,\\nand I right click, it brings up the shortcut menu.\\nNow there are other bits of functionality.\\nI'll just hit escape to lose that menu there.\\nThere are other bits of functionality, though,\\nfor the mouse.\\nLet me show you what I mean.\\nI'm going to zoom in\\non that central grid square near the stairs.\\n\\nNow I'm just going to make sure I'm on the 0 layer\\nup at the top of the list there.\\nThere you go, 0 layer,\\nand I'm going to go to the line command on the draw panel,\\non the home tab on the ribbon.\\nNow obviously I've got dynamic input on,\\nso I get a prompt\\nfor the first point of that particular line.\\nSo if I click and I drag the mouse,\\ncan you see the mouse is forming\\na fundamental freehand methodology of moving there?\\nNow, I can type in distances,\\nangles, coordinates, et cetera,\\nbut if I just move the mouse, can you see,\\nit's allowing me to specify the direction\\nand the angle of the line.\\n\\nSo if I drag say there and left click,\\nthe mouse is now acting\\nas a human interface device for me to click.\\nIf I come down here, left click again, another line segment.\\nIf I come down here, left click again, another line segment.\\nNow here's the important bit.\\nI can right click, and on the shortcut menu,\\nit's now contact sensitive,\\nbecause I'm in the line command, I can undo a line segment.\\nSo if I click on that, takes me back one line segment,\\nplace that line segment again by left clicking,\\nas you can see.\\n\\nI can then right click and I can close out\\nto the first point of the group of line segments.\\nSo if I click on close,\\nit closes out to where I started from.\\nSo you can see there\\nthat that right click and enter is really important.\\nNow, sometimes just pressing enter on the keyboard\\ncan be your preferred method of doing that line.\\nLet's do another line.\\nI'll do the same thing again.\\nClick, click, click, click.\\n\\nNow I don't need to right click now.\\nIf I right click and close,\\nit'll take me back to the start point,\\nbut if I just press enter on the keyboard,\\ncan you see there?\\nIt just closes out the line command\\nand finishes the line command for me.\\nIt doesn't close out to the beginning point.\\nSo it does depend on what you're trying to get\\nfrom that line command.\\nYou can either right click and close,\\nor you can just press enter and it finishes the line command\\nwithout closing, like it's done there.\\nNow I can set my mouse settings in my options\\nto combine the two.\\n\\nSo without anything running or selected,\\njust right click and go to Options.\\nNow you'll notice in the User Preferences tab,\\nthere is right click customization.\\nSo this is our Windows,\\nas in Microsoft Windows Standard Behavior.\\nI've got double click editing on,\\nso if I double click on an object, I can edit it.\\nMy shortcut menus are in the drawing area,\\nso they come on when I right click.\\nLet's go to that right click customization.\\nNow, I never change Default mode,\\nEdit mode, or Command mode.\\n\\nI leave them as they are.\\nSo you can leave those as they are.\\nIt's this one at the top.\\nTurn on the time sensitive right click.\\nA quick click will basically\\nreplicate the enter key on the keyboard.\\nA longer click will display the shortcut menu.\\nLet's switch that on.\\nJust tick the box,\\nleave it set to the two 50 milliseconds, the default,\\napply and close, and then OK that.\\nNow this is where it gets interesting.\\nWhat I am going to do,\\nI'm just going to select each of these lines that I've drawn.\\n\\nJust click on each one like that.\\nNow, here's the bit that's interesting.\\nIf I now just quickly right click,\\ncan you see that it brings up the shortcut menu,\\nbecause I've got objects selected.\\nSo what I'm going to do there is I'm going to click on erase.\\nI'm going to do the same here.\\nOne and two and three, quick right click and erase.\\nNow this is where it gets interesting.\\nLet's go back to that line command.\\n\\nI'm going to click there, pick a point, click again,\\nclick again, click again,\\nquick click on the right hand mouse button.\\nIt's like I pressed the enter key.\\nThe shortcut menu hasn't appeared\\nbecause I've set that delay in the settings in my options.\\nLet's do that again.\\nLine command.\\nSo it's click, draw the line, click, draw the line, click,\\ndraw the line, click.\\nNow if I right click and hold,\\nthere's the context sensitive shortcut menu.\\n\\nI can click on close.\\nSo I'm kind of combining the two settings\\nby setting that little time delay of 250 milliseconds.\\nSo if I hold the right click mouse button down,\\nit brings up the shortcut menu.\\nIf I do a quick click\\non the right hand mouse button, though,\\nit replicates the enter key on the keyboard.\\nMake sure if you don't want that setting,\\nyou right click.\\nAs you can see, right click is repeating the last command.\\nHit escape there.\\n\\nI want to right click and hold\\nand then go down to the options.\\nI then go into right click customization,\\nand turn that option off if you don't want to use it.\\nI don't use it.\\nI don't turn it on.\\nbut it's a really useful tool\\nif you want to combine enter and the shortcut menu.\\nSo I'll apply and close, click on OK,\\nand those settings are back to where they were\\nwhen we started the video.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3995318\",\"duration\":311,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Utilizing the ViewCube and the

you're looking at this in the Model tab,\\nmake sure you're in the Model tab,\\nyou might think that it's just a group of lines and circles\\nrepresenting some objects.\\nIt's not, it is actually the top view\\nof a simple 3D object,\\nhence the name of the file.\\n\\nNow, the way that you can check this\\nis you can change the visual style of the 3D object.\\nIf you go over to the top-left part\\nof the drawing area there,\\ncan you see it says, \\\"2D Wireframe?\\nIf I click there like so\\nand change this to Conceptual,\\nyou'll see that the visual style changes.\\nYou might get a prompt about Fast Shaded mode,\\nyou can click on a cross there\\njust to close that for the moment.\\nSo you can now see it's definitely a 3D object.\\nIt's a simple 3D solid that I've created\\nwith some beveled edges\\nand some filleted corners\\nand things and so on.\\n\\nNow, at the moment,\\nwe are now looking at that from the top view.\\nThe view cube here\\nsays that we are in the top

view,\\nhit Escape to lose the menu,\\nand then click on the left option,\\nmake sure the central bit there,\\nthe left option on the view cube,\\nyou're now looking at the left-hand side of that 3D

the mouse,\\nas you can see, roll up and down on the mouse,\\nhold down the wheel,\\nNow, what I'd like you to do is zoom and pan\\nso that you get a nice southwest isometric view there\\non screen.\\nSo get it so it fills the screen nicely.\\nGo and hover over the view cube, like so,\\nand right-click.\\nOn that shortcut menu that pops up,\\nset the current view as home.\\n\\nThat is now your home view on the view cube.\\nSo if you now go to the top view,\\nsee the top there?\\nClick on top, there's the top view.\\nYou can rotate the top view\\nusing the arrows like that.\\nCan you see that?\\nCan rotate it to different points of the compass.\\nThere's a little house symbol,\\nthat's your home icon.\\nClick on it, it will take you to that southwest isometric\\nthat you saved as the home view.\\nNow, other things you can do in your 3D views like so,\\nnotice as well that the UCS icon, bottom-left corner,\\nis now colored X, Y and Z.\\n\\nEach axis has a color 'cause you're working in 3D.\\nNow, if I go over the navigation bar here\\nand click on the flyout here for navigation wheels,\\nI'm going to use the full navigation wheel.\\nJust leave that set ticked, Full Navigation Wheel.\\nAnd then click on the navigation wheel.\\nNow I can orbit, I can zoom,\\nI can rewind, I can pan.\\nClick on orbit on the navigation wheel.\\nAnd notice you need to click and hold.\\nSo as I move now,\\nI can move the mouse around and I can pivot.\\n\\nPivot on the navigation wheel\\nallows me to do a 3D orbit.\\nSo if I leave it like that,\\nrelease the mouse, can you see?\\nI go back to the navigation wheel.\\nNow, I can rewind, click and hold,\\nand I can rewind back\\nwith the views that I've been looking at.\\nCan you see that there?\\nSo as I rewind back,\\ncan you see each frame kind of kicks in\\nall the way back to the beginning to where we started?\\nSo I can flick through each view\\nthat I may have used like so,\\nall the way back to there.\\n\\nNow, to close the navigation wheel,\\nyou click on the little cross.\\nYou can also play around\\nwith all the different settings on there if you wish.\\nI'm going to close it now by clicking on the cross.\\nGo to the view cube,\\nclick on the home,\\nNow, obviously when we first opened up this drawing,\\nwe were looking at the view from the top.\\nSo let's go to the top on the

drafting method.\\nWe're going to utilize coordinates,\\nwhich tends to be the more traditional way\\nof drafting in AutoCAD,\\nand I'm going to show you how to draft using coordinate entry.\\nSo in order to do that,\\nwe're going to utilize grid and snap first to draw a circle.\\n\\nSo we're going to go up to the draw panel\\non the home tab on the ribbon,\\nclick on the flyout here for circle,\\nand we're going to go center, radius.\\nNow your grid and your snap are still switched on\\non the status bar at this point,\\nand what I'd like you to do\\nis I'd like you to select the end there.\\nCan you see the end of that line\\nwhere we started doing the gear teeth?\\nClick there and come out one grid square,\\nand click again for the radius like that,\\nand as you can see, that's placed a circle.\\nNow we're going to utilize the center snap of that circle\\nto replicate our rectangle here,\\nbut we're going to do it using coordinates\\ninstead of grid and snap.\\n\\nNow before we do anything else,\\nwe're going to go down to grid and snap here\\nand switch them off.\\nSo click on grid mode there, turn it off,\\nclick on that one there, snap mode, turn it off.\\nTurn on your polar tracking,\\nturn on your object snap tracking, and your object snaps,\\nand then go to the flyout for object snaps\\non the arrow there.\\nJust make sure that endpoint midpoint center are on,\\nand also intersection and extension like so.\\nHit escape to lose the object snap menu\\nor just click in the drawing.\\n\\nNow we're going to remove the objects that we don't need,\\nso that's going to be this line here.\\nClick on each line, and as you can see, each one of those,\\nthe grips appear when they're selected like that.\\nClick on each of those lines\\nthat you've created using grid and snap.\\nIt's just a right click now and arrays on the shortcut menu.\\nSo now we've got the center snap of this circle.\\nNow we're going to utilize the center snap of the circle\\nto generate four lines that look like this rectangle here.\\n\\nNow you'll remember the long edge of the rectangle\\nwas five squares, so that was 250 long,\\nand the short edge of the rectangle\\nwas three squares, 150 long,\\nbecause our squares were set to increments of 50 units.\\nNow I'm not worried about what the units are.\\nThere could be millimeters,\\nthere could be even be miles if you wanted them to be,\\nbut no, we're not going to worry about that.\\nWe're just going to worry about the unit\\nand the distance that we're working with.\\nSo I now go to the line command on the draw panel,\\non the home tab on the ribbon,\\nand I'm going to just touch on the edge of the circle.\\n\\nSee the dynamic input kicks in?\\nThere's that center snap that we need.\\nSo I click there on the center snap,\\nand as you can see, I can move around now\\nand I can place a line from the center of the circle.\\nNow we're going to drag to the right.\\nNow you'll notice the polar tracking kicks in.\\nThat kind of gives away the angle.\\nWhat I'd like you to do\\nis go down to polar tracking, and turn it off.\\nSo now there's no angles, just a distance.\\nDynamic input does give you the option to put an angle in,\\nbut we're not going to worry about that.\\n\\nNow the good thing is if I type the at symbol now,\\ncan you see that the dynamic input\\nsuddenly stops giving me the angle and the distance,\\nbecause it knows that I'm using coordinate entry.\\nNow, X and Y, bottom left corner,\\nshow me the X to the right is positive,\\nY upwards is also positive.\\nSo we're going to the right,\\nso it's going to be a positive 250 along the X axis.\\nThen a comma.\\nType the comma as if you're writing down the coordinate.\\n\\nNow what we're going to do is we're going to use zero,\\nbecause we're not going anywhere in the Y direction at all.\\nSo we put zero in.\\nWhen I press enter, watch what happens.\\nThat line is now 250 long along the X-axis.\\nI now need to go vertically, so the X value will be zero.\\nSo again, I type at.\\nAutoCAD goes, oh, you're typing in a coordinate,\\nso the X value will be zero,\\nand then we type the comma again,\\nand notice I've kind of hit the comma twice there.\\n\\nMake sure that comma disappears in that box there.\\nI've just backspaced it.\\nSo it's zero, and then we need to go upwards,\\nso Y is positive 150.\\nI then press enter to confirm,\\nand there's our vertical line.\\nNow I need to come back the other way,\\nso if I'm going to the left in the X direction,\\nthat's going to be a negative X value.\\nSo again, it's an at like so, -250.\\nNow you can use the tab key instead of the comma key.\\n\\nSo if I tab now, takes me to that,\\nand then I'm just going to type zero in there.\\nThat's it, zero.\\nSo it's 250 to the left along the X-axis,\\nnegative because we're going to the left,\\nand the zero means\\nthat we're not going up or down in the Y-axis.\\nPress enter to confirm\\nand you'll see that that draws in our horizontal line.\\nNow the good thing is I don't need to worry\\nabout getting to that first point,\\nbecause I can just right click and close like so.\\n\\nAnd there you go.\\nI've got another rectangle\\nexactly the same as the other one,\\nbut this time I've used coordinates instead,\\nand you can see there that the coordinates\\ncan be positive or negative\\nwhen you're working in the model space in AutoCAD.\\nSo that's how quick and easy it is\\nto utilize coordinates in your AutoCAD drawings.\\nOne of the things I would suggest here,\\na bit of a call to action, maybe.\\nGo and investigate\\nhow coordinates actually fully work in AutoCAD.\\nYou can use the at symbol for relative coordinates.\\n\\nYou can use the hashtag symbol for absolute coordinates.\\nGo and check out what absolute coordinates do as well.\\nThey both work in similar ways,\\nbut absolute coordinates\\nare relative to the origin point, 0,0,\\nwhereas relative coordinates with the at symbol\\nare relative to the last point selected.\\nGo and check that out in your AutoCAD help.\\nIt's an interesting read.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3995317\",\"duration\":194,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Utilizing Dynamic Input (DYNMODE) in

[Instructor] In this new chapter,\\nwe're going to be taking a look at\\nhow we create basic simple geometry\\nin your AutoCAD drawings.\\nNow we have a drawing for you\\nthat you'll probably recognize from previous videos.\\nIt is that floor plan.\\nIt's called Ground Floor Plan, gndfloorplan.dwg.\\nYou can download it from the library\\nto follow along with the videos as usual.\\nNow what we're going to do in this particular video\\nis we're going to take a look at object snaps\\nand what they call AutoSnap,\\nwhich is object snap tracking.\\n\\nNow before we start drawing anything,\\nwe're going to make sure we're on an appropriate layer.\\nWe're going to draw some furniture,\\nso we want to be on the furniture layer.\\nSo home tab on the ribbon, layers panel, layer dropdown.\\nAnd you want this layer here, A-700-M_FFE.\\nAnd that's the layer for furniture\\nin this particular drawing.\\nThen we're going to zoom into an area\\nwhere we're going to place the furniture.\\nIt's going to be this grid square here.\\nCan you see there's two little circular tables with chairs.\\nYou want that square there.\\n\\nSo get it nice and tight like that.\\nGet it all zoomed in on the screen\\nso that you're not squinting at your AutoCAD screen.\\nSo we're on the right layer,\\nwe're in the right area of the drawing.\\nWe now need to think about what we're going to draw.\\nWe're going to use the rectangle command\\nto draw the outline of a table.\\nSo the rectangle command is on the draw panel,\\non the home tab on the ribbon.\\nThere's draw.\\nAnd if we go up top right of the panel,\\nclick on this little fly out here.\\nYou've got a choice of rectangle or polygon.\\n\\nYou want rectangle.\\nClick on it and come into the drawing area\\nand you'll be prompted for a corner point.\\nPick a point in the grid area here somewhere.\\nI'm going to click there.\\nClick once and drag upwards like so\\nso you can see your rectangle starting to take shape.\\nNow the good thing\\nis you can use direct distance entry here.\\nSo you can just type things in.\\nSo we're going to type in \\\"3500\\\"\\nas the long side of the table.\\nThen press the tab key, and type \\\"2500\\\"\\nas the shorter side of the table, the vertical side.\\n\\nTab again, and you'll see that kind of locks that in.\\nCan you see the little padlocks appear\\non the distances there?\\nAnd then just press enter.\\nThere is your rectangle at those specific sizes.\\nDrafting accurately in AutoCAD,\\nyou're going to use your object snaps\\nand your AutoSnap a lot.\\nThey are located on your status bar.\\nSo let's have a look down here.\\nYou've got your polar tracking there,\\nwhich we've used previously.\\nMoving along though, here's AutoSnap,\\nour object snap tracking.\\n\\nThat's it.\\nIt's just either on or off.\\nAnd here as well, we've got our object snaps.\\nThe little arrow there.\\nClick on it, you can set your running object snaps.\\nDon't switch them all on.\\nIt will really drive you insane\\nwhen it tries to snap to everything.\\nYou just want these five running object snaps.\\nEndpoint, midpoint, center,\\nintersection and extension will do fine.\\nJust click once in the drawing to lose that menu.\\nNow we're going to draw three different ways\\nof creating a circular insert on this table.\\n\\nNow they're all different methods of object snaps\\nand also your AutoSnap, your object snap tracking.\\nSo let's go for the most basic one.\\nI'm going to go up to the draw panel.\\nClick on the line command,\\nand I'm going to hover over this corner.\\nThere's my endpoint snap, left click.\\nCome down to this diagonal opposing corner here.\\nEndpoint snap, left click.\\nAnd then it's either a right click and enter,\\nor you can just press your enter key.\\nWe then go up to the circle command on the draw panel,\\nclick on the flyout and select Center Radius.\\n\\nCome down here we get a midpoint snap.\\nWe know that's the center of that rectangle\\nbecause it's on the diagonal.\\nSo we left click on the midpoint, drag out.\\nOur radius is 900.\\nType in \\\"900\\\" for the radius, press enter.\\nThere's our circle.\\nWe click on the line there.\\nRight click and erase it.\\nSo that's one way of putting the circle dead center,\\nthe geometric center, I hasten to add, of that rectangle.\\nOkay, select the circle.\\n\\nClick on it, you'll see the grips appear.\\nRight click and erase it.\\nLet's use our AutoSnap now.\\nNow make sure the AutoSnap is on.\\nAs you can see, mine is on down there.\\nAutoSnap is on.\\nNow this is object snap tracking.\\nNow in your object snaps, I ask you to make sure\\nthat you have things like extension and intersection on.\\nLet's see how they work with AutoSnap on, shall we?\\nSo we go up to the circle command, click on the fly out\\nand select Center Radius again.\\nCome into the drawing area.\\n\\nNow just hover over that midpoint\\nof the vertical side of the table.\\nAnd then we come up here, hover over the midpoint\\nof the horizontal side of the table.\\nDrag the mouse gently downwards.\\nYou'll see a polar tracking line kick in.\\nAnd then as it intersects with the other midpoint\\nthat we hovered over, can you see there\\nthat we now have an intersection?\\nLeft click and you'll see your circle\\nis on that intersection.\\nIt's centered on that intersection.\\nAnd again, we type in the 900 and enter.\\n\\nAnd there's our circle placed\\nin the geometric center position on that table again.\\nNow, beware with those midpoints though.\\nDon't click on them.\\nYou hover.\\nYou hover over the midpoint, hover over the midpoint,\\ndrag down to the center of the rectangle there,\\nand then all of a sudden you'll see those two intersections\\nof those green dash lines.\\nThat's where you want to be.\\nAnd you click and you circle center is placed.\\nSo that's using the AutoSnap.\\nNow there's another really nice object snap in AutoCAD.\\n\\nLet's click on the circle.\\nRight click, erase the circle.\\nNow you don't have to do any of that at all,\\nbecause our rectangle is what they call a closed polyline.\\nSo basically those lines are all joined together\\nto form a polyline.\\nWe'll talk about polylines later.\\nBut as you can see, it's all one object.\\nSo it must have a geometric center of its own.\\nAnd there's a lovely snap,\\nan object snap called geometric center.\\nBut we'll use it in a different way.\\nWe won't switch it on down here on the status bar.\\n\\nSee it's there.\\nYou can switch it on as a running object snap.\\nClick away from the menu to lose the menu.\\nWe're going to go up to circle,\\nand we're going to go to center radius again like so\\nand come into the drawing area.\\nNow it's asking for the center point of the circle.\\nBefore you click on anything though,\\ndo a shift on the keyboard and a right click.\\nThis brings up your snap override,\\nyour object snap overrides.\\nAnd basically, you're overriding the running object snaps\\nthat you've set in the status bar.\\n\\nThere's geometric center.\\nSo I click on it,\\nand I just hover on the edge of the rectangle.\\nThere it is.\\nThere's the geometric center.\\nAs soon as you see that appear like that, just left click.\\nThe circle now is centered\\non the geometric center there, like so.\\nAnd again, you type in your 900,\\npress enter to confirm that radius, job done.\\nThat's how quick and easy it is to utilize object snaps\\nand AutoSnap effectively, and that geometric center snap\\nto create the same object in your AutoCAD drawings.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2029150\",\"duration\":408,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using POLAR and ORTHO for precise

So that's our additional angle.\\nNow bear in mind, it will not increment\\nto different increments of 67.\\n\\nThat is one individual additional angle set\\nin our polar tracking settings.\\nSo if I okay that now\\nand go to the line command on the draw panel,\\nthere's the line command, hover over\\nthat endpoint snap there and left click\\nand that is the first point of my line.\\nNow as I drag the mouse upwards to the right,\\nkeep an eye out, there's my polar tracking.\\nCan you see that? There's my 67 degrees.\\nCan you see that on the readout, on the dynamic input?\\nSo at the moment, that line\\nthat I've drawn from the initial first point,\\nis 1455,97 long.\\n\\nAnd it's going off at an angle\\nof 67 degrees from the zero line,\\nwhich is to the east zero.\\nRemember that default setting.\\nSo as you can see there, I can set individual angles\\nthat might be useful if I'm using specific angles\\nfor drafting, say a mechanical part\\nor perhaps a location in a geographical environment,\\nfor example.\\nI'm just going to hit escape there just to cancel that\\nthat because we don't actually need that line.\\nWhat I'm also going to do is go down\\nto polar tracking again, right click on it,\\nand go into tracking settings.\\n\\nThat 67 there isn't needed.\\nSo I can select it, right click on it and you'll see,\\nthere's no right click menu.\\nIt's right here. Delete.\\nYou'd think that you'd right click on that to delete it.\\nYou don't. You just delete it there like so.\\nOkay.\\nAnd that 67 is now removed from the polar tracking settings.\\nSo that's one way of creating our closed polyline.\\nLet's do that a slightly different way.\\nLet's use orthogonal.\\nNow orthogonal is a really weird word.\\nOrthogonal projection, it's basically working in vertical\\nand horizontal constraints.\\n\\nSo what we're going to do, we're going to select the rectangle,\\nright click and erase on the shortcut menu\\nand go down to the status bar.\\nThere's polar, I'm going to turn polar off\\nand I'm going to switch this one here.\\nIt looks like a right angle, ortho on.\\nNow you'll notice when I switch polar back on again,\\northo goes off, you cannot have them both running\\nat the same time.\\nSo if I click on ortho,\\npolar goes off anyway on the status bar.\\nNow this is another way of drawing things\\nand what it does is it constrains you to the X and Y axes.\\n\\nSo I'm now going to go up to my polyline command here, like so.\\nCome into the drawing area\\nand I'm going to pick a start point like I did before.\\nNow you'll notice, look, I move the mouse around.\\nI can only go horizontal and vertical with ortho.\\nSo I just drag along,\\nI type three, five, zero, zero\\nin the direct distance entry there.\\nThere's my line and I can just drag up vertically,\\ntwo, five, oh, oh, enter, drag to the left,\\nthree, five, oh, oh, enter,\\nand then it's a right click and close.\\n\\nThere we go.\\nAnd that is now still a closed polyline\\nof the same sizes that we did before.\\nOrtho is restrictive and it's deliberately restrictive\\n'cause it's tying you down to the X and y axes.\\nIf you want a bit more free hand,\\nturn the ortho off and put the polar tracking on\\nand use polar tracking to work\\nwith angle increments and individual angles.\\nDepends on what you're drawing,\\ndepends on what environment you're drawing in\\nand so on and so forth, but that's utilizing polar\\nand ortho to add geometry to your drawings.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4000203\",\"duration\":521,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating lines, arcs, and circles quickly and effectively\",\"fileName\":\"4261301_en_US_05_03_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":528,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"Please ensure that ALL references to AutoCAD Watt Beta are REMOVED/FADED in THIS chapter!

Job done.\\nYou've now placed the boundary of the landscaped area\\nthat's going to be worked on for people to have a break.\\nIt's going to be like a recreational area.\\nOkay, let's zoom out a bit, roll back on the wheel,\\npan across a bit,\\nand we're going to pan down to that table\\nthat we created in the previous video.\\n\\nThere we go. Pan and zoom.\\nGet that nicely placed in the center of the screen.\\nNow, before we do anything else,\\nlet's jump back to the right layer.\\nLayer drop again.\\nAnd you want this one here, A-700-M_FFE, not MH,\\njust M_FFE, that one there.\\nThen we're on the right layer to create the furniture again.\\nIt's a really good habit to get into to make sure\\nthat you select your layer before you start drafting.\\nSaves you having to go\\nand find objects later,\\nchange their layer properties, et cetera.\\n\\nOkay, we're going to take a look at drawing arcs now.\\nSo we're going to add an arc\\nto this right-hand vertical edge of the table.\\nSo we're going up to the Draw panel again.\\nThere's the Arc fly out\\nand you want Start, Center, End like so,\\nand we're going to start at this point here.\\nSo we're going to left-click on the end point,\\ngo to the midpoint snap there,\\nand then go to that end point there.\\nNow that is a perfect arc, isn't it?\\nBut what might happen is you might click in the wrong order.\\n\\nLet me just hit escape to cancel that arc command.\\nGo back to the Arc fly out on the Draw panel,\\nStart, Center, End.\\nNow let's say I start at the top.\\nEndpoint and midpoint and endpoint.\\nCan you see that?\\nInstead of going counterclockwise,\\nI've gone clockwise creating that particular arc.\\nSo that's the wrong way round.\\nSo all you do is what the undo is for\\nup here on the quick access toolbar.\\nClick on undo once you, lose the arc.\\nYou go back to the Arc, Start, Center, End\\non the Draw panel there and you start this way.\\n\\nEnd point there, left-click.\\nMidpoint there, left-click.\\nEndpoint there, left-click.\\nNow you'll notice,\\ncan you see on the command line at the bottom\\nof the screen there, hold Control to switch direction.\\nCan you see that?\\nIf I hold Control, I can hold down the Control key\\nand it'll switch the direction anyway,\\neven though I was going in the right direction.\\nSo that control key is incredibly useful\\nfor switching the direction of arcs if you need to.\\nSo I'll just undo that. Let's do it one more time.\\nStart, Center, End. So we'll start there.\\n\\nEndpoint snap, midpoint snap, endpoint snap.\\nSo that's one end of our table with an arc.\\nLet's do another arc on the other end.\\nNow I can just right-click and Repeat ARC,\\nbut that won't go back to the specific arc that I want.\\nIt will just start the default arc,\\nwhich is, when you look at the fly out,\\nthe 3-Point arc.\\nSo just be aware of that.\\nYou do need to go back up to the Draw panel\\nto get the Start, Center, End arc.\\n\\nNow this time we will start at the top,\\nendpoint snap there, and find the midpoint snap,\\nand down to the endpoint snap.\\nEasily done.\\nNow we've got a rectangle here that is still one object.\\nWe're going to go to the Modify panel\\nand use this command here.\\nExplode.\\nSo we click on Explode,\\nwe then select the rectangle, click on it,\\npress Enter to confirm.\\nDoesn't actually look any different, does it?\\nThat's because it is still a group of four individual lines.\\n\\nA polyline is a compound object made up\\nof a group of segments, line segments in this case.\\nWhat you've done is you've broken the compound polyline\\ninto its component parts, which are now four lines,\\nby exploding it.\\nCan you see that?\\nSo the two vertical lines, you can select those,\\nclick on each one.\\nRight-click, and on the shortcut menu, select Erase.\\nSo we've now got a nice table with rounded ends.\\nWhat we're going to do now is use some object snap tracking\\nto place a circular insert in the center of the table.\\n\\nSo we go up to the Draw panel again, Circle fly out,\\nand we go Center, Radius.\\nAnd we utilize our object snap tracking.\\nSo I hover over that midpoint there,\\nremember, don't click.\\nI then hover over that midpoint there.\\nRemember, don't click.\\nAs we drag the mouse downwards,\\nyou'll get the intersection of the two polar tracking lines\\ngoing through each midpoint, left-click.\\nThat is the center of your circle\\nand the radius of that is going to be 800.\\nPress Enter to confirm, job done.\\n\\nNow that's really useful, isn't it?\\nWe've used a bit of object snap tracking,\\na bit of exploding.\\nThat's created a really nice looking table.\\nNow what about a different type of circle?\\nLet's go up to the Circle fly out here\\nand select Center, Diameter.\\nSo this time we're going to place a center point\\nof our circle somewhere,\\nbut it'll have a diameter value that you put in.\\nI'm going to go over here to sort\\nof the top right corner of this grid square.\\nI'm going to click about there, left-click,\\nand then as you drag outwards,\\nkeep an eye on that prompt on the dynamic input.\\n\\nIt says specify diameter of circle 1600.00.\\nSo the default is 1600.00 diameter.\\nFunnily enough, the last circle we created in the center\\nof the bigger table had an 800.00 radius,\\nwhich would also give it a 1600.00 diameter.\\nLook down at the command line\\nand you can see there that you've got radius of circle,\\ndiameter of circle, it all tallies up.\\nSo AutoCAD has remembered the radius\\nof the last circle that you placed, 800.00,\\nand is now putting it into the diameter setting\\nand making it 1600.00.\\n\\nSo if you accept that default of 1600.00,\\nall you've got to do is click on the center point,\\npress enter to accept that default 1600.00.\\nAnd there you go.

[Instructor] Once again, we're staying\\nin our ground floor plan,\\nand in this particular video we're going to be taking a look at\\nhow we work with polylines and splines.\\nNow, we'll look at the spline function in a moment.\\nWhat we're going to look at first is generating a fully closed\\npolyline that contains line segments and arc segments.\\nNow in the previous video, we created our table here,\\ndidn't we, with the lines, the arcs, and the circle.\\nWhat I'd like you to do is erase all of this,\\nso just click on each arc.\\n\\nAs you can see, there's the arcs there, two lines,\\nand we also need to click on the circle,\\nall of that selected.\\nIt's then a right click\\nand on the shortcut menu, click on erase.\\nNow the reason I've done that is we're going to recreate\\nexactly what we've just erased,\\nbut only using the polyline and circle commands.\\nNow we're on the right layer already.\\nYou can see we're on our A700MFFE layer.\\nWe should still be on that from the previous video.\\n\\nWe're now going to go up to the draw panel\\non the home tab on the ribbon and click on polyline.\\nCome into the drawing area.\\nPick a point sort of there ish.\\nIt doesn't have to be exact, but about there,\\nand left click once.\\nUsing your polar tracking,\\nyou're going to drag to the right and type in 3500,\\nwhich was the length of the horizontal side of the table\\nwe've just erased.\\nPress Enter.\\nNow, that's the first segment of our polyline.\\n\\nRight click on the mouse.\\nBecause it's context sensitive,\\nyou're now working with functionality\\nin the polyline command\\nand you're going to select arc.\\nNow, you'll notice if you drag vertically downwards,\\nthe polar tracking kicks in.\\nI can then use direct distance entry\\nand type in 2500 in the box.\\nPress Enter to confirm,\\nand that places an arc\\nthat is basically diameter of 2500.\\n\\nHowever, we're still trying to draw an arc here,\\nso we right click again,\\nwe go to line on the shortcut menu,\\nand now we draw a line segment.\\nSo we drag to the left,\\nget the polar tracking to kick in,\\ndirect distance entry again, 3500 and Enter.\\nAnd there's our other line segment.\\nWe then right click again, go back to arc again,\\ndrag it up to the endpoint snap here.\\nWhen you see the endpoint snap,\\nleft click and then Enter to finish.\\n\\nJob done.\\nNow, you might think that by pressing Enter,\\nyou're out of the polyline command.\\nWell, all you've got to do there is right click,\\nand you'll notice that there's an Enter\\nat the top of the shortcut menu.\\nJust click on that, job done.\\nYou can press Enter on the keyboard if you want to.\\nIt's entirely up to you.\\nBoth ways work.\\nBut just make sure\\nthat you've come out of the polyline command\\nbefore you start moving around.\\nOtherwise, you'll start placing some weird arc\\nor line segments in place there and you don't want that.\\n\\nIf you hover over this now,\\nyou'll see it's a closed polyline.\\nVery quick and easy to do just utilizing that arc\\nand line setting in the polyline command.\\nWe now just go up to the circle command on the draw panel.\\nWe want center radius on the drop down there\\nand we do our auto snap, our object snap tracking.\\nHover over that midpoint there\\nand we hover over that midpoint there,\\ndrag downwards a little.\\nThere's the intersection.\\nLeft click, drag the circle out,\\nand it had a radius of 800.\\n\\nPress Enter to confirm.\\nAnd you've now got exactly the same table,\\nbut it's now a closed polyline and a circle.\\nOkay, zoom out slightly now\\nand pan around until we get to this area here\\nin the center of the drawing.\\nYou can see the stairs\\nand there's some sofas and tables and chairs here.\\nZoom into that central square\\nand you want to be looking at this wall over here.\\nSee the corner of the wall?\\nThat's kind of where you want to be.\\n\\nNow, don't worry about changing layers.\\nI'll show you a neat trick in a minute.\\nBut we're now going to look at the spline command.\\nNow, the spline command is on the hidden part\\nof the draw panel here.\\nSo we click on the arrow next to draw\\nand we click on the pin to pin that part of that panel open.\\nNow, you'll notice there's two types of splines.\\nWe have the spline with fit points.\\nWe have the spline with control vertices.\\nYou want the spline with fit points.\\nSo click on spline fit,\\ncome into the drawing area and zoom in a bit,\\nand you want to just click on\\nthat endpoint corner there of the wall.\\n\\nClick once and as you come around now,\\nI'll zoom out slightly so you can see what's going on.\\nJust click a few points, one,\\nand just come up and down.\\nYou're creating a nice wiggly wall\\nthat disguises the seating area\\nfrom the entrance area to the staircase.\\nWhen you get to about there, just press Enter to finish.\\nThere's your spline.\\nNow, it is a random spline,\\nbut a spline is an irregular curve in AutoCAD\\nand it is a non-uniform rational B-spline, NURBS,\\nN-U-R-B-S.\\n\\nYou'll often see it being mentioned\\nwhen you're working in 3D geometry\\n'cause splines are often used to create profiles\\nthat are then extruded in 3D geometry.\\nBut you can see there you've created in essence\\na wiggly wall to hide the chairs and the tables from,\\nif I zoom out slightly,\\nthe stair entrance area here.\\nNow, what we're going to do is we're going to offset that\\nto give it a thickness.\\nWe're going to zoom in on the corner of the wall right here.\\nGet your cross hair over it and zoom in nice and tight.\\nWe're going to go over to the utilities panel here\\non the home tab on the ribbon,\\nclick on the fly out for measure,\\nand select distance.\\n\\nClick on this endpoint of the corner here, left click,\\nand just drag vertically upwards until you see\\nthat intersection and left click again.\\nThe distance is 120.65.\\nRemember that distance and click on exit.\\nZoom out slightly so that you can see\\nall of your wiggly spline wall.\\nYou're then going to go up to the modify panel here\\non the home tab on the ribbon\\nand we're going to use this command here, offset.\\nClick on offset, come into the drawing area.\\n\\nIt asks for an offset distance.\\nThat's that 120.65 that I ask you to remember.\\nPress Enter to confirm the distance\\nand then click on your wiggly spline wall,\\nleft click on it,\\nand you can move either side.\\nCan you see the orange goes either side\\nof the selected purpley pink line?\\nYou want the orange below, not above.\\nCan you see that?\\nSo you want to offset downwards.\\nWhen the orange is below the original, left click,\\nand you've offset that by 120.65.\\n\\nPress Enter to finish the offset command.\\nGo up to the line command on the draw panel,\\nand you're going to draw a little line at the end.\\nSo endpoint there, left click,\\nto endpoint there, left click.\\nEnter to finish again\\nand then zoom in on this end of the wiggly spline wall.\\nCan you see there's the green wall there?\\nWe just need to extend that spline to the green wall.\\nSo we go to the modify panel, see where it says trim,\\nclick on the fly out, select extend.\\n\\nYou're just going to click on the end\\nof the line there to extend it.\\nCan you see it extends to the green wall?\\nPress Enter to finish.\\nYou've extended that neatly.\\nWe can now unpin the draw panel.\\nClick on the pin there.\\nThat will go back into the ribbon.\\nZoom out slightly and pan across.\\nThere is our wiggly spline wall,\\nbut it needs to be on this wall layer here.\\nSo we go up to match properties.\\nThat's on the properties panel\\non the home tab on the ribbon.\\nWe click on the source object,\\nwhich is our green wall line here,\\nand then a little paintbrush appears.\\n\\nClick on each of the splines.\\nThey go green.\\nClick on the little end line as well\\njust to make sure that it's all consistent.\\nEnter to finish.\\nAnd you've now placed a really neat,\\ncool looking wiggly spline wall.\\nWhen you zoom out, you can see it.\\nThat's really clever.\\nIt gives a nice feature as you come in\\nthrough the corridor down here to the stairs,\\nand then you come round into the relaxation area there.\\nSo as you can see,\\nwe've used the polyline command effectively\\nand we've used the spline command effectively.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"5.

[Instructor] We're starting a new chapter now,\\nand we're going to take a look at some other drafting tools\\nthat are available to you in your AutoCAD toolkit.\\nNow, when I say toolkit,\\nAutoCAD is a toolkit of many different commands\\nand features and functions\\nthat allow you to draft a model quickly,\\naccurately, and effectively.\\nSo we're going to be taking a deeper dive\\ninto the rectangle command,\\nand we're also going to take a look\\nat the polygon command as well.\\n\\nNow we've got a new drawing for you.\\nIt's very similar to the one\\nin the previous set of videos in the previous chapter.\\nThis time though it's called Ground Floor Plan_REV2.\\nThe REV2 stands for revision two,\\nso it might be the second iteration\\nof your ground floor plan, for example.\\nNow you'll notice there's some extra bits.\\nWe've got some nice shiny new tables and chairs and things,\\nbut you'll recognize this landscaped site area\\nthat we created in the previous chapter.\\n\\nWhat I'd like to do is zoom in on it\\nand get it nice and central on your screen like so.\\nThat's where we're going to be working\\nfor this particular video.\\nSo we're going to be taking a look at the rectangle command.\\nNow before we place the rectangle, just check your layer,\\nmake sure you're using the A-700_MFFE layer for furniture.\\nWe're then going to go up to the draw panel here,\\nhome tab on the ribbon, draw panel,\\nand click on this little fly out here and select rectangle.\\n\\nNow, one of the ways of placing a rectangle\\nis you can actually give it dimensions.\\nNow what we're going to do first though\\nis pick a corner point.\\nNow I need you to pick a corner point just up past the door\\nabout sort of, I'm going to go sort of there-ish.\\nAnd as you come away, can you see it's asking you now\\nfor the two sort of dimensions of the rectangle,\\nhorizontal, and vertical.\\nNow take a look at the command line\\nat the bottom of the screen.\\n\\nYou can also specify area dimensions and rotation.\\nIf you right click on the mouse,\\nthey're also on the shortcut menu.\\nI'd like you to select dimensions.\\nIt's now asking you for the length of your rectangle.\\nNow the length is, in essence, the horizontal X direction.\\nSo that's going to be 3500, Enter.\\nAnd then it'll ask for the width of your rectangle.\\nYou're going to make that 2000, and then Enter.\\n\\nSo there's your rectangle, 3,500 by 2000.\\nNow here's the clever bit.\\nYou can now rotate it around\\nthat original point that you clicked.\\nCan you see that I'm going around it in a circular motion?\\nJust moving my mouse around\\nin like a square sort of motion.\\nCan you see?\\nAnd you can pick a placement now for that rectangle.\\nSo you want the top right placement.\\nCan you see that?\\nTop left, top right, bottom right, bottom left.\\nYou want top right and you just left click.\\n\\nAnd there's your 3,500 by 2000 rectangle placed\\nusing this bottom left corner for placement.\\nSo that's just another way of placing a rectangle.\\nNow your rectangle, if you hover over it,\\nit'll tell you it is a polyline.\\nAny rectangle you place is a closed polyline.\\nNow go up to the draw panel,\\nclick on the fly out for circle there\\nand select center radius.\\nCome into the drawing area and pick a point over here,\\nsort of top right in the landscaped area,\\nleft click, drag the mouse out,\\nand you want to put in a radius of 2000,\\nlike that and press Enter.\\n\\nSo you've got a nice, big circle there.\\nNow this is going to be another piece of furniture\\nin the landscaped area.\\nNow we're going to utilize the circle as a guide\\nbecause we're going to place an octagonal eight-sided table\\nin that circle, or around that circle.\\nIt could be either.\\nSo we go back up to the draw panel,\\nclick on the fly out where rectangle is,\\nand you've got rectangle or polygon.\\nThis time, select polygon.\\n\\nCome into the drawing area\\nand it'll ask for the number of sides.\\nNow you can have the number of sides\\nfor a polygon goes from three up to 1024 in AutoCAD,\\nas far as I'm aware.\\nDon't quote me on the 1024, that may have changed,\\nbut when you're creating a polygon,\\nit's got to be at least three sides, hasn't it?\\nYou can't have two sides, that won't work.\\nIt's got to be three sides, a triangle.\\nWe want eight sides, an octagon.\\nSo we're going to type in eight\\nas our number of sides and press Enter.\\n\\nNow, it'll ask for the center of the polygon.\\nThis is where the circle comes in useful.\\nJust drift up to the circle and touch on it.\\nYour center snap should still be on on your object snaps.\\nYou don't have to go all the way\\ninto the center of the circle either.\\nWith that center appearing as it is now,\\nwith the crosshair touching the circle,\\nthe center snap is highlighted, just left click.\\nNow here's where you get asked two options.\\nDo you want your polygon inscribed\\ninside the edge of the circle\\nor circumscribed about the circle,\\ngoing around the outside edge of the circle?\\nI want it outside.\\n\\nSo I'm going to go circumscribed as in circumference,\\nand then I just drag vertically upwards.\\nCan you see there's my eight-sided table?\\nAs I come there, I get an intersection\\nwith the circumference of the circle, left click.\\nSo there you go, there's my octagon table.\\nNow we don't need circle anymore.\\nClick on the circle there.\\nMake sure you don't get the octagon.\\nAnd just right click and erase on the shortcut menu\\nand there's our eight-sided outdoor table\\nin our landscaped area.\\nSo that's a deeper dive into the rectangle command\\nand how to create a nice, simple circumscribed polygon.\\n\\nHave a play around maybe with the inscribed\\nand the circumscribed to see what they do,\\nbut it's always a good idea to create a circle first\\nand use the center of the circle\\nas the center of your polygon.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3997364\",\"duration\":632,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating points and donuts

Click again.\\nAnd there you go, moved it from one place\\nto another using the move command.\\n\\nNow, we do go into the move command later on,\\nbut that's just a quick use of the move command,\\nso that we've got some space over here.\\nNow, we're going to generate some bike bays\\nin this sort of landscaped area,\\nso that people can bring their bikes to work\\nand cycle to work.\\nSo we're going to go up to the layers panel on the home tab\\non the ribbon and click on layer properties.\\nNow, this opens up the layer properties manager.\\nNow, this is all the layers that are in our drawing\\nat the moment.\\nNow, what I am going to do is just hover over each\\nof these columns a little and just make them a bit bigger\\nfor you, so you can see what's going on.\\n\\nSo you can see there we've got things like on, freeze, lock.\\nWe've also got plot. We've also got color.\\nWe've also got line type.\\nSo you can see there that each\\nof these individual layers has got its own specific color\\nand line type.\\nYou can plot it, lock it, freeze it, turn it on and off.\\nNow, we need to create two new layers.\\nSo what we do is we go up here to this little icon.\\nCan you see the one with the little yellow star on it?\\nThat is your new layer.\\nClick on new layer, and you can see it's prompted me there\\nfor layer two.\\nThat's a default that it's put in there.\\n\\nSo the first one we're going to create is called Bike Bays.\\nLike that, you might obviously create\\na slightly more sophisticated layer name based\\non a standard like the ones that begin with A on the list,\\nbut we're just using Bike Bays for clarity right now.\\nPress enter to confirm the name.\\nClick on the little color box where it says white.\\nAnd we're going to select index color tab in the dialogue.\\nAnd we're going to come down here and go from magenta,\\nwhich is color six, that little color square there.\\nColor name magenta pops up, click on okay.\\n\\nSo there, Bike Bays, magenta.\\nKeep it as a continuous line type.\\nClick on the new layer icon again.\\nNotice it adopts the magenta color this time.\\nThis time the new layer will be Bike Bays\\nbut with an extra bit.\\nSo Bike Bays, dash,\\nand then SO, setting out, Points like so.\\nSo it's Bike Bays-SO, for setting out, Points.\\nPress enter to confirm.\\nSo we've got two new layers in our layer list.\\nNow, select Bike Bays-SO Points,\\nso you can just click on each layer name.\\n\\nCan you see and it highlights it?\\nYou want Bike Bays-SO Points. Hover over it and select it.\\nClick on that little green tick icon there,\\nmakes it the current drafting layer.\\nSo you can see their current layer, Bike Bays-SO Points.\\nClick on the cross there,\\nand the layer properties manager will close.\\nNow, we need to set a point style now\\nto place our setting out points for our bike bays.\\nSo we're going to go right over here to the right-hand side\\nof the home tab on the ribbon.\\n\\nAnd see where it says utilities?\\nClick on the fly out there,\\nand you can select point style.\\nClick on it. That will open up the point style dialogue.\\nNow, what we need to do is select a point style\\nthat stands out.\\nThe default, the one in black here, is a little dot,\\nwhich you won't notice any which way.\\nWe're going to select this one here.\\nCan you see the circle with the diagonal cross through it?\\nIt also looks very similar to the node object snap symbol.\\nAnd there's a reason for that. You'll see why in a minute.\\n\\nMake sure your point size is 5% set size relative to screen.\\nYou'll see why in a minute. Click on okay.\\nPoint style is now set.\\nNow, if we go up to the draw panel now and expand it out\\nand click on the pin, remember we did that last time?\\nAnd what we're going to look at is this one here.\\nMultiple points, so that we can place our setting out points\\nfor our bike bays.\\nSo I click on multiple points, come into the drawing area,\\nand it prompts me to specify a point placement\\non the dynamic input on the crosshair.\\n\\nNow, I can specify individual points\\nat random locations there, but what happens\\nif I want to be geometrically exact\\nwith this point placement?\\nLet's say I want 10 bike bays all neatly spaced\\ndown this vertical side of the landscaping.\\nThat would mean I'd have\\nto measure that line, divide it by 10, use a calculator,\\nand so on.\\nHit escape a couple of times to cancel the command.\\nLook over here on the draw panel. Can you see this one here?\\nIf I hover over it, I've got the option\\nto create evenly spaced point objects.\\n\\nI've also got the option to create point objects\\nat measured intervals.\\nYou want this one. You want divide.\\nWe're going to divide that line into 10 equal bike bays,\\nso we now click on divide.\\nWe come into the drawing area,\\nand it prompts me to select the object I want to divide.\\nSelect the vertical line. Click on it.\\nEnter the number of segments.\\nWe want 10 bike bays, so we type in 10,\\nand we just press enter.\\nAnd there's our point using our point style,\\nnice and neatly, on that vertical line.\\n\\nNow, what I'd like you to do is try something here.\\nZoom out by rolling back on your wheel on your mouse.\\nNotice the points there stay the same size.\\nJust type regen, R-E-G-E-N.\\nThat'll regenerate the drawing. Press enter.\\nNotice they resize to that 5% of screen size\\nthat we set in the point style.\\nIf I zoom back in again,\\nyou'll notice they stay big.\\nAgain, type regen, press enter, they go back to 5%.\\n\\nYou can also save the drawing.\\nThat will also regenerate the drawing as well if you need\\nto do it that way.\\nSo we've placed our setting out points now\\nfor our bike bays.\\nSo we need to change our layer.\\nGo up to the layer dropdown and select Bike Bays now.\\nAnd we're now going to draw a line from each of these points.\\nNow, these points are nodes.\\nSo see that's an AutoCAD point, it's an object?\\nSo we need to come down to our object snaps here\\non the status bar.\\n\\nSwitch node on like so. See the tick next to it?\\nClick in the drawing area to lose the menu.\\nWe're going to go up to the draw panel.\\nClick on line there like so.\\nAnd then, if we hover over that,\\ncan you see we get a node snap?\\nAnd look at the symbol for node, it's the same\\nas our point style.\\nJust kind of makes it easier to see, if you get what I mean.\\nClick on node. You're going to come out horizontally like that.\\nCan you see?\\nPolar tracking kicks in, and we're going to make each\\nof these bike bays four meters long.\\n\\nSo we're going to type in 4,000 millimeters, press enter,\\nand there's our bike bay there like so.\\nSo just press enter again. Job done.\\nSo there's our line. Can you see four meters long?\\nNow, all we've got to do now is select that line,\\nright click on there, go to copy selection\\non the shortcut menu.\\nAnd now, the base point is going to be on node.\\nWell, it'll be an endpoint on that line first, obviously.\\nLeft click on the endpoint snap,\\nand then just come down to each node.\\n\\nWhen it says node, click.\\nWork your way down,\\nand there's your bike bays going in nice and neatly.\\nAnd you've got 10 bike bays all equally the same width\\nbecause we used that tool up there\\nin the draw panel, the divide tool.\\nOnce you've done that, copy them, each one coming down.\\nJust press enter to close the copy command, job done.\\nNow, the really cool thing is\\nwe've used two different layers.\\nSo the bike bay lines are on the Bike Bays layer.\\n\\nThe setting out points are on the Bike Bays-SO Points layer.\\nNow, at the moment,\\nour Bike Bays are our current drafting layer.\\nIf I click on the fly out there and come down here\\nto Bike Bays-SO Points, don't click on that layer,\\njust click on the sun for the Bike Bays-SO Points layer.\\nAnd it freezes it. See the little snowflake?\\nIf I click on the snowflake again, they come back.\\nBut you click on the sun symbol,\\nmake sure the snowflake is displayed,\\nand you've frozen that layer,\\nso they don't always display on the drawing.\\n\\nJust hit escape a couple of times there just\\nto lose the layer dropdown menu.\\nDouble click on the wheel now.\\nThat'll zoom you to the extent of the visible drawn objects.\\nWe're going to go to the layer dropdown on the layers panel\\nand use the slider bar.\\nJust slide up to the top there,\\nand click on the zero default layer like so.\\nUsing pan and zoom, we're going to zoom in\\non the bottom left corner\\nof the building, just so we can see the intersection\\nof this grid line and this grid line.\\n\\nWe're then going to create a donut.\\nSo that's on the pinned draw panel here.\\nThere's the donut command right there.\\nCreates a fill circle or wide ring.\\nClick on it. Come into the drawing area.\\nInside diameter of the donut is going to be 250, enter.\\nOutside diameter 500, enter.\\nAnd can you see? There's our donut.\\nAnd it looks like a donut with a hole in the middle.\\nUsing the intersection of the two grids,\\nthere's the intersection snap there, left click,\\nthere's your donut.\\n\\nPress enter to finish.\\nYou've now got a setting out point highlighted\\nat the intersection of those two grid lines.\\nJust double click on the wheel to zoom to extent.\\nYou can see your little donut point there.\\nCan you see it there in the bottom corner?\\nAnd you can see all your setting out here\\nin your landscaped area as well.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3997363\",\"duration\":223,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating ellipses quickly and easily in AutoCAD\",\"fileName\":\"4261301_en_US_06_03_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":230,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"Please ensure that ALL references to AutoCAD Watt Beta are REMOVED/FADED in THIS chapter!

[Instructor] We're starting a new chapter now\\nwhere we're going to explore the AutoCAD interface\\na little bit further.\\nAnd when I say explore the AutoCAD interface,\\nwe're not going to be doing any drafting here.\\nThese are tools that are going to help you work\\nwith AutoCAD and your drawings rather than create geometry\\nor create objects in your drawings.\\nWe've got a new drawing for you.\\nIt's called Ground Floor Plan_REV3.dwg,\\nand you'll recognize it from previous videos\\nin previous chapters.\\n\\nNow, like I said, we're not going to do much drafting,\\nbut these are tools that will actually allow you\\nto navigate your drawing a bit quicker and a bit easier.\\nSo let's take a look at how these tools work.\\nWe're going to be taking a look at the file tabs\\nin AutoCAD first.\\nSo in this particular video, we're going to see\\nhow those file tabs work in your AutoCAD drawings.\\nNow there are lots of different tabs available.\\nNow you've obviously got your ribbon tabs up here at the top\\nof the screen, for example.\\n\\nNow I'm not talking about those kind of tabs.\\nIf you look just below the ribbon there,\\nyou can see your drawing tab there.\\nCan you see it says Ground Floor Plan_REV3?\\nNow, you will notice there's a little asterisk next\\nto the file name in the tab.\\nThat is letting you know\\nthat the drawing has been changed in some way\\nand needs to be saved.\\nSo if I now go up\\nto the save icon on the quick access toolbar\\nand click on save,\\nyou'll see that that little asterisk disappears.\\n\\nSo whenever you see that little asterisk,\\nit means you've made a change.\\nSo if I zoomed in, notice,\\nthe asterisk appears on the file tab.\\nIf I double click on the wheel there to zoom extents,\\nsave the drawing again, you'll see that asterisk disappears.\\nNow there is some other really cool functionality\\non that file tab.\\nNow I'm going to hover over the file tab, just my apologies\\nfor the long file names.\\nBut if I hover there, can you see there's the model,\\nthere's the ISO A1 Landscape layout tab,\\nand the Layout2 tab.\\n\\nCan you see them highlight at the bottom\\nof the screen as I move along?\\nThere's Model, ISO A1 Landscape, and Layout2.\\nYou've also got the ability there to plot\\nand also to publish your tabs as well.\\nIt's a very cool feature,\\nbut if you click on each of these, it takes you into each\\nof those spaces.\\nSo if I hover over the file tab, again, go to Layout2,\\nopens up Layout2.\\nHover again, go to Model,\\nand back in the Model space in the Model tab again.\\n\\nIt's a very useful way\\nof navigating around your drawing and in and out\\nof the different spaces within your drawing as well.\\nNow in later versions of AutoCAD,\\nyou've also got these little tabs up here.\\nNow, if I click here, you'll notice I can also go\\nto the start tab or any current drawings I've got open,\\nhover there, recognize that there's the model,\\nand obviously the ISO A1, the layout and so on.\\nSo I can go back there.\\nIf I click on it again though,\\nI can also create a new drawing.\\n\\nI can open a new drawing from a template,\\nopen an existing drawing,\\nsave all the drawings I've got open,\\nand close all the drawings I've got open,\\nwhich is incredibly useful if you've got more\\nthan one drawing open in an AutoCAD session.\\nSo there's a lot of tools in there\\nthat are incredibly helpful.\\nNow, if I come down to the bottom sort of corner,\\nbottom left corner, again, we've got the Model,\\nthe ISO A1 Landscape, and the Layout2.\\nI can click on those quite happily\\nback to the model tab there.\\n\\nBut I've got another little set of tabs here as well.\\nIf I click here, you'll notice I can create a new layout,\\na new layout from a template.\\nI can open up the Page Setup Manager.\\nI can select all my layouts like so there's only two,\\nbut see, they're highlighted now?\\nAnd that means now that I can now publish\\nthose selected layouts if I want to,\\ndoing a batch plot in AutoCAD.\\nI can also dock this above the status bar.\\nSo if I click there, can you see I've got the tabs now?\\nThey're above the status bar, which allows me\\nto extend more functionality onto the status bar if I want\\nto, and also have more layout tabs going\\nalong over the status bar.\\n\\nSo if I click there and put that in line\\nwith the status bar, again, it drops back down again.\\nThey're just little sort of navigational tools that allow me\\nto work with my interface in AutoCAD.\\nAnd again, I can click there, notice I can go into each\\nof the tabs if I want to like that, and back to Model again.\\nSo there's all these ways\\nand means of navigating around all the spaces\\nand the areas that you need to work in your AutoCAD drawings\\nand in later versions of AutoCAD\\nand this particular version of AutoCAD, AutoCAD 2026,\\nyou can see that those new tabs are really useful\\nfor navigating around as well.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3995316\",\"duration\":281,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Utilizing the AutoCAD shortcut

click on the mouse.\\nNow I'm going to take you through it,\\nand I'm going to zoom in on this area of the drawing.\\nCan you see where these doors are?\\nThere's a little bit of space there.\\nI'm going to work in that space there.\\nAnd what I'm going to do is just make sure\\nthat we're on the layer zero.\\nSo there's layer zero, top of the list of the layers there,\\nand we're going to draw some lines,\\nand I'm going to show you how the right click menu works.\\n\\nNow the actual name for the right click menu\\nis right click mouse button context sensitive shortcut menu.\\nSo you can probably guess why I just call it\\nthe shortcut menu, right?\\nSo it is just the shortcut menu\\nor sometimes known as the right click menu.\\nNow, what I'm going to do\\nis go to the draw panel on the home tab on the ribbon,\\nand click on the line command.\\nI'm going to come into the drawing area here,\\nand I'm just going to draw a random line.\\nI'm going to click once, drag upwards, click again.\\nSo there's my line segment that I've drawn.\\nNow I can draw as many line segments as I want,\\nso I can come along here, use a bit of polar tracking,\\ncome down a bit, use a bit of polar tracking,\\nand I'm going to come over here now.\\n\\nBut what I'm going to do for this line segment\\nis I'm going to right click.\\nAnd you'll notice the shortcut menu looks different,\\nand it is because it's context sensitive right now.\\nIt's context sensitive to the line command\\nthat I'm working in.\\nBut I can also go into Osnap override\\nand select something like mid between two points,\\nwhich is a snap that you don't normally get\\non a regular Osnap menu.\\nSo I go mid between two points,\\nand I want to go between that point of the doorway\\nand that point of the doorway.\\n\\nTwo end points.\\nCan you see it's gone to the mid between two points like so,\\nand then I can come down here, click again,\\nclick again, click again.\\nNow, it may be that you've messed up\\none of your line segments.\\nSo what I can do now is I can right click\\nand undo within the line command,\\nand that undoes each line segment.\\nSo can you see that, I'm just right clicking each time\\nand selecting undo.\\nThere we go.\\nSelecting undo again, right click,\\nand I'm all the way back to where I was before.\\n\\nNow, don't draw all your line segments.\\nPress enter to close the line command and then undo,\\nbecause if you do that,\\nit'll basically cancel out your last line command\\nand get rid of all of your line segments.\\nIf you make a mistake within the line command,\\nit's a right click and undo,\\nand it undoes that last line segment.\\nSo what I can do now is I can just right click,\\nselect enter, and there you go.\\nThat's the equivalent of pressing the enter key\\non the shortcut menu as well.\\n\\nSo that's left us with our original first line segment.\\nNow, without anything selected, I can also right click\\nand that'll bring up the default shortcut menu.\\nSo you can see there, I can repeat the line command,\\nI can repeat recent input.\\nSo there's the recent commands that I've used.\\nI can use the clipboard.\\nI can also use the isolate tools, which we'll cover later.\\nBut there's all these different tools available,\\nlike the calculator, counting objects in your drawing,\\nfinding objects in your drawing,\\nand that's all on the default right click with no commands\\nor any objects selected.\\n\\nNow, if I select my line like that,\\nand then right click, again, it looks different\\nbecause now I've still got the repeat line\\nrepeat input, et cetera.\\nBut I've got tools that I can use with my object.\\nI can erase it, I can move it, I can copy it,\\nI can add selected objects, I can select similar

properties pallet, for example.\\n\\nSo there's all these different tools\\nthat are context sensitive,\\ndepending on what you're doing\\nwhen you right click on your mouse\\nto bring up that

It's called officelayout.dwg.\\n\\nYou know the drill by now.\\nDownload it from the library to follow along\\nwith the videos in this chapter,\\nand there'll be a number of little iterations\\nof this drawing as we work through this chapter.\\nAs we build up and develop the office layout,\\nyou'll see that there's some revisions of the drawing\\nas we go through.\\nI'll explain which DWG file you need\\nfor which video in this particular chapter.\\nNow, as you can see,\\nit's a very simple little office layout.\\nWe've got a little door there with some walls\\nand some partitions.\\n\\nAnd on the right hand side, we've got some furniture,\\ngot a nice pot plant, we've got a little red computer\\nand a little green chair.\\nNow we need to work out how we select those objects.\\nNow, by default, the quickest way\\nto select those objects is just take the crosshair\\nover an object.\\nYou'll see it highlights, like so.\\nYou left click on it, it is now selected.\\nNow the reason you know it's selected is,\\nit's gone a pale blue color\\nand the little blue square,\\nthe grip, has appeared on the object.\\n\\nNow that object only has the one grip\\nbecause it is an AutoCAD block.\\nIt's a group of lines that have been converted to a block\\nto represent a desk.\\nSo you can see how that works.\\nNow if you want to deselect that object,\\njust press escape once.\\nYou'll see it deselects.\\nNow, if you've got that object selected during a command\\nand you want to cancel, you press escape twice,\\nonce to deselect the object,\\nsecond time to cancel the command.\\nSo it's escape twice.\\n\\nGet into the habit of hitting escape twice,\\nbecause sometimes you can still be in a command\\nthat you might not want to be in as well.\\nNow, selecting one object is easy,\\nso I'll click on the desk again.\\nNow, the good thing is the default settings\\nin AutoCAD allow you to go and select multiple objects\\nand put them into what is known as a selection set.\\nSo I've clicked on each of those objects,\\nthey've all gone that pale blue,\\nand you can see the grips on them like so.\\nSo that is now known as a selection set.\\n\\nIf I want to remove something from the selection set,\\nI'll hold down the shift key on the keyboard,\\nhover over a selected object.\\nYou'll see the little minor sign appear there.\\nClick on that desk. Can you see?\\nIt's now deselected.\\nHold down shift again.\\nClick on the chair, minus sign there,\\nclick on it, deselect it.\\nIf I click on it again without the shift,\\nadds it back to the selection set again.\\nI'll just hit escape there a couple of times,\\njust to deselect everything.\\nNow, there will be occasions where you want\\nto select more than one object.\\n\\nQuickest way to do this, get the crosshair, say over there,\\nleft click once on the mouse and release the mouse button.\\nDrag the blue window over all\\nof the objects that you want to select.\\nCan you see, I've encompassed all of them\\nin the blue window?\\nLeft click and release again.\\nAnd you'll see that that selection has selected all\\nof those objects.\\nThat's known as a window selection,\\ngoing normally from left to right.\\nHit escape a couple of times to deselect.\\n\\nI'm going to put the crosshair down here now.\\nBottom right, I'm going to left click\\nand release the mouse button.\\nI'm just going to drag it upwards.\\nYou'll see it's green and dashed this time,\\nbut I'm just going to go through the computer,\\nthe pot plant and the desk.\\nI'm not going to encompass them completely.\\nThen I'm going to left click again.\\nCan you see they're all selected again?\\nThat's known as a crossing selection,\\nand that normally goes from right to left.\\nAnd a crossing selection will select all\\nof the objects encompassed by the green dash window,\\nas well as any objects that are crossed\\nby that green dash window.\\n\\nSo two useful methods there of selecting objects.\\nI'll just hit escape a couple of times again.\\nNow we're going to go and look at our AutoCAD options.\\nSo make sure that you've got no commands running,\\nno selection, et cetera.\\nI'm going to right click\\nand on the shortcut menu, go down to options.\\nNow the option dialogue box will appear.\\nClick on the selection tab\\nand you'll see that all of your settings\\nfor selecting objects are in here.\\nNow, there's one particular one\\nthat I want you to be aware of.\\n\\nIt's allow press and drag for lasso there.\\nNow, we will look at that in a second,\\nbut make sure it's ticked.\\nIt is normally ticked by default,\\nand I'll show you how it works.\\nThe other one that's really important\\nto make sure is ticked is your noun verb selection.\\nThat allows you to select objects\\nand then select the command.\\nSo you select the objects and go,\\n\\\"I want to move those objects,\\\"\\nor, \\\"I want to copy those objects,\\\"\\nand we'll get into that later on in the chapter.\\nSo just make sure that noun verb selection is ticked\\nand your lasso box is ticked as well.\\n\\nClick on okay.\\nNow let's take a look at our lasso tool.\\nNow this is a click and a hold on the mouse button.\\nAnd can you see, if I go from left to right like that,\\nonly the objects encompassed\\nby the blue lasso when I release will be selected.\\nHit escape a couple of times.\\nIf I go from right to left, can you see?\\nI'm going that way, that way.\\nSo I went the wrong way there\\nand it's done a blue one again, and it gets a bit weird\\n'cause if you move the mouse around like that,\\nit all goes a little bit crazy.\\n\\nJust release the mouse button, hit escape a couple of times.\\nNow if you're going to go from right to left,\\nyou need to say, click up here,\\nand you need to go the opposite way to the way\\nthat you think, like that.\\nCan you see?\\nI've just clicked and released the mouse button.\\nI've got a selection window going on.\\nSo it's a click and a hold. Now this is the weird one.\\nI take the lasso through,\\ngo in the opposite direction from right to left,\\nand as I go through each one,\\nI can create a really weird shape.\\nThere we go.\\nRelease the mouse button,\\nand they're all selected because it's a crossing lasso,\\nrather than a window lasso.\\n\\nDo you see what I mean? Blue and green.\\nRemember the blue and the green.\\nSo there's some really cool methods there of selecting\\nand deselecting and lassoing\\nand windowing objects to make sure that you select them\\nwhen you modify your objects quickly and easily.\\nHit escape a couple of times just to deselect,\\nand we'll move on to the next video where we start\\nto cover more of the modify tools in AutoCAD.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2027355\",\"duration\":259,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using Move and Copy in your AutoCAD drawings\",\"fileName\":\"4261301_en_US_08_02_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":267,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"Please ensure that ALL references to AutoCAD Watt Beta are REMOVED/FADED in THIS chapter!

[Shaun] We're staying in our officelayout.dwg file,\\nand we're going to take a look now\\nat how we can quickly use Rotate and Scale\\nto tidy up our office layout.\\nNow, in the previous video,\\nwe did a bit of moving and copying,\\nand you can see we've got some objects now\\nin our office space.\\nLook at this cubicle here, we're going to zoom in,\\nand get that nice and central on the screen\\nso that we can see what we're doing.\\nNow, you'll notice that the chair and the computer\\naren't really oriented correctly to the desk,\\nso we need to rotate them.\\n\\nNow, before we do anything,\\npop down to your status bar.\\nYou want to go to your polar tracking here\\nand click on the little flyout arrow,\\nand select 45 degree angle increments, that one there.\\nNow, the reason I suggest that is if you look at this desk,\\nit's got that 45-degree angle increment\\nin the central section.\\nSo ideally, we want the chair and the computer\\nrotated to align with that 45-degree line.\\nAnd if we've got polar tracking set to 45 degrees,\\nit's going to make our lives a lot easier.\\n\\nSo select the computer, click on it,\\nand like we did before, once you've selected it,\\nright click, and go to Rotate, like so.\\nNow, I'll ask for a base point,\\na lot of the Modify tools do.\\nI'm going to use that little midpoint snap there\\nin the center of the computer monitor, and left click.\\nNow, as I rotate my mouse around in a circular motion,\\ncan you see each of the polar tracking lines kicks in?\\nAnd I get a 45-degree angle line kicking off that way.\\nOne of the increments of 45 degrees is 135 degrees.\\n\\nAs soon as you see that polar tracking kick in,\\njust make sure you stay on the tracking line,\\nand left click.\\nThere you go, rotated quickly and easily.\\nNow, you can rotate by typing in an angle value.\\nAll you've got to do is remember\\nthat counterclockwise by default in AutoCAD\\nis a positive angle value,\\ngoing clockwise normally\\nis a negative angle value by default in AutoCAD.\\nBut I've got polar tracking,\\nso I don't need to think about that.\\nSo I select the chair, like so,\\nand again, right click and rotate.\\n\\nNow, what I would do here is just pick a point randomly\\nin the center of the chair, and left click.\\nAnd as you rotate round in a circle,\\ncan you see you get each increment of 45 degrees?\\nSo as you come down this way,\\nyou got 315 degrees on the polar tracking there,\\nleft click, job done.\\nNow, the chair's a bit too far away from the desk.\\nClick on the chair, just click on that grip there,\\nand just move it a little bit, you can move it freehand.\\nJust get it roughly towards the desk a bit\\nand left click again.\\n\\nHit Escape to deselect it.\\nNow, it looks neat and tidy.\\nNow, somebody can sit in that chair and face the computer.\\nNow, zoom out slightly.\\nWe've got our great big pot plant here.\\nNow, a lot of these big pot plants are used as privacy\\nin an office cubicle environment,\\nand you can see why that pop plant\\ngives you a bit of privacy with your desk there.\\nBut wouldn't it be nice\\nto have a bit of greenery sitting there\\non this part of the desk here perhaps?\\nSo let's take a look at how we do that.\\nWe're going to select the pot plant first,\\nand then it's a case of right click, and Copy Selection.\\n\\nNow, the base point will be that intersection\\nthat we used previously when we did the move and the copy.\\nSo as you can see there, I'm copying that.\\nNow, before we copy it, just pop down to your status bar.\\nAnd as you do so, you'll see the plant stops moving,\\nyou want to make sure that this is on.\\nYou want your auto snap, your object snap tracking,\\nor make sure it's on.\\nAs you come back into the drawing,\\nyou pick up the plant again.\\nHover over the midpoint there,\\nsee the midpoint snap there on that edge of the desk?\\nAnd then hover over the midpoint\\nof this section of the desk here.\\n\\nAs you drag to the left,\\nyou'll see the intersection of the two tracking lines,\\njust left click and then Enter to finish the copy command.\\nSo we've copied our plant onto the desk.\\nIt's a bit big for the desk though, isn't it,\\nit's trying to grow into the wall.\\nSo we select the pot plant, and we right click,\\nand again, on the shortcut menu,\\nScale is there as well, so we click on Scale.\\nScale is also available on the Modify panel\\nif you want to go down that route.\\nSo I'm going to go here\\nto my little intersection in the middle again.\\n\\nThere it is there, I use that as the base point,\\nand left click.\\nAnd then as I move in and out,\\ncan you see I'm making it bigger and smaller.\\nNow the scale factor that we want,\\nwe want it to be a little bit smaller than the original,\\nso we're going to go for 0.6,\\nit's going to be 60% of its original size.\\nPress Enter, and it sits nicely on the desk.\\nSo not only have we got our privacy plant,\\nbut we've got our little pot plant on our desk as well.\\nNow, just pan upwards a tiny bit\\nso that everything is central on the screen.\\nSelect your newly rotated chair and computer,\\nand select your newly scaled desk plant, like that.\\n\\nRight click, and go to Copy selection.\\nNow, this time, we're going to select a common base point.\\nIt's going to be this corner of the desk here,\\nsee that endpoint snap?\\nLeft click, and then drag it to this desk,\\nsame endpoint snap there, left click.\\nEnter to finish, and you've copied everything over.\\nHow quick is that?\\nI don't have to do it over and over again.\\nI can do my rotate, my copy, my scale,\\nand then I just copy everything I've just worked on,\\nand drop it onto another desk.\\n\\nThat's the benefit of AutoCAD.\\nImagine having to do that\\non a drawing board 20 odd years ago.\\nNow, that's where I started off with AutoCAD many years ago,\\nand I've been using AutoCAD for 36 years this year.\\nAnd little tools like move, copy, rotate, and scale\\nstill make me smile now\\nbecause of the amount of time I know they're saving me,\\nthe productivity that they're giving me\\nwhen I'm working in my AutoCAD

also OFFSET.\\nNow you will find\\nthat both of these commands are not available\\non the right-click shortcut menu.\\nSo you do have to use the Modify panel\\non the Home tab on the ribbon.\\nHowever, it's not a hardship.\\nIt's just a workflow that we need to use.\\n\\nNow we're going to take a look at the MIRROR command first.\\nNow you'll remember this cubicle up here\\nthat we set up sort of top center of the office space.\\nWhat we're going to do,\\nwe're going to mirror that desk arrangement\\ninto the right-hand cubicle here,\\nbut we're going to hand it so it's the opposite hand,\\nso it's kind of left-handed/right-handed.\\nSo we need to select the objects\\nthat we're going to mirror first.\\nAnd this is utilizing that Noun/Verb Selection box\\nthat I suggested that you have ticked\\nin your Options in AutoCAD.\\n\\nSo we select our desk plant, our desk,\\nour computer, and our chair.\\nJust click on each one.\\nWe then go up to the Modify panel here,\\nand there's Mirror right there.\\nWe click on Mirror.\\nCome into the drawing area.\\nNow it asks for the first point of your mirror line.\\nNow this is where Object Snaps must be on,\\nand you also need to be really accurate\\nwith your Object Snaps.\\nCan you see this little partition wall\\nbetween the cubicles?\\nYou want the midpoint snap right there,\\nthe little midpoint snap\\non the end of the partition wall, left-click.\\n\\nAs you drag vertically upwards,\\nyou'll see a preview of your mirrored objects\\nand you want to make sure\\nthat you go vertically up the tracking line just to there.\\nSee the top of the screen there?\\nIt should have 90 degrees.\\nIf it's got 90 degrees, left-click.\\nYou will then be prompted,\\n\\\"Do you want to erase the source objects\\nthat you're mirroring?\\\"\\nAnd in this case, that's a no.\\nSo just click on No,\\nand now they're mirrored beautifully\\ninto the right-hand cubicle.\\nSo you've now set up two really nice cubicles\\nin your office space.\\n\\nNow something I have noticed there\\nis our little privacy plant is now a bit off-center.\\nSo select that, click on the grip in the middle.\\nYou might want to try and just pop that more central there.\\nLittle bit of CAD manager OCD there for you.\\nI'll just hit Escape a couple of times\\njust to deselect the potted plant.\\nNow that's one way of mirroring.\\nNow down here,\\nwe've got no way of getting into our cubicle.\\nWe're going to have to hurdle the desk to get to the chair.\\nSo ideally, we want to mirror\\nall of this little setup here in this cubicle.\\n\\nSame selection process,\\ndesk plant, desk, computer, chair, like so.\\nNow the good thing\\nis because we've used the MIRROR command once,\\nI can now right-click,\\nand I can Repeat MIRROR there,\\nor I can go to Recent Input, MIRROR is there as well.\\nDoesn't matter which one you select,\\nbut you want the first point of your mirror line.\\nNow I'm going to cheat here\\nbecause I know that these vertical lines here\\nand this horizontal line here are along the middle\\nof that square of that cubicle space.\\n\\nSo I'm going to go endpoint there, left-click,\\nfirst point of my mirror line,\\ncome down to the endpoint there,\\nleft-click again for the second point of my mirror line.\\nNow it'll ask me,\\n\\\"Do I want to erase the source objects?\\\"\\nNow it looks a bit busy there,\\nand you want say, \\\"Yes please.\\\"\\nAnd as you can see, it's mirrored it,\\nbut the original objects have been erased.\\nSo now no more hurdling of the desk needed\\nto get to the chair and the computer and so on.\\nReally useful, isn't it, the MIRROR Command?\\nIt makes life a lot easier.\\n\\nNow here's a trick for you.\\nGo to the Home tab on the ribbon,\\npop over to the Utilities panel here,\\nand click on the Measure flyout.\\nSelect Quick, and as you move around now,\\nit gives you all of these distances,\\nso you can quickly check the thickness of a wall\\nor a distance from one wall to another.\\nHover over the outside wall,\\nand you can see that the thickness of the wall there is 150.\\nThat's 250 millimeters.\\nCommit that to memory\\nand then just hit Escape a couple of times\\nto cancel Quick Measure.\\n\\nWhat we're going to do is go to the Layers panel here,\\nclick on the Layer dropdown,\\nand make sure that we're using the Walls layer\\nas the current layer, which we are.\\nPan across slightly,\\nand we're going to draw some lines.\\nSo we go to the Draw panel, hit the Line command there\\nand we're going to use this endpoint corner here\\nand left-click.\\nDrag to the left,\\nand utilizing your polar tracking there.\\nIt should be at 180 degrees,\\ntype in 2400, 2,400.\\n\\nIt's metric millimeters, so that's 2.4 meters.\\nPress Enter, and there's our first line,\\nvertically downwards using polar tracking.\\nThat's at 270 degrees, same distance, 2,400,\\nand then press Enter again.\\nNow those are the two lines that you need at the moment,\\nso just press Enter to finish the LINE command.\\nWe're now going to use that 150 measurement,\\nbut we're going to use Offset.\\nSo we go up to the Modify panel.\\nThere's the Offset command there.\\nIt looks like a sort of flat capital C.\\n\\nSo click on Offset and come into the drawing area.\\nWe're going to specify an offset distance of our

me\\nthat they're on the Walls layer.\\nThey shouldn't be, they should be on the Doors layer.\\nSo, click on the Layer dropdown, click on Doors here,\\nhit Escape a couple of times,\\nand you'll see they're now on the appropriate layer.\\n\\nYou can hover over the arc there.\\nIt tells you it's on the Doors layer.\\nHover over the line there,\\nit also tells you it's on the Doors layer.\\nNow the other thing we need to do\\nis we need to revisit our cubicle and furniture\\nand bits over here.\\nNow, we don't want this desk here,\\nbut what we do want is we want this furniture\\nand the desk plant to go up to this desk here.\\nSo, we're going to use the Mirror command.\\nSo, we select the computer, the chair, and the desk plant.\\nThat's all we need.\\nWe go up to the Mirror command\\non the Modify panel, like we've done previously.\\n\\nAnd again, be accurate with your object snaps.\\nYou want the midpoint snap there.\\nThat midpoint on the partition wall, left-click,\\ndrag to the left, and keep.\\nCan you see that?\\nYou want to keep your polar tracking kicking in, like that,\\nleft-click on the polar tracking line.\\nErase the source objects?\\nYes, please.\\nSo, you can see they've mirrored up here\\nto what is now, in essence, kind of, an executive office.\\nThis desk here isn't needed.\\nSo, we can select it, right-click,\\nselect Erase on the shortcut menu.\\n\\nAnd you'll notice that we're using the desk\\nthat we smart placed earlier using the AI in AutoCAD.\\nNow, we've got a big pot plant here\\nthat is kind of sitting in space.\\nYou might want to click on it,\\nclick on the grip in the center,\\njust pop it up there into that nice executive office\\nand left-click.\\nAnd then just hit Escape a couple of times to deselect.\\nSo you can see now,\\nwe've done a nice little bit of housekeeping.\\nNow, if we just hover over the hatching\\ninside the walls here.\\nCan you see?\\nThere's the hatch.\\n\\nIt's on the layer Walls.\\ncan you see It'll go into the Hatch Editor.\\nDon't worry about that.\\nWe'll cover that later.\\nGo back to the Home tab on the ribbon\\nand you can see that the Walls layer is current.\\nClick on the flyout again,\\nand this time, you want to put it onto the Hatching layer.\\nClick on Hatching.\\nAnd just hit Escape a couple of times, like so.\\nAnd can you see, it changes color.\\nSo, it distinguishes the hatching a bit more in the drawing.\\nRoll back on the mouse wheel a couple of notches,\\nor maybe just one, like I have,\\nand just click on that hatching again.\\n\\nAnd you'll see that you've got a central grip, like so.\\nClick on that grip and just drag the hatching\\noutside of the building, like that.\\nWe'll sort that out later.\\nJust left-click about there.\\nYou'll see that it's a separate hatch all on its own.\\nHit Escape a couple of times, like that.\\nAnd you can see now, if you zoom out slightly,\\nthere's your hatching, but there's your office build there.\\nNow, we're going to zoom in\\non the lower part of the building\\nso that we can see the door on the horizontal wall.\\n\\nNow, we want the door\\nover on the left hand side of the building.\\nSo, again,\\nwe're going to utilize our mirror command.\\nSo, select the arc and the line,\\nbut also these two smaller lines\\nthat form the opening in the wall.\\nClick on those.\\nYou can right-click now, Recent Input, Mirror.\\nIt's asking for the first point of your mirror line.\\nNow, you want the middle of the wall,\\nnot the middle of this bit of wall\\nwhere there's a hole in it.\\n\\nSo, we want the whole length of the wall.\\nSo, what we do is we do a Shift and a right-click.\\nAnd on the shortcut menu now,\\nwe have our object snap overrides.\\nYou want Mid Between 2 Points.\\nYou're going to go from this corner here,\\nendpoint snap left-click,\\nto this corner here, endpoint snap left-click.\\nAnd then as you move vertically up the polar tracking line,\\ncan you see, it's mirroring the door to the left-hand side.\\nSo, go vertically up the polar tracking line,\\nleft-click somewhere on the polar tracking line.\\n\\nErase source objects?\\nYes.\\nNow, that does leave some gaps here,\\nwhich we're going to rectify in a second,\\nbut it also means\\nthat we've got to trim the wall down here somehow.\\nAnd I'll show you how to do that too.\\nLet's close the holes over here on the right-hand side.\\nGo up to the Modify panel, click on the little flyout arrow,\\nand click on the pin to pin the panel open.\\nNow you'll see here,\\nthere's what looks like two arrow heads\\npushing up against each other.\\nThat is the Join command.\\n\\nClick on Join, come into the drawing area,\\nyou need to select this line and this line.\\nPress Enter to finish.\\nJob done.

[Instructor] Once again,\\nwe're staying in our Office Layout.dwg file.\\nAnd I'm going to take you through\\na little bit of grip editing in a moment,\\nbut we do need to do a little bit of housekeeping.\\nYou'll notice the hatch for our walls\\nis still sitting outside of our walls at the moment,\\nso we want to tidy that up\\nand make that look neater in the drawing first.\\nSo let's go to our Layer dropdown.\\nSo we go to the Layers panel, Layer dropdown,\\njust make sure we're on the Hatching layer for the moment.\\n\\nJust make sure it's a bit of a coverall\\nto make sure that everything goes onto the Hatching layer\\nwhen we're working with the hatch command.\\nNow what we do need to do\\nis we need to get that hatch back inside the wall lines.\\nSo what we do is we go to the Draw panel\\non the Home tab on the ribbon,\\nand we click on the fly out here like so.\\nThere's the hatch command.\\nAnd as you can see,\\nit's asking us to pick an internal point.\\nYou'll also notice we've gone\\nto the contextual Hatch Creation tab\\nthat we talked about earlier.\\n\\nSo now this time, we are going to use some of the tools\\non that Hatch Creation tab.\\nNow what we need to do is match properties.\\nSo we're going to go to the Options panel here,\\nand you see we've got Match Properties there.\\nIf I click on the flyout,\\nwe can use the current origin\\nor use the source hatch origin.\\nIt doesn't matter which one you use.\\nI would use the current origin at the moment.\\nAnd we're going to click on Match Properties here like so.\\nAnd what we do is we select the hatch object\\nthat we want to take the properties from.\\n\\nSo we put the pick box over it and left click,\\nand you'll see there now that we're prompted\\nto pick an internal point\\nwhere we're going to match those hatch properties.\\nSo if you come in now and hover inside the wall lines,\\ncan you see you get a little preview there of your hatch,\\nleft click, and that hatch has now been placed.\\nNotice you can carry on hatching\\nand make the whole drawing look really weird if you want to.\\nYou don't want to do that.\\nClose hatch creation up here,\\nclick on the green tick, job done.\\nThis hatching is now surplus to requirements,\\nwe click on it, right click,\\nErase on the shortcut menu.\\n\\nSo now everything's tidied up.\\nDon't worry about that little popup\\nthat just appeared top right,\\nthat was talking about hatch patterns\\nwith non-associative boundaries and so on.\\nYou don't need to worry about that.\\nAnd as you can see, it just fades back away\\ninto AutoCAD after a little while anyway.\\nSo we were talking about grips.\\nHow do we do some grip editing?\\nWell, what we're going to do,\\nwe're going to select this chair,\\nthis desk, this computer, this plant.\\nWe're then going to right click and Erase them.\\n\\nNow what we're going to do\\nis we're going to use grips to mirror them over here.\\nWe're going use the Mirror tool from the Grip Editing tools\\nto do what we did previously with the mirror earlier.\\nSo if we zoom in a bit so that we can see what we're doing,\\nand get in nice and tight when you're zooming in and out,\\nit's so much easier to zoom in\\nand see the detail in your AutoCAD drawings.\\nUse that zoom and pan to your advantage.\\nSo now we're going to select our desk plant,\\nour desk, our computer, and our chair.\\n\\nNow all of those you'll notice have got grips,\\nthose little blue squares.\\nNow those grips are really important\\nbecause if I select one of those grips and click on it,\\nlike this one up here,\\ncan you see on the top corner of the desk?\\nIt goes a red color.\\nIf I left click on it,\\nit then becomes what they call a hot grip,\\nit goes a dark red.\\nAnd you'll notice now,\\nI can start moving that desk around using that grip,\\nbut I can also work with other tools.\\nIf I right click now,\\nthese are my grip editing tools.\\n\\nNow what we want to do is we want to do a mirror.\\nSo if I click on Mirror now,\\ncan you see it's mirroring all of the selected objects,\\nbut from that little red grip,\\nwhich is not quite where we want to mirror from.\\nSo instead of specifying the second point\\nof the mirror line there,\\nwhat I do is I right click\\nand I go to Base Point.\\nNow it asks for a base point to mirror from.\\nSo I'm going to the little midpoint snap,\\nremember there on the partition wall,\\nget that midpoint snap.\\n\\nAnd as you drag vertically upwards now,\\ncan you see it's working in exactly the same way\\nas it would when you\\nwere mirroring with the mirror command.\\nNow, just before you place that second point,\\nright click again though and select Copy.\\nOtherwise, it'll just mirror from one side to the other\\nas if you were erasing the source object.\\nSo make sure you got that copy kicked in.\\nYou can right click at any time\\nto work with these grip editing tools,\\nwhich is quite handy.\\n\\nSo up the polar tracking line,\\nmake sure you've got 90 degrees,\\nleft click on the polar tracking line,\\nand you can see now that you've done a mirror\\nand a base point and a copy.\\nAll you got to do now is press Enter to finish,\\nmake sure you hit Esc to deselect the selected objects.\\nThat's the one thing when you grip editing,\\nmake sure you hit Esc to deselect the original objects.\\nIf we zoom out now,\\nyou can see that grip editing.\\nWe've replicated what was in the left-hand cubicle\\ninto the right-hand cubicle.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2027354\",\"duration\":254,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using Boundaries with your AutoCAD

open it up,\\nyou'll notice it does look different.\\nThere's more content.\\nThere's a few more bits and pieces\\nin the AutoCAD drawing itself.\\nObviously make sure you're in the model tab as well.\\nNow we're going to zoom in on the right hand part\\nof the drawing here.\\nSee these green rectangles there like so.\\n\\nNow these green rectangles are little landscaped areas\\nfor people to possibly pop out of the door here,\\npop along here, and obviously take a break.\\nNow we're going to zoom in on that area a little bit,\\nget it central on the screen like so.\\nNow make sure on your

see there's hatch there like so.\\nBut we want this one, boundary.\\nCome into the drawing area now\\nand you'll see the little dialogue box.\\nWe can pick the points where we want the boundary to go.\\nSo we're picking a point that is encompassed\\nby a group of objects and creating a boundary.\\n\\nNow we've got two different types of boundary.\\nYou can have polyline or region.\\nYou tend to use regions when you're 3D modeling,\\nso we'll stick with a 2D polyline.\\nNow the boundary set is in the current viewport,\\nobviously in our model tab.\\nAnd you'll notice here as well,\\nwe can select a new boundary set.\\nSo we can define a set of objects\\nthat are analyzed when defining a boundary\\nfrom a specified point.\\nNow, we don't need to worry about that\\nbecause it's such a simple boundary,\\nbut these tools allow you to refine the objects\\nthat you might use to create the boundary.\\n\\nSo make sure the island detection is on\\nso that if there's anything inside the

we want the hard standing to go, click once,\\nand you can see there is a boundary highlighted.\\nPress enter to confirm.\\nAnd our boundary is now a rectangle on the current layer,\\nthe hard standing layer.\\nNow that's incredibly useful.\\nThat allows us now\\nto hatch in a different way\\nusing hatching in AutoCAD.\\n\\nSo what we do now is we can go up\\nto the hatch command again on the draw panel like so,\\nand we're going to stick on the hard standing layer,\\nthat's great, but we need to make a few changes.\\nNow, at the moment, it's asking us\\nto pick an internal point,\\nbut it's looking like a blob of color.\\nNow, we don't want that.\\nWhat we want is we want a hatch pattern called angle.\\nSelect that there, and we're going to change our scale here\\nto 250 and just press enter to confirm that.\\nSo it's 250, now when you hover,\\ncan you see it's a little bit more legible.\\n\\nSo we just want to make sure that we up that scale\\na little bit when

slightly and pan across.\\nAnd you're going to zoom in on these desks here\\nin the reception area of the new office layout.\\nThere we go, like that.\\nAnd you also want to make sure,\\njust hover over the rectangle here.\\nYou can see that's on the furniture layer.\\nJust make sure that you are on the furniture layer\\nas well as the current layer.\\n\\nJust in case you need to draft anything.\\nThen you're getting it right first time,\\nnot having to worry about changing properties\\non objects you've already drawn.\\nSo we're going to take a look at fillet and chamfer.\\nFillet is when you add a radius to a corner.\\nChamfer is when you add a beveled edge to a corner.\\nNow these two commands\\nallow you to enhance your geometry really quickly\\nand really easily,\\nbut they do have a particular workflow\\nthat you need to be aware of.\\nSo they're on the Modify panel up here on the ribbon.\\n\\nSo home tab on the ribbon, there's the Modify panel,\\nand you can see Fillet is there.\\nClick on the little arrow there.\\nYou've got Fillet Chamfer and Blend Curves.\\nYou don't need to worry about Blend Curves\\nat this point in time.\\nSelect Fillet and click on it\\nand come into the drawing area.\\nNow it prompts you to select your first object.\\nNow that's great because you need to select two lines\\nfor a corner to fillet the corner.\\nBut you need to set all of your settings\\nfor the fillet first.\\n\\nSo it's a right click,\\nand you want Radius, like so.\\nNow you'll notice it's asking there\\nfor a fillet radius of 45 by default.\\nWe are not going to use that value.\\nThat's a value I was using earlier.\\nI'm going to type in 150 as the radius of my fillet\\nand press Enter.\\nNow that's great,\\nbut that will only allow me to do one fillet.\\nI then right click again,\\nI can go into Multiple mode and click on Multiple.\\nThat means I can place multiple fillets on multiple corners.\\n\\nHover on this line here, left click.\\nHover on this line here, left click.\\nCan you see there?\\nIt's putting the fillet on the corner, giving you a preview.\\nSo when you click again, there's your fillet there,\\nbut now it's prompting you for another object to filet\\nrather than just doing it once.\\nThat's the Multiple setting kicking in.\\nSo if I hover there, again, see that line there,\\nhover there, click on that line there.\\nNow that's great.\\nIt's placed the fillets nicely on each corner.\\nI press Enter to finish the fillet command.\\n\\nNow has that exploded, that rectangular polyline?\\nSimple answer, no it hasn't.\\nI hover over it, it is still a closed polyline,\\nso you can fillet closed polylines\\nand just regular corners\\nof regular lines and geometry as well.\\nSo let's do a similar workflow on the right hand desk,\\nthe other side of the chair there.\\nSo we go back to the Modify panel,\\nclick on the flyout where it says Fillet and select Chamfer.\\nCome into the drawing area,\\nagain, it's prompting us for that first line.\\n\\nRight click.\\nNow you've got two methods of chamfer.\\nYou've got distance and angle.\\nNow you can jump between the methods there\\nby selecting Method,\\nsaying set settings for distance and angle.\\nWe're going to use distance and the chamfer distance,\\nwe're going to use the same as what we use\\nfor the fillet radius, 150.\\nSo the first chamfer distance type in 150, press Enter.\\nThe good thing is the second chamfer distance\\nadopts the first chamfer distance, 150.\\n\\nThat means you'll get a regular 45 degree angle chamfer.\\nSo just press enter to accept the second chamfer distance\\nas 150 as well.\\nNow again, you've been prompted to select that first line.\\nIt'll allow you to do one chamfer, but that's it.\\nSo we need to right click again and go, ah, Multiple.\\nMultiple is available on chamfer as well.\\nSo I can now chamfer multiple corners instead of just one.\\nSo if I hover there on that line, left

[Instructor] Once again, we're staying\\nin our Office Layout_2.dwg file.\\nWe're going to take a look now at how we utilize\\nthe commands Divide and Measure\\nto allow us to divide and measure geometry\\nand place objects on that geometry\\nalong those divided and measured points.\\nNow, in order to do that,\\nwe're going to change our layer here in the Layers panel.\\nHome tab on the ribbon, Layer dropdown,\\nmake sure you're on the Nodes layer.\\n\\nNow, the reason that we're going to the Nodes layer\\nis we're going to be using the Node Object Snap\\nto divide and measure in a moment.\\nNow, before we do anything else,\\nwe're going to go over to the Utilities panel\\nand click on the flyout and select Point Style.\\nNow, the default Point Style in AutoCAD\\nis this little tiny dot,\\nwhich, unfortunately, doesn't really help you\\nwhen you've got it placed along a line in your drawing.\\nSo we're going to utilize a new Point Style.\\nWe're going to go with this one here.\\n\\nLooks a bit like a circle with a diagonal cross through it.\\nAnd that, weirdly enough, is also the symbol\\nfor the Node Object Snap.\\nIt looks very similar.\\nMake sure your point size is 5%\\nof your size relative to screen.\\nIf you set it in absolute units,\\nwhen you zoom out, it's going to get much smaller.\\nSo relative to screen is an easier setting to use.\\nSo make sure that's at 5% Set Size Relative to Screen,\\nclick on OK.\\nOkay, so our Point Style is set\\nand we're on the appropriate layer.\\n\\nLet's hop up now to Divide and Measure.\\nNow, these are on the Draw panel.\\nClick on the flyout there and just pin open the Draw panel.\\nAnd you've got here, you've got your Point Style\\ncan be placed using multiple points like that.\\nThat's if you're doing it individually.\\nBut moving along, you've got Divide,\\nand you've got Measure.\\nSelect Divide first and come into the drawing area.\\nNow, the object we want to divide is this line here,\\nthis green line for our landscaping near our bin store\\noutside the office space.\\n\\nSo I'm going to select that line there, click on it,\\nand it'll ask me for the number of segments\\nI want it divided into.\\nI'm going to say five.\\nType in five, Enter,\\nthere's our node snaps as such.\\nNow, they're not node snaps, they're actually point objects,\\nand when you hover over them, you get the Node Object Snap.\\nBut I always just call them node snaps\\n'cause they are, they're node snaps.\\nAnd what we're going to do now is we're going to just copy\\nour nice little plant here, our landscaping.\\n\\nNow, you'll notice our plant\\nis actually on the PLANTS layer.\\nNow, you don't need to worry about\\nchanging the layer whatsoever,\\nyou just need to make sure that your object snaps are on.\\nBut also down here on your object snaps on the status bar,\\nswitch on Node.\\nCan you see it's already ticked?\\nIf it looks like that,\\njust click on the word Node, make sure it's ticked.\\nAnd then come down here, click on the arrow there,\\nthat'll close the menu.\\nZoom in a bit now and maybe pan to the center of the screen.\\nI'm going to select my plant like so,\\nzoom in a bit,\\nand then right-click and Copy Selection.\\n\\nAnd ideally, you want to get that intersection in the center.\\nCan you see it there, intersection?\\nLeft-click.\\nNow you're copying your little plant.\\nZoom out a bit.\\nAnd what you want to be able to do\\nis just snap to each node.\\nSo you'll see the node snap, there it is.\\nHover again, node snap, there it is.\\nHover again, node snap, there it is.\\nLittle bit of panning for the last one,\\nand there's another node snap there.\\nJust get over that node snap.\\nThere we go, left-click.\\nEnter to finish the Copy command.\\n\\nAnd as you can see, you've nicely landscaped\\nyour little area there outside your bin store.\\nNow, that was using Divide\\nwhere you divide it into an equal number of segments,\\nfive segments.\\nLet's have a look at Measure over here\\nwith the slightly bigger plant over here.\\nNow, what we're going to do this time\\nis we're going to go to this one here.\\nThere's Measure like so.\\nSo we click on Measure,\\ncome into the drawing area,\\nand select the line to measure like so.\\nClick on it.\\nMake sure you click on it\\ntowards the right hand end where the plant is.\\n\\nNow it'll ask for the length of segment.\\nNow, I'm going to cheat here\\nbecause I know what length of segment we need,\\nwhich is 1,000.\\nLike that.\\nPress Enter,\\nand you'll see they're all neatly spaced.\\nThat's because that line is exactly divisible by 1,000.\\nThat's why I did it that way\\nwhen I created the drawing for you.\\nSo it's the same workflow again now.\\nWe select our plant,\\nwe right-click and we go to Copy Selection.\\nZoom in a bit.\\nMake sure you get the intersection in the middle.\\nThere it is there, left-click.\\n\\nAnd then zoom out a tad,\\nand you can see now, hover over the nodes like so.\\nEach time you get a node snap, just left-click.\\nWork your way along,\\nand you can place them onto those points that you've created\\nby using the Measure command.\\nSo we'll just get to that point there\\nand then get to the last one.\\nAnd then Enter to finish like so.\\nSo you can see now that we've got some nice landscaping\\naround there like so.\\nNow, one of the things that you want to do\\nis get rid of the nodes on the drawing.\\n\\nCan you see them?\\nIf you look in real close,\\nthey kind of clash with the planting.\\nSo what we want to do is we want to freeze the Nodes layer.\\nSo in order to do that, just go to the Layer dropdown,\\nperhaps just select the zero layer, the default layer,\\nand then go to the Layer dropdown again.\\nNow, zero is the current layer, but if you go to Nodes here\\nand click on the little sun symbol,\\nthat'll turn to a snowflake\\nand you've frozen the Nodes layer.\\nHit escape once to lose the Layer dropdown.\\nCan you see now that the nodes have gone?\\nThe points, the AutoCAD points\\non that Nodes layer have gone.\\n\\nNow, what I am going to do is bring that back again\\n'cause I just want to show you something else\\nthat's quite clever with the Divide and Measure command.\\nSo let's put the Nodes layer back on,\\nclick on the snowflake,\\nand just hit escape once to lose the layer dropdown.\\nNow, what I'm going to do here,\\nyou'll notice as well, when I zoom in and out,\\ncan you see that 5% in relation to the screen size?\\nWhere I've zoomed in and out, they look really big.\\nJust type REGEN and press Enter.\\nThat will regenerate the drawing.\\nCan you see they're now 5% the screen size again?\\nIt's quite clever.\\n\\nSaves you having to worry about the size\\nof those little points\\nthat you've created on that Nodes layer.\\nI'm now going to select these plants.\\nNot the nodes, I hasten to add, just the plants.\\nRight-click and Erase like so.\\nNow, what I can do here is when I use the Divide command,\\nI can actually use a block instead of having these points.\\nSo what I could do here\\nis I can actually, if I want to,\\nremove that last one as well\\nand also remove all these points.\\n\\nSo let's just clear everything.\\nLike that, right-click,\\nand what we'll do, we'll just erase all of that.\\nSo I'm just going to use the line itself.\\nGoing to go down to the layer here, PLANTS.\\n'Cause we want the blocks that we're going to use\\nto divide that line to be on the PLANTS layer.\\nNow, this is one way of doing it,\\nbut you've got to be really careful\\nthat the block is scaled to the right size\\nwhen you're working in the drawing.\\nYou'll see why in a minute.\\nSo I'm now going to go here to our Divide, like we did before,\\ncome into the drawing area and select my line.\\n\\nNow, pick a point at the bottom of the line\\nso that when you divide,\\nit's starting at the bottom of the line and going upwards.\\nSo I'm going to click there like so.\\nNumber of segments,\\nnow, before you put in the number of segments,\\ncan you see in the brackets on the command line, block?\\nRight-click and select Block.\\nAnd the name of the block to insert is plant,\\nlike that.\\nPress Enter.\\nAlign block with object?\\nJust press Enter to accept yes for that.\\nAnd the number of segments is five.\\n\\nPress Enter to confirm.\\nCan you see they're really tiny?\\nThey are the same plant,\\nbut because of the way that the block has been scaled,\\nthey're really tiny.\\nSo sometimes it's easier to use the copy\\nrather than it is using the block\\non the Divide or Measure commands.\\nSo we'll do a few undos.\\nJust take a few steps back,\\nkeep clicking on undo\\nuntil you get all of your little plants back like so.\\nGo to your Layer dropdown,\\nand we'll just go back to that Nodes and freeze that layer.\\n\\nClick on the little sun symbol.\\nSo they're now frozen.\\nHit escape to lose the Layer dropdown.\\nAnd we'll just zoom out, pan across,\\nand you can see we've got a nice neat tidy drawing now.\\nSo we'll unpin the Draw panel.\\nAnd you can see there how Divide and Measure\\ncan be used really effectively in your AutoCAD drawings.\\nBut like I said, if you're going to use blocks\\nwith Divide and Measure,\\njust make sure they're scaled appropriately\\nin the DWG file first.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4000201\",\"duration\":504,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Editing polylines and splines quickly

level\\nwith our office layout drawing.\\nNow you'll notice up at the top,\\nabove the actual office building itself,\\nwe've got some lines, a circle, and a spline.\\nWe've also got a little bit of vegetation\\nkicking in as well.\\nDon't worry about the vegetation,\\nwe'll look at that in the next video.\\n\\nWhat I need you to look at is the spline\\nand these lines here in this circle here.\\nWe're going to take a look at the trim and extend commands\\nwhen we're modifying geometry in our AutoCAD drawings.\\nYou might want to zoom in a bit\\njust so you can see what you're doing like so.\\nAnd what we're going to take a look at first\\nis the extend command.\\nNow the extend command allows you to extend geometry\\nto another piece of geometry.\\nSo make sure that you've got the home tab on the ribbon set\\nand we're going to go to the modify panel.\\n\\nAnd you'll notice here we've got trim.\\nWhen I click on the fly out, you've also got extend.\\nNow, extend, as it says,\\nextends objects to meet the edges of other objects.\\nThat's basically what we're going to do.\\nClick on extend and come into the drawing area.\\nNow, if I right click,\\nI can select what is called a boundary edge.\\nSo select boundary edges on the shortcut menu\\nand select your spline here like so.\\nThat is our boundary edge where we want our lines to go to.\\n\\nSo click on that like so, and then press enter to confirm.\\nNow it'll say select object to extend\\nor shift select to trim.\\nSo when you are extending, you can hold down shift and trim.\\nAnd when you are trimming,\\nyou can hold down shift and extend.\\nRemember that it's quite useful.\\nThey kind of inter purpose\\nwhen you're working in your drawings.\\nNow the nice thing is, is I can now utilize\\na tool in later versions of AutoCAD called fence.\\n\\nAnd what I can do is I can put my pick box about here\\nand left click and just drag the fence\\nthrough all of those lines.\\nThat is my decking that I want\\noutside my building by the way.\\nSo as I come all the way through,\\nget the fence all the way through.\\nLeft click again.\\nAnd as you can see,\\nthey've all extended to that boundary edge.\\nI just press enter to finish.\\nJob done.\\nSo I've extended all of that decking\\nto that curved spline quickly and easily\\nusing the extend command.\\n\\nNow you'll notice the circle, it's the opposite.\\nThey've gone into the circle\\nand we want to trim them inside the circle.\\nSo let's zoom in a bit and get in a bit closer.\\nAnd what we need to do here is use the circle\\nas our cutting edge when we're trimming.\\nSo we're going to go back to the modify panel,\\nclick on the fly out where extend is right now,\\nand this time select trim.\\nYou can't miss it, it looks like a pair of scissors.\\nClick on trim, and this time we're going to right click again,\\nbut it's a cutting edge this time, not a boundary edge.\\n\\nSo select cutting edges.\\nAnd what we'll do now is we'll click on the circle\\nand press enter to confirm that as our cutting edge.\\nNow you've got to be really careful\\nwhere you place your fence this time\\n'cause you want to make sure\\nthat you get all of those lines from those decking lines.\\nSo we're going to just hover and come in here.\\nYou can do it individually.\\nCan you see that?\\nbut you want to place a fence like

just down past that last one.\\nGet the cross hair about there.\\nLeft click.\\nAs you can see, it's trimmed everything.\\nEnter to finish.\\nWe've now got our nice circular landscaped area\\nand

layer dropdown here\\nand make sure that you're using the layer plants like so.\\nWe're going to be working with some planting,\\nso we want to make sure that we put all of the objects\\nthat we create on the plants layer.\\nRemember, get that right the first time.\\n\\nIt saves a lot of time later going in\\nand editing the properties of your drawn geometry\\nor objects in AutoCAD.\\nNow in the previous video,\\nwe talked about trim and extend, didn't we?\\nNow, the planting we're going to look at is this one here,\\nthis one here, and this one here.\\nAnd what we're going to do,\\nwe're going to utilize the array tools in AutoCAD\\nto modify these objects in geometry.\\nNow the array command is basically a copy command,\\nbut with lots of different parameters\\nand variables to allow you to copy objects\\nmuch, much more effectively.\\n\\nNow, we're going to zoom in on this sort of\\nleft hand area here first.\\nI'm just going to pan down like that.\\nSo all we're looking at is the top area above the office.\\nNow this plant here looks a bit lonely on its own,\\nand what we're going to do,\\nwe're going to create a visibility screen from it\\nusing one of the array tools in AutoCAD.\\nNow, the array tools are on the modify panel,\\nso make sure you're on the home tab on the ribbon.\\nThere's the modify panel.\\nThere's the array there.\\nClick on it, and you want rectangular array in this case.\\n\\nNow, we're going to select the object that we want to array,\\nwhich is going to be our little plant here.\\nJust press enter to confirm.\\nAs soon as you do that, you'll see the ribbon change,\\nand we go into our array creation contextual tab.\\nSo you'll notice up here, blue array creation tab.\\nNow it defaults to four columns and three rows.\\nNow, we're going to change the settings here\\nand tweak this to create a nice vertical visibility screen\\nso that people can't see from the left\\ntowards the decking over there on the right.\\n\\nSo number of columns, we're going to change to two.\\nSo change that to two there like that, press enter,\\nand you'll see it goes to two columns.\\nNumber of rows here, we'll change that to 10,\\nand press enter.\\nAnd there's our visibility screen.\\nYou can ignore levels.\\nThat's for 3D arrays.\\nAnd we're working in a 2D plan.\\nNow, very quick and easy to do.\\nNow, because of the default settings though,\\ncan you see the distances between the columns\\nand the rows are a bit weird?\\nThey're just kind of numbers\\nthat it's worked out for itself.\\n\\nSo change those to sensible numbers.\\nI'm going to put 550 for the distance between each column.\\nPress enter, you'll see them move over slightly.\\nAnd the same between the rows.\\nDo the same value, 5-5-0 and enter,\\nand you'll see it updates slightly.\\nNow, the lovely thing about arrays\\nin later versions of AutoCAD is they become associative.\\nYou'll notice in the properties here,\\nassociative is on by default.\\nSo when I click on close array now,\\nnow that that array's been placed,\\nyou'll notice when I hover over it in the drawing,\\nit's all one object.\\n\\nNow that makes my life a lot easier.\\nBecause if I now select that array,\\nit's all selected as one object.\\nAnd if I did need to change the layer of it,\\nI can go up here to my layers on the quick access toolbar,\\nor go to the home tab on the ribbon,\\nand go to the layer drop down there,\\nand perhaps change the layer that it's on.\\nI might change it to landscaping, for example.\\nJust hit escape a couple of times to deselect,\\nand I deselect that associative array.\\nNow, obviously I can change the layer anytime\\nback to plants if I wanted to.\\n\\nDoesn't matter.\\nI'm going to leave it to landscaping at the moment.\\nNow, I'm going to zoom in now on the circle.\\nNow, the circle here is going to allow us\\nto work with a polar array.\\nSo we're going to go up to the modify panel here,\\nclick on the array flyout, and select polar array.\\nNow the object we want to polar array is this plant here,\\nthat one there.\\nPress enter to confirm.\\nAnd again, it asks for a center point this time.\\n\\nNow, with the rectangular array, it didn't need that\\nbecause it was just x and y values.\\nIn this particular case, it needs a center point to work to\\nto rotate that plant in a circular fashion.\\nSo I just hover on the edge of the circle.\\nThere's the center snap.\\nMake sure your object snaps are on, obviously.\\nAnd now it defaults to six objects\\ngoing around that center point.\\nNow, that's a bit bare,\\nso we need to change a number of items.\\nNotice again, we've got the blue array creation tab.\\n\\nItems, I'm going to change that to 12 and press enter.\\nMuch nicer, nice and dense.\\nPeople can walk into that area now\\nand perhaps relax in that little landscape circle there.\\nAgain, you'll notice it is associative by default.\\nAnd also you can rotate the items around the polar circle.\\nCan you see that?\\nThey all follow the circle.\\nThey're aligned to the circle.\\nIf I turn that off, watch what happens.\\nCan you see they all go back to their original orientation.\\n\\nRotate them again in line going around the circle,\\nand you can see it changes slightly.\\nAnd again, you can ignore levels for that.\\nObviously is used with 3D arrays.\\nSo we've set all of that up.\\nIt looks nice, and neat, and tidy.\\nI'll click on close array on the ribbon there.\\nAnd again, we're back to the home tab on the ribbon.\\nAnd if I hover, can you see again,\\nit's an associative array.\\nAnd this time it's polar,\\nas you can see by the description there.\\nI'm just going to zoom out slightly now,\\nand we're going to be taking a look at this little plant here.\\n\\nNow again, we're on the plants layer.\\nYou could use landscaping as well\\nif you wanted to as a layer.\\nBut what we're going to do this time\\nis we're going to look at a path array,\\nand we're going to utilize the spline.\\nSo again, modify panel, click on the array flyout,\\nand select path array.\\nWe need to select the object we want to array.\\nThat's our little plant.\\nSo just select it, click on it.\\nPress enter to confirm.\\nIt then wants the path curve.\\nNow this could be a straight line,\\nbut the whole idea is it should be an irregular path,\\nand it makes your life easier.\\n\\nSo if I select that spine,\\ncan you see it's placed them neatly\\nall the way down the spine for me?\\nAnd the lovely thing about this\\nis I can set it to a number of items,\\nor a number of rows, or levels,\\nbut I can also use measure and divide as well.\\nSo if I now go to divide,\\nit'll divide it into an equal number of items.\\nCan you see that, 17?\\nLet's say I changed that to 15 and press enter.\\nCan you see the spacing gets bigger between the plants?\\nI can also use the grips to edit the array\\nby dragging the plants and changing the spacing.\\n\\nBut you'll notice with divide,\\nI've got a plant at the end of the spline there\\nand at the end of the spline there.\\nIf I change that now to measure\\nand then change the distance between them.\\nSo I've changed that to measure.\\nAnd what I'll do now is go to\\nthe distance between them there and change that to say,\\nI don't know, let's say 650 and press enter.\\nCan you see, it'll update?\\nAnd I can also click on the grip there\\nand change it like that as well.\\nSo can you see there as I move that around,\\nI can just use the grip\\nand make that distance smaller or bigger\\nand make it denser or less dense as well.\\n\\nSo there's ways and means that I can change this.\\nNow, obviously I'll hit escape there\\njust once to cancel what I'm doing.\\nAnd when I'm happy with that, I will then close the array.\\nAnd again, you'll notice it's an associative path array.\\nThat's how quick and easy it is.\\nAnd the, one of the things that I would suggest\\nthat you do here with arrays is a little bit of a\\ncall to action, really,\\nwhere you go and play around with these arrays\\nand see what you can do with them\\nusing the array commands in AutoCAD.\\nThey're incredibly useful if you need to replicate geometry\\nin your AutoCAD drawings.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3997358\",\"duration\":305,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using Stretch and Lengthen to edit AutoCAD

[Instructor] Once again,\\nwe're staying in our OfficeLayout_3.dwg file,\\nand I've left the drawing in the same state\\nas it was at the end of the last video.\\nSo let's zoom out slightly, pan upward a bit,\\nand zoom into the actual office area of the drawing now.\\nWe're going to be taking a look at\\nhow we use the stretch and lengthen commands\\nto modify geometry in our AutoCAD drawings.\\nNow if you look at the office area here,\\nyou can see there's a little line just there,\\nand that line is on the layer Carpets,\\nand it's going to be the carpet line\\nfor these cubicles here, one, two, and three.\\n\\nBut I need to take that line\\nall the way to this wall over here.\\nNow I could use extend.\\nWe've looked at extend previously.\\nI want to show you a different command that you can utilize,\\nand it's called lengthen.\\nGo to the home tab on the ribbon\\nand on the modify panel here,\\nclick on the flyout, and just pin the modify panel open.\\nNow the lengthen command is this one here.\\nIt looks like a little sort of pointy line\\nwith a dot on the end of it.\\n\\nClick on lengthen and come into the drawing area.\\nNow there's various ways and means\\nof lengthening lines in AutoCAD.\\nNow go and look up the lengthen command\\nonce you've done this video.\\nYou can see there's different ones available.\\nI'm going to select the object to measure first,\\nso that's that one here, like so,\\nand that's that line there.\\nSo what I'm doing there now is,\\ncan you see on the command line,\\nthere's delta, percent, total, dynamic?\\nRight click and you can bring those up on the shortcut menu.\\n\\nI'm going to use dynamic in this particular instance,\\nbut I'd like you, once you've done this video,\\nto go and check out total, percent, and delta.\\nJust look up the lengthen command in the AutoCAD help\\nand see what they all do.\\nI'm going to click on dynamic\\nand the object to change is here, like so,\\nand I just drag dynamically\\nuntil I get an intersection over here, click, and it's done.\\nPress enter to finish.\\nThat's how quick and easy it is to lengthen a line\\nusing the lengthen command,\\nbut like I said, go and check out the other ways of doing it\\nwhen you've got a minute.\\n\\nNow that's lengthening the carpet line really nicely,\\nbut the problem we have now\\nis our partitions here don't match to the carpet line,\\nso we need to stretch them.\\nSo this is when we're going to play around\\nwith the stretch command.\\nNow you can click on the pin for the modify panel\\nthat can go back into the ribbon now,\\nbecause the stretch command is there.\\nNow the stretch command is not available\\non the shortcut menu,\\nso you do need to use the modify panel on the ribbon.\\nZoom in on the bottom of this partition here first.\\n\\nSo you can see the bottom of it.\\nThere it is.\\nIt's a polyline and it's on the layer Walls,\\nand we need to stretch that down\\nso it gets to the carpet line here.\\nSo we go to the stretch command.\\nWe select the object we want to stretch.\\nNow when you select it,\\nyou need to use what is called a crossing window\\nor a crossing polygon.\\nPut your little pick box there, left click once,\\nrelease the mouse button\\nand do a crossing selection\\nover the end of the partition wall.\\n\\nLeft click again,\\nenter to confirm that selection of the partition wall,\\nand the base point you want is the midpoint snap,\\nleft click.\\nJust drag it vertically down until you get the intersection.\\nDon't go off like this\\n'cause you can see it looks a bit messy.\\nYou want to just get it down to that intersection there.\\nLeft click, and you've stretched that neatly\\ndown to the carpet line.\\nNow you've got the other partition wall over here.\\nSo again, bit of zooming and panning.\\nZoom in, and what you want to do here\\nis be a bit more accurate with that crossing selection.\\n\\nSo the way that you would do this one,\\nand the way that I would do it as well,\\nis I'd go back up to the stretch command,\\nand you need to do your pick box there.\\nLeft click and release the mouse button\\nand just drag upwards and cross the two desks\\nand the partition wall and left click.\\nNow you've got three objects selected there.\\nRemember to deselect, you hold down the shift key.\\nYou click on that desk there and that desk there,\\nand you can see now that all you've got\\nis the partition wall selected.\\n\\nPress enter to confirm that selection,\\nand it's the same workflow as before.\\nMidpoint snap there, left click, drag downwards.\\nDon't go off to the side.\\nIt will get messy,\\nand you get that intersection there\\nwith the object snaps, left click.\\nWhen you zoom out now, you can see that this partition wall\\nand this partition wall line up neatly with the carpet line\\nthat we lengthened earlier.\\nSo when you zoom out now,\\nit all looks nice and neat and tidy.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"8.

[Instructor] We're starting a new chapter now\\nwhere we're going to be taking a look\\nat how we work with hatching and gradient fills\\nto enhance your geometry in your AutoCAD drawings.\\nNow we've got a new drawing for you to do this.\\nIt's called a metalplate_001.dwg.\\nAnd as usual, you know the drill.\\nYou can download it from the library\\nto follow along with the videos.\\nNow when you open up the drawing in the model tab,\\nyou'll notice we are zoomed into the section view\\nand the side view.\\n\\nIf I zoom out slightly,\\nyou'll see that we do have a planned view\\nof the metal plate as well.\\nBut we're going to be working with the section view\\nand the side view.\\nSo make sure you are zoomed into those\\nlike so on the screen.\\nNow the other thing you do need to check,\\nmake sure you are in the layers panel here\\non the home tab on the ribbon,\\nand your layer is hatching\\nso that you place your hatching on the appropriate layer.\\nNow what we're going to do\\nis we're going to place some hatching in the section view\\nto highlight the areas that have been cut through\\nin that section view in the drawing.\\n\\nSo what we're going to do\\nis we're going to go up to the draw panel\\non the home tab on the ribbon,\\nclick on the Fly out and select hatch.\\nThat will open up the hatch creation tab on the ribbon,\\nwhich is a contextual tab that only kicks in\\nwhen you're working with the hatch command.\\nNow we need to make sure\\nthat we have an appropriate hatch pattern like so.\\nThere you go.\\nANSI31 is the one in the pattern.\\nYou can go down\\nall these different patterns here, you'll notice.\\nBut just go to the top there.\\nANSI31 is a nice default hatch pattern that we can use.\\n\\nNow if I now hover over any area\\nin the drawing, can you see there?\\nIf I hover now, you'll see that I can place the hatch.\\nSo if I go to pick points and hover there,\\ncan you see there's my hatch pattern kicking in like so.\\nNow I need to make sure that the appropriate areas\\nin the drawing are hatched.\\nNow go to your Options panel here like so.\\nSo if I go to here like so and on the flyout,\\ncan you see there, you've got the option\\nto create separate hatches?\\nNow it's up to you if you want to do this.\\n\\nIdeally, really it should all be one hatch pattern\\nfor the section view,\\nbut if you want to create separate hatches of each area\\nthat you're hatching, you would switch that on like so.\\nI'm going to switch it off in this case,\\nwe don't need separate hatches.\\nIt should all really be one hatch pattern.\\nSo I'm going to hover here.\\nCan you see there?\\nThere's an area there to hatch.\\nHover here there's an area there to hatch\\nand hover here there's an area there to hatch as well.\\nNow this bit here is going to be the long hole\\nin the plate in the plan view,\\nso that wouldn't be hatched.\\n\\nWhen you cut through that,\\nyou'd actually be able to see that long filleted hole\\nin the plan view.\\nI'll show you what I mean in a moment.\\nSo these three areas here are also hatched.\\nSo click in each area\\nand then all you've got to do\\nis click on Close hatch creation like so.\\nSo they're now hatch neatly.\\nIf I zoom out slightly, can you see there?\\nIf you're doing a sectional view through that plan view,\\nthat slotted hole with the fillets at each end,\\nyou can see there that that actually would be\\nthat open area there like so.\\n\\nSo zoom in again on the section view and the side view.\\nSo that's our hatching in place.\\nNow, one thing before we leave this video\\nthat I want you to check is to make sure\\nthat it is all one hatch pattern.\\nAnd that's really easy.\\nYou just hover over the hatch,\\nclick on it, and as you can see, it's all one object.\\nIt opens up the hatch editor, you'll notice on the ribbon.\\nSo you can go in and edit your hatch if you need to.\\nAnd this little grip here is like the centroid grip\\nof the hatch pattern as well.\\n\\nHit Escape a couple of times\\njust to obviously dishide the hatch\\nand close the hatch editor.\\nSo that's how you would place some hatching in your drawing\\nto highlight that section view to make it stand out.\\nSo the geometry looks much, much more obvious\\nin that particular case.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2027352\",\"duration\":260,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using the Gradient command for enhanced colors in

layers panel,\\nclick on the layer dropdown,\\nand you want to be using gradient fill.\\n\\nIdeally, you want your gradient fills\\non a different layer to your hatch patterns\\nthat way those layers can be turned on or off\\nor frozen or thawed out\\ndepending on what you want displayed at the time.\\nAlways useful to have them on separate layers.\\nGood CAD practice.\\nNow, in the previous

different property setting.\\\"\\nNow we've got pick internal point kicking in already,\\nbut we don't want to pick anything just yet.\\n\\nWhat we need to do is we need to set our pattern here.\\nNow, if you click down a bit, can you see there?\\nWe've got all different gradient fill settings there.\\nNow ideally what you want\\nis something like linear or cylindrical and so on.\\nWe are going to go for GR linear.\\nGR stands for gradient, and it's gradient linear like so.\\nNow, at the moment, can you see\\nthat's like a vertical highlight with the GR linear?\\nChange the angle there to 90 and press enter.\\n\\nCan you see it goes nicely horizontal for us, GR linear.\\nSo keep it that way with the 90.\\nAnd also come into the options like so,\\nand just click on the little fly out.\\nMake sure that create separate hatches is off.\\nYou want it all to be one gradient fill, like so.\\nNow change the colors.\\nWe don't want blue and yellow,\\nthat's a little bit on the layery side,\\nwe want something that's metallic.\\nIt's a metal plate.\\nSo where it says blue there,\\nmaybe go for a pale gray like so.\\n\\nAnd where it says yellow there,\\nmaybe go for a nice pale blue\\nto give it a metallic kind of look.\\nNow all we've got to do is pick the areas\\nlike we did previously with the hatch.\\nSo we're going to come in here,\\ncan you see it goes one and two and three.\\nClick on each one, one, and two and three,\\nand then you just click on the green tick there, job done.\\nAnd that has now placed that\\nnice and neatly on that section view.\\nNow, here's the little question.\\n\\nWhere has my little hatch pattern gone?\\nNow the hatch pattern is behind the gradient fill.\\nSo we do need to address that\\nto make the hatch pattern sit on top of

chapter,\\nand the drawing is called MetalPlate_002.dwg.\\nIt looks remarkably similar to the one\\nthat you used in the previous chapter.\\nNow what we're going to do\\nis we're going to annotate this drawing\\nusing text and annotation in AutoCAD.\\n\\nNow the whole idea of annotation in AutoCAD\\nis you are communicating your design intent.\\nSo you'll be adding text annotation, dimension annotation,\\nso that people know what's there and how big it is.\\nSo the first thing we need to think about are text styles.\\nNow in the MetalPlate_002.dwg file,\\nthere are already a few text styles in there,\\nbut we need to create two new ones.\\nSo how do we do that?\\nWell, in the home tab on the ribbon,\\nI can go to the annotation fly-out here,\\nand I can use this A with a paintbrush here.\\n\\nWhen I click on it,\\nthat will open up the text style manager like so.\\nIf I click on cancel there, that will close it.\\nI can also go to the annotate tab on the ribbon,\\nand in the text panel here,\\nthere's a little arrow at the end, click there.\\nThat will also open up the text style manager.\\nAnd again, I'll cancel it.\\nThe quicker way for me, personally,\\nthe one I prefer is when I'm in the home tab,\\nand I use the Annotation fly-out here\\nand click on the A with the paintbrush there like that.\\nSo that opens up our text style manager.\\n\\nNow I'm going to select title layout 10 millimeters.\\nNow you'll notice that is using a Calibri font,\\nbold, italic, height 10.\\nNow, I'm not too worried about the actual settings,\\nbut what it does there is it makes sure\\nthat the font name is Calibri.\\nSo if I click on new now, and give my style name a name,\\nso we're going to create one for our notes in our drawing.\\nSo this is going to be called Notes_ and then LAYOUT in caps,\\nand then underscore, and then 3.5 mm.\\n\\nSo that's notes.\\nIt's going to be used in your layout tabs,\\nand it's 3.5 millimeters high.\\nClick on okay, and it pops it in the list of styles.\\nIf I click on that now,\\ncan you see it's adopted the settings from title layout 10?\\nCalibri, bold, italic, 10.\\nAnd it just saves me having\\nto go down this great big long list of fonts.\\nSo I can go there, Calibir's already there.\\nI don't need to go and find it.\\nBut obviously, if you want to find a different font name,\\nthat's entirely up to you.\\nAnd we're going to make this regular.\\n\\nAnd the height there will be 3.5 millimeters\\nas per the description.\\nNow, there are other effects you can use.\\nYou can have it upside down, you can have it backwards.\\nAll of those are used in certain environments\\nand all have their place.\\nBut leave everything unticked there.\\nYour width factor should be one.\\nYour oblique angle should be zero.\\nClick on apply, not close.\\nThat will apply those settings to that style.\\nWe now click on new again,\\nand this time we're going to create a label style.\\n\\nSo labels, type that in, underscore,\\nand then it's model this time.\\nWe're going to use this in the model space,\\nin the model tab.\\nAnd then underscore again and then 15mm,\\n15 millimeters high this time.\\nClick on okay.\\nThere's Labels_MODEL_15mm.\\nSelect it so that you know\\nthat you're editing the appropriate text style.\\nCalibri is there again.\\nRegular, we don't want regular, we want bold.\\nAs you can see, the preview is there.\\nWe don't want upside down, backwards, width facter.\\n\\nLeave all of those as they are.\\nBut the height needs to change.\\nThat needs to be 15 to obviously relay the height\\nto the style name.\\nClick on apply, and pretty much we're there now.\\nSo what we can do is we can click on close.\\nSo we've added those particular text styles to the drawing.\\nNow if I go to the annotation flyout here again,\\nyou can see Labels_MODEL_15mm.\\nIf I click on this flyout arrow, there's all the styles\\nwith little previews in the drawing itself.\\n\\nAnd we want to be using Labels_MODEL_15mm.\\nThere's the preview of it.\\nAnd that'll make that the current text style\\nin your drawing.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4001136\",\"duration\":520,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Working with single line text (TEXT) and

[Person] We're staying in our \\\"MetalPlate_002.dwg\\\" file,\\nand what we're going to take a look at now\\nis placing some text in the model tab and the layout tabs\\nutilizing the textiles\\nthat we created in the previous video.\\nNow, before we do anything,\\nmake sure you're on the right layer,\\nso home tab on the ribbon, \\\"Layers\\\" panel, layer dropdown,\\nand we're going to be using the \\\"Text\\\" layer\\nin the model space, we'll move on to a different layer\\nwhen we're working the layout tabs in a moment.\\n\\nNow, what I'd like you to do is zoom in\\non the right-hand end of the section view and the side view,\\nso we're going to be looking here, like this,\\nso get in nice and tight so you can snap easily\\nand work easily with the text,\\nnow, we're going to add some labels,\\nso I'm going to go to the \\\"Annotation\\\" fly-out here\\nand just check that we're using \\\"Labels_MODEL_15mms,\\\"\\nthat's the one we want to be using,\\nso that's our textile setup.\\nNow, we're going to place some single-line text.\\n\\nNow, I go up to the \\\"Annotation\\\" panel,\\nclick on the fly-out and I want \\\"Single Line\\\" text.\\nClick on it, come into the drawing area\\nand it'll prompt you for some sort of endpoint\\nor base point for your text.\\nNow, you'll notice mine is saying,\\n\\\"Specify right endpoint of text baseline,\\\"\\nso I've obviously used a right justification previously\\nwhen I've been working in this particular drawing.\\nIn order to set the right justification,\\nit's a right-click, and then, justify it,\\nand you get this big long list of justifications.\\n\\nThe default is normally left, that one there.\\nNow, you can set it center, right, you can align it,\\nyou can middle it, you can fit it.\\n\\\"TL,\\\" top left, \\\"TC,\\\" top center, \\\"TR,\\\" top right,\\nmiddle-left, middle-center, et cetera,\\nyou know the drill as you work down.\\nNow, we are going to go for middle-left, \\\"ML,\\\" like so,\\nand then, it'll ask for the middle-left point of your text,\\ncome over to the section view,\\nfind the midpoint, snap, left-click,\\nand now, it'll ask for the rotation angle of the text,\\nif you just move away from where you've clicked,\\ncan you see the rotation angle is being prompted for?\\nNow, we need that to be zero,\\nremember when we were setting units and direction?\\nZero is horizontally to the right, to the east,\\nso we need to just press Enter to accept that.\\n\\nYou'll see a little flashing cursor now\\nnext to that section view.\\nIf you start typing, you'll see the text appear,\\n\\\"Section,\\\" and then, \\\"View,\\\" like that,\\nand you'll see that that text is the same height\\nas the sectional view.\\nI did that deliberately.\\nThat thickness of that metal plate is also 15,\\nhence that's why I set the textile to be the same thickness.\\nNow, the cursor is flashing at the end,\\nif I press Enter, that'll prompt me now\\nfor another line of single-line text,\\nwith each line of text being an individual object.\\n\\nI don't want any more text,\\nso if I press Enter again, you'll see there\\nthat it closes out the single-line text command.\\nNow, the good thing about text is it has grips,\\nso if I now click on this text,\\nsee it highlight and left-click on it,\\nyou can see the two grips there.\\nNow, there's our middle-left grip\\nand there's our default left grip.\\nNow, we want the middle-left grip,\\njust click on it, make it hot,\\nand just drag horizontally to the right,\\nkeeping the polar tracking line kicking in.\\n\\nNow, we're just going to type in there, \\\"15,\\\" like that,\\nand Enter, direct distance entry,\\njust moves it slightly away\\nfrom the objects that make up the section view.\\nNow, we've still got the \\\"Section View\\\" text selected,\\nthat's great, so I can right-click\\nand go to my shortcut menu,\\nit's contextual because I've got an object selected,\\nI'm going to select \\\"Copy Selection.\\\"\\nNow, the base point will not be on the text,\\nI'm going to use the endpoint here, like this,\\nclick on that endpoint, take it down\\nto the endpoint on the side view, click on that endpoint,\\nand also, I'm going to zoom out, pan up,\\nand while I'm still copying,\\nI'm just going to pop one down here as well,\\ndoesn't matter where it is, just underneath the plan view,\\nclick about there, and then, Enter to finish.\\n\\nNow, this \\\"Section View\\\" underneath the plan view,\\nwe can ignore for the moment, we'll come back to that.\\nLet's zoom in here,\\nwe've now got two bits of text that say, \\\"Section View,\\\"\\nthis one is not a section view,\\nso we double-click on the text,\\nthat will allow us to edit the text,\\nthis is our side view,\\nso if I click in this highlighted text box,\\nnow, I get a cursor and I can use my keyboard,\\nbackspace there, I-D-E, for \\\"Side View,\\\"\\nand then, just click outside the text,\\nand you can see there that that updates accordingly.\\n\\nNow, because I've clicked outside the text,\\nit's now prompted me to select\\nanother annotation object to edit,\\nso using zoom and pan, we'll come down here,\\nthis says, \\\"Section View,\\\" click on it like so,\\nit highlights again, click inside the highlighted text,\\nwe'll change this to \\\"Plan View,\\\"\\nmake sure there's a space in there,\\nclick outside the text, again, it prompts us for another,\\n\\\"Select an annotation object,\\\" press Enter,\\nthat will close out that command.\\n\\nSo if we zoom out completely for a moment\\nand just pan a bit,\\nyou can see section view and side view are neatly labeled,\\nand what we're going to do now\\nis just update the \\\"Plan View\\\" text,\\nlet's zoom in, and I'm going to select that text,\\nclick on it so the grips appear, right-click,\\nand on the shortcut menu, select \\\"Properties.\\\"\\nI'm just going to move the \\\"Properties\\\" palette\\nover here to the right,\\nand you can see that the justify is middle-left.\\nClick on the words \\\"Middle left,\\\"\\nclick on the fly-out arrow,\\nI now want it to be top-center,\\nso I click there like so, that will update accordingly,\\nnotice the top-center grip on the \\\"Plan View\\\" text.\\n\\nClose the \\\"Properties\\\" palette, click on this grip here,\\nthe top-center grip, and we'll pop it up\\nto that midpoint there like that, hover, don't click,\\ndrag vertically downwards a little, click again,\\nand that's nicely aligned in the middle now\\nusing that top-center grip.\\nJust hit Escape a couple of times to deselect,\\ndouble-click on the wheel to zoom extents now,\\nand then, roll back on the wheel one,\\nand you can see \\\"Section View,\\\" \\\"Side View,\\\" \\\"Plan View,\\\"\\nusing our labels text style.\\n\\nNow, let's jump into the plan view layout tab,\\nbottom-left of your screen.\\nWhen you jump in there,\\nyou can see that we've got a plan view title block\\nsaying \\\"LinkedIn Learning,\\\"\\nthere's our plan view with our \\\"Plan View\\\" text.\\nWe're going to change the layer that we're using,\\nwe're going to go to \\\"Titletext,\\\"\\nwe're going to go to the annotation here\\nand change the style to \\\"Notes_LAYOUT_3.5.\\\"\\nWe're now going to place some multi-line text,\\nso we go to the annotation panel again,\\nclick here on the fly-out like we did previously,\\nbut \\\"Multi Line\\\" text this time.\\n\\nClick and drag like so to form a little rectangle shape.\\nMulti-line text goes into an area\\nrather than just lines of text,\\nso pick a spot about there\\nand we're just going to type in some text,\\nyou can zoom in if you want to,\\nand I'm just going to type in \\\"Notes,\\\"\\nand this behaves very much\\nlike a word processor, like Microsoft Word,\\nso type in \\\"Notes:,\\\" press Enter,\\nand if I type in \\\"1. ,\\\" can you see there?\\nIt automatically picks up now that\\nthat is numbered text,\\nso I'm going to put all dimensions in millimeters,\\nmake sure you spell it right as well.\\n\\nNotice I've spelt it the English way, full stop there,\\nand then, we'll put something like,\\n\\\"Do not dimension from drawing,\\\"\\nso we'll type all of that in like that,\\nand you'll notice the spell-check has picked up\\nthat \\\"millimetres\\\" is spelt incorrectly,\\nit's not spelt incorrectly, I've spelt it the English way.\\nObviously, it's an American spell-check,\\nso it's expecting E-R-S at the end.\\nNow, when you're happy with that multi-line text,\\nyou can close the text editor, job done, zoom out slightly\\nand you've got some notes there in your layout tab\\nusing your notes text style.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2029147\",\"duration\":575,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating and using AutoCAD dimension styles

[Shaun] We're staying in our MetalPlate_002.dwg file,\\nand what we're going to do now is jump back\\nto the Model tab.\\nWe don't need to be in the Plan View Layout tab anymore.\\nAnd we're going to start taking a look now\\nat how we create a dimension style\\nfor our annotation in our drawings.\\nNow textiles, we've done,\\nand we've placed some single line text\\nand some multi-line text.\\nPretty basic what we've done,\\nbut you can see how that workflow works now,\\nand you can now go away,\\nand little call to action for you,\\nexperiment with that multi-line text and single=line text.\\n\\nNow what we're going to do now is create a dimension style\\nin the same way we created a textile.\\nWe're going to set a bunch of preset settings\\nso that our dimension annotation appears\\nin the drawing the way we want it to.\\nNow before we do anything else,\\ngo to the Layer dropdown,\\nand we're going to make sure\\nthat we're on the Dimensions layer.\\nNow the reason I'm doing that\\nis because you get a preview of your dimension style\\nas you work through creating it,\\nand then you'll see what it looks like\\non the Dimensions layer, the current layer.\\n\\nNow I can go to the Annotation dropdown here\\nand select this little dimension\\nwith a paintbrush on it here.\\nThat will open up the Dimension Style Manager.\\nI'll just close that,\\nor you can go to the Annotate tab,\\nDimensions panel, little arrow there.\\nThat will also open up the Dimension Style Manager.\\nI'm just going to click on close there\\nand go back to the Home tab.\\nI'm going to click on the Annotation fly out,\\npin it open so I can get to it quickly and easily,\\nand I'm then going to go here.\\nI'm going to click here on Dimension Style.\\n\\nNow it's very important that you go through all of this.\\nIt is a bit long-winded,\\nbut every time you create a dimension style,\\nyou have to go through this workflow.\\nSo you can see that we've got\\nsome default dimension styles in there.\\nWe need a new one,\\nso I'm going to click on New\\nand the new style name is going to be Training,\\nlike that, _ANNO, A-N-N-O,\\nwhich stands for Annotative.\\nWe're going to start with the default Annotative style,\\nand we're going to tick the Annotative tick box there as well.\\n\\nWe're going to use it for all dimension types.\\nNote that you can create sub-styles\\nfor different dimension types.\\nSomething to maybe investigate for you later.\\nWe're going to use it for all dimension types, though.\\nSo that's our new style name.\\nWe're going to start with the Annotative style,\\nwhich has already been preset.\\nWe're going to make sure it's Annotative,\\nand we're going to click on Continue.\\nWhat'll happen now\\nNotice it's Training_ANNO at the top,\\nso that's our dimension style.\\nNow there's a lot of stuff in here that you will need\\nand a lot of stuff in here that you won't need.\\n\\nI'm going to take you through sort of,\\nI suppose, it's Shaun's ideal default dimension style,\\nand then you can take that as a foundation\\nand develop your dimension styles accordingly.\\nSo we've got to think about dimension lines.\\nThese are those lines that go\\nbetween the arrow heads on the dimensions in the preview.\\nI normally set all of this to ByLayer\\nso it adopts the properties of the layer it's on,\\nwhich is the Dimensions layer.\\nSo set all of that to ByLayer.\\nBaseline spacing, I'm working in millimeters.\\n\\nI'm going to make that 10 millimeters\\nso that when I create a baseline,\\nthe spacing between the dimensions is 10 millimeters.\\nI'm not going to suppress any dimension lines.\\nNow extension lines are the lines\\nthat come off the geometry,\\neither side of the dimension line.\\nSo again, we'll set these to ByLayer.\\nAs you can see, they all start to go red,\\nso make sure they're all set to ByLayer,\\nand again, you don't need to suppress the extension lines.\\nNow, extend beyond dimension lines is the little bit\\nthat goes past the arrow head there on the dimension line.\\n\\nSo I'm going to change that to 2.5 millimeters.\\nAnd my offset from origin,\\nyou need that to be a reasonable size.\\nI tend to go for four millimeters.\\nNow if I press Tab on the keyboard\\nto go to the next cell in this particular tab\\non the dialogue box,\\ncan you see that the distance between the geometry\\nand the extension line changes?\\nThat's at four.\\nWe don't need fixed-length extension lines.\\nYou can set them if you wish.\\nSymbols and Arrows, quite subjective, this tab.\\n\\nNow at the moment,\\nwe're using Closed filled arrowhead.\\nYou can see that there.\\nThey tend to be my preference,\\nbut you could use Architectural ticks if you wanted to.\\nYou could use Origin indicators if you wanted to.\\nIt's entirely up to you,\\nbut I'm just going to go with Closed filled arrowheads\\npurely for simplicity.\\nNow, leaders, you might want to change that\\nto something like a dot instead.\\nA leader line doesn't tend to have an arrow on it.\\nIt tends to have a dot on it.\\nAnd I'm going to change the arrow size to 3.5.\\n\\nNow, center marks, I don't tend to use these.\\nI tend to set that to None.\\nAnd then I use my center lines\\nand my center marks\\nthat are available on the Annotate tab\\non the ribbon.\\nUp to you if you want to use marks or lines, though.\\nAgain, investigate that if you want to.\\nDimension breaks, if you break a dimension,\\nit puts a preset space, 3.75 millimeters,\\nand there's an arc length dimension,\\nwhere you can have an arc length symbol.\\nJust leave it Preceding dimension text for now,\\nYou can have jog radiuses as well, or radii, I should say.\\n\\nAnd the jog angle can be 45 degrees.\\nAny linear jogs that you put in\\nwill be 1.5 times text height.\\nAgain, I'm just leaving all of that as it is.\\nI'm going up to the Text tab now.\\nNow the text style at the moment is Standard.\\nI have got a preset text style\\nfor dimensions in this drawing.\\nIt's called Dims_MODEL.\\nSo if you select that,\\nit'll put it onto the Calibri font basically\\nso it matches the textile that we created earlier.\\nText color, again ByLayer.\\n\\nYou can have a fill color.\\nSo if I went yellow,\\ncan you see it puts a yellow fill around it?\\nJust go for none on that for the moment.\\nText height, I'm going to make that 3.5.\\nThat will then match my notes text style\\nthat is also 3.5 height.\\nYou can have fractions.\\nYou can draw a frame around the text if you wish.\\nThat's entirely up to you.\\nText placement is vertically\\nabove the dimension line,\\nhorizontally-centered along the dimension line.\\nView direction is left to right.\\n\\nIf you change that right to left,\\nyou'll see it kind of goes upside down, wrong way round.\\nThat's for different sort of views,\\nside views, plan views, et cetera, sectional views.\\nMake sure it's left to right for now.\\nMake sure the offset from the dimension line is sensible.\\nI normally go for about 1.5 millimeters there.\\nIf I Tab that,\\ncan you see it starts to look more sensible?\\nNow also as well, you want to make sure\\nthat your text alignment is good.\\nIf you go all horizontal, they look like that.\\nIf you go aligned with dimension line,\\nthey look like that.\\n\\nISO standard, any radio or diameters\\nwill have this little horizontal crank.\\nAligned with dimension line uses up less space\\non the drawing.\\nIt's a little bit more sort of easy\\nto manipulate in the drawing\\nif you go with Aligned with dimension line.\\nNow we're going to go to Fit.\\nNow all of this you can just leave as is.\\nThe only thing you need to check is to make sure\\nthat the Annotative box is ticked there.\\n\\nPrimary Units tab in the dialogue now.\\nThis is where you can override your unit settings.\\nSo the unit format in the units at the moment\\nis two decimal places.\\nIt's defaulted to that.\\nYou might not want that.\\nYou might only want one decimal place.\\nDecimal separator can be a period, a comma, or a space.\\nIn America, you call it a period.\\nIn the UK, we would call that a decimal place\\nor a decimal point.\\nSo period there forms a decimal point\\nor decimal places after it.\\n\\nYou can round off to a certain value,\\nfives, tens, or whatever.\\nAnd there's various scale factors\\nthat you can mess around with.\\nNow what you can also do is on your linear dimensions,\\nyou can suppress any trailing zeros.\\nSame with your angles as well.\\nThat precision there should really go up\\nto something like two decimal places.\\nAnd again, any trailing zeros can be suppressed.\\nNow you'll notice that's exactly 60 degrees.\\nIf I tick the Trailing,\\nnotice the two zeros after the decimal place go\\nbecause it's exactly 60 degrees.\\n\\nYou can have alternate units.\\nSo at the moment, we've got metric units.\\nI might want to display alternate units there.\\nAnd the unit format, if I set it to, say, Architectural,\\nif you look real close,\\nyou can see you've got the metric dimension,\\nfollowed by, in brackets there, the imperial dimension.\\nI'm going to turn that off.\\nI just want metric in this drawing.\\nAnd then any tolerances I might want to set,\\nso I might have symmetrical deviation limits.\\nSo if I went to Limits,\\nI can have plus or minus one\\nand all that kind of stuff.\\n\\nAgain, Tolerances, leave set to None for the moment.\\nSo when I click on OK now,\\nyou'll see that we now have Training_ANNO\\nas a current dimension style there.\\nMake sure you Set Current as well just in case,\\na little bit of a fail safe there.\\nAnd when I click on Close,\\nyou'll notice now our current dimension style\\nis Training_ANNO,\\nready to place some dimension annotation on the drawing.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4001135\",\"duration\":530,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Adding dimensions to your AutoCAD drawings

Can you see that?\\nIt might come up as an intersection. Endpoint is displaying.\\nClick there, drag upwards a little bit.\\nClick again. So three clicks.\\nOrigin point, origin point,\\nand then the position of the dimension.\\nWe're going to do the same again.\\nNow you can just right-click and Repeat DIMLINEAR.\\nI'm going to go down here.\\nNow you'll notice you get a node snap.\\nYour origin points are nodes when you place them.\\nSo the origin points for any dimension are nodes.\\nSo if you see a node snap, that's great.\\n\\nClick on the node, and then we come over here.\\nI'm going to use this end point or intersection here.\\nThere's the end point there.\\nNow if I want this to line in,\\nI can hover, and I can also get that node there.\\nCan you see there's a node there, like so?\\nClick there, all lines in nicely.\\nNow it's all well and good using the node there off\\nof existing dimensions,\\nbut you really should be snapping to geometry.\\nNow my node snap is on, so I'm going to come down here\\nand turn node off in my Object Snaps.\\n\\nI'll click once in the drawing to close the menu.\\nI'll show you what I mean.\\nIf I now right-click and repeat DIMLINEAR,\\nnow I get the endpoint snap, not the node snaps.\\nI'm snapping to the geometry, not the origin point.\\nAnd same again, endpoint at the end.\\nAnd we'll come up here, you get an endpoint\\ninstead of a node there as well.\\nAnd they all line in together nicely.\\nSo that's easily placing some linear dimension types there.\\nWe're going to go back and we're going to go to Linear again.\\n\\nNow I'm doing that deliberately 'cause it resets anything,\\nand you're back to like a default linear dimension.\\nAnd I'm going to come off of this endpoint,\\nand go up to this endpoint and click,\\nand can you see my 15 comes off of the top,\\nso to speak, vertically.\\nNow the reason I've done it that way is because I need\\nto go from there to there to make sure\\nthat that 15 goes there.\\nNow if I do the same again, right-click,\\nRepeat DIMLINEAR, but go from the top to the bottom,\\nand then come that way,\\ncan you see it goes the other way?\\nIt orientates the other side,\\nand it means they don't clash in the drawing,\\nif you see what I mean.\\n\\nIt just looks nice.\\nNow the other thing you might want to do there,\\nyou might want to pop in another linear,\\nso right-click, Repeat DIMLINEAR.\\nWe might do an overall Side View dimension there,\\nendpoint to endpoint, bring that down a bit,\\nand click like so.\\nNow the good thing is you've been using\\nthe appropriate annotation scale.\\nSo when you go to the Sections and Elevations now,\\nthat all looks nice\\nand neat on the Sections and Elevations Layout tab.\\nThat's because you're using the right annotation scale\\nto tally up with the viewport scale of the viewport there.\\n\\nJump back to the Model tab, and zoom out a bit,\\nand look at the Plan View.\\nNow obviously the dimensions\\nfor this are going to be in the Plan View layout there.\\nHover over the viewport again,\\nand you'll notice this time standard scale is 1:2 again.\\nAlways check the viewport scale,\\nespecially when you are using annotative dimensions.\\nSo back to the model, we'll pop a few dimensions\\non the Plan View, nothing major.\\nSo we'll do some different dimension types.\\n\\nSo we'll go for, let's say a diameter.\\nWe'll do a diameter off of this circular hole here.\\nSo that is a diameter 60.\\nWe then might do a radius off of this arc here.\\nSo there's a radius 25 there.\\nWe might do a linear on the slotted hole as well.\\nLet's do that from that center line to that center line,\\nendpoint snap each time.\\nTake that up there, and you might want to pop another radius\\non that other circle on the right hand side.\\nSo we'll do radius again over here.\\n\\nSo you can see there we've got a diameter, a radius,\\nanother radius there, and we've also got a linear there.\\nNow I'll leave it up to you to explore all\\nof the dimension types as you dimension this drawing.\\nBut the one thing I want to just get across\\nto you is making sure that your annotation scale is correct.\\nNow we've been using the annotation scale of 1:2\\nto make sure it tallies up with the viewports.\\nI'm going to select this radius 25 here,\\nand I'm going to right-click,\\nand I'm going to go down to Annotative Object Scale.\\n\\nAnd I'm going to go to Add/Delete Scales.\\nAt the moment it's 1:2.\\nI'm going to add another scale to that.\\nI'm going to go for 1:1, and I'm going to okay it,\\nand I'm going to select 1:2, and I'm going to delete it.\\nWhen I click on OK, keep an eye on this radius 25.\\nIt changes because it's now setting itself\\nto be displayed in a one-to-one viewport.\\nBut if I now go back to the Plan View,\\nthat radius 25 isn't there, and it's not there,\\nbecause it's not using a 1:2 annotation scale\\nbecause the viewport is 1:2.\\n\\nWe've put an annotation scale\\non that particular dimension of 1:1.\\nSo if I go back to the Model tab,\\nselect our radius 25 again,\\nright-click, Annotative Object Scale, Add/Delete Scales.\\nSo I'll add the 1:2 back.\\nI'll select the one-to-one and delete it.\\nAnd okay it, notice it goes back to the size it was.\\nWhen I go back to the Plan View now,\\nit displays in the drawing.\\nBack to the Model tab.\\nSo that's how the annotative part\\nof your annotative dimension style works,\\nand that's how you place some basic dimensions\\nusing that annotative dimension style.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4001134\",\"duration\":371,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using Quick Leader (QLEADER) in your AutoCAD

bar\\nand make sure you are set\\nto an Annotation Scale of 1:2.\\nWe want to stay with that Annotation Scale,\\nand then just double-click on the wheel to zoom extent.\\nSo you can see now\\nthat we've added some nice annotative dimension annotation\\ninto the drawing.\\n\\nNow if I go back\\nto the Dimensions panel here\\non the Annotate tab on the ribbon\\nand click on the little arrow just here.\\nThat will open up our Dimension Style Manager.\\nNow what we're going to have a look at here\\nis one of the settings.\\nSo select Training_ANNO in the list and go to Modify,\\nand I'd like you to go to Symbols and Arrows,\\nthat one there.\\nNow you'll remember the leader here was set to a dot,\\nand we're going to take a look at the Quick Leader command\\nand how we use that dot\\nwith that leader in our dimension style.\\n\\nAlso note it's quite interesting, can you see,\\nbecause our current layer is detailed and its blue,\\nthe preview is displaying in blue,\\neven though our Dim Layer Override is set\\nto dimensions up here in the Dimensions panel.\\nDon't panic if you see that in the blue like that.\\nClick on Cancel\\nso that you don't make any changes to your dimension style.\\nSelect Training_ANNO,\\nand force of habit, good CAD practice.\\nselect the dimension style, Set Current, close.\\nThen you know that you're still using Training_ANNO\\nas your dimension style.\\n\\nNow the Quick Leader command is quite an old command now\\nbecause we use Leaders up here now.\\nWe use Multileaders\\nand set a style for our Multileaders,\\nbut QLEADER is still very, very useful.\\nIt just doesn't have an icon on the ribbon anymore.\\nYou have to type the command in.\\nSo zoom in to the Section view in the center here\\nand pan down a little bit.\\nYou need to be able to see this little part\\nof the Section view here.\\nNow remember dimensions is Dim Layer Override.\\n\\nQuick Leader needs to make sure\\nthat it's using dimensions just regularly\\nFor some weird reason,\\nyou need to make sure in your Layer dropdown\\nin the Home tab that you're on the Dimensions layer as well.\\nOtherwise, it will put it on the wrong layer.\\nDim Layer Override does not apply\\nto Quick Leader for some weird reason,\\nso just be aware of that.\\nNow Q LEADER,\\nyou just type it, Q-L-E-A-D-E-R.\\nOn the dynamic input there, can you see QLEADER?\\nPress Enter.\\n\\nIt'll ask you for the first leader poinT.\\nUsing your crosshair, get in that space there.\\nMake sure you're not snapping to, say, a midpoint.\\nYou want it in the space in the middle ideally.\\nSo what you could do, if you wanted to,\\nhover over that midpoint like that,\\nuse the object snap tracking, hover over that midpoint.\\nWhen you come down to the midpoint there,\\ncan you see the intersection?\\nAnd there you go.\\nThere's your little dot for your QLEADER.\\nDrag your leader line away a little bit to about there\\nand click again\\nHorizontally along the polar tracking, click again.\\n\\nNow it'll ask you for a text width.\\nCan you see that if I move away up here?\\nYou just want to accept the zero there and press Enter.\\nA text width is the space that the text will fit into.\\nSo if you've got a finite space there,\\nyou might want to give that a distance.\\nYou don't need to 'cause we're underneath the Section view.\\nSo we've got plenty of room.\\nPress Enter, and it'll ask\\nfor the first line of your annotation text,\\nwhich is multi-line text.\\nAnd we're going to type Slotted\\nand then we're going to press Enter\\nand we're going to type hole, all lowercase, like that\\nand press Enter again.\\n\\nAnd then it might ask\\nfor another line of annotation text again.\\nYou don't need to worry about that now.\\nYou just press enter another time\\nand it places that Slotted hole text like so,\\nand it is multi-line text,\\nso you can edit it as such if you want to.\\nSo that's one quick use of the Quick Leader there.\\nNow if we zoom out and pan,\\nwe've also got the Slotted hole in Plan view.\\nSo zoom in on the Plan view\\nand we're going to go back to Quick Leader again.\\nSo we can right-click Repeat Quick Leader if you want to\\nor use Recent Input, Quick Leader there.\\n\\nAnd it's asking for first leader point or.\\nNotice the or on the dynamic input.\\nLook at the command line.\\nYou can see that there is a Settings option.\\nSo if I right-click, I can go into Settings.\\nNow there's various settings available,\\nAnnotation Types, MText options, Annotation Reuse.\\nIf you go to Annotation Reuse and Reuse Next,\\nand you've got a piece of text\\nthat you're using for lots of leaders\\nthat is the same,\\nif you do Reuse Next,\\nit'll put that piece of text in each Quick Leader,\\nwhich is very, very useful.\\n\\nI'm going to frame the text this time around\\nand click on OK.\\nIt'll ask for the first leader point.\\nI'm going to go to about there,\\nleft-click, and there's my little dot.\\nSo angled line first.\\nI'm using a 45-degree polar tracking there,\\nwhich I've just left set on.\\nYou can use that if you want to,\\nor you can have a a different angle.\\nIt doesn't have to be 45 degrees.\\nLeft-click there, and then do the horizontal,\\nleft- click again,\\nand you get your prompt for your text width,\\nas you can see.\\nAgain, just accept the zero by pressing Enter.\\n\\nAsks for the first line of annotation text.\\nI'm going to type Slotted hole, all one line this time,\\nas you can see.\\nEnter once, Enter twice.\\nNow it's got the little frame around it\\nthat I changed in the settings.\\nSo if I now jump to my Plan View Layout tab,\\nthere's my dimensions\\nand my nice Slotted hole Quick Leader as well.\\nJump back to the Model tab,\\nand that's a nice little use there\\nof the Quick Leader in the drawing.\\nIt's always a good habit to double-click on the wheel\\nto zoom extents as well.\\n\\nGood CAD practice\\nso that when you come back to

[Instructor] Once again, we're staying\\nin our metalplate_002.dwg file,\\nand we're going to be taking a look now\\nat how we place our table into our AutoCAD drawing.\\nWe created the table style in the previous video.\\nWe now need to add the table using that table style.\\nNow just before we start,\\nwe're going to have a little bit of housekeeping.\\nTables. do not use the dim layer override here, like so.\\n\\nSo what we're going to do there is we're going to go back\\nto the Home tab on the ribbon.\\nWe're going to go to the Layer dropdown\\non the Layers panel and select Text, like so.\\nWe're going to put it on the text layer for now.\\nAnd then we will go back to the Annotate tab\\nand we'll make sure here\\nwe're using our hole types table style.\\nNow, a little bit of housekeeping.\\nI want to place the table underneath the side view here,\\nbut we've got a 500 dimension in the way.\\nSo select that dimension, right click,\\nand what we'll do is we'll erase it,\\nclicking on erase on the shortcut menu.\\n\\nAnd we'll just quickly add a new dimension.\\nNow the reason I wanted to do this is to show you\\nhow dim layer override works.\\nNotice on the Quick Access toolbar there,\\ntext is the current layer.\\nDim layer override though is set to dimension.\\nSo if I click on the dimension type and go linear,\\nand I'm going to go from this endpoint snap here, left click,\\nto this endpoint snap here, left click.\\nDrag that upwards a little bit, left click.\\nNow there's my 500 dimension, just in a different place.\\n\\nIf I hover over it, you'll see it's on the Dimensions layer\\nusing that dim layer override,\\neven though the current layer is set to text.\\nNow zoom in underneath the side view\\nwhere you removed that dimension,\\nand just do a little bit panning and zooming.\\nIdeally, you want it roughly in the middle under here,\\nour table, so that when we go\\nto the Sections and Elevations layout tab,\\nit's displayed in that view port.\\nNow I'm going to go up to the table command\\non the Tables panel, and it'll ask me now, table style.\\n\\nhole types is already preset.\\nThat's the current table style.\\nWe're starting from an empty table.\\nWe're not using a data link,\\nwe're not using object data in the drawing.\\nNow for the life of me,\\nI've never understood why you can turn the preview\\non and off in the insert table dialogue box.\\nSurely you always want to see the preview of the table\\nthat you're going to place.\\nAnyway, I'm not going to worry.\\nOurs is not to reason why.\\nAutodesk have put it in there for a reason, obviously.\\nNow, insertion behavior,\\nwe're going to specify an insertion point.\\n\\nYou can specify a window where it squishes your table\\nto fit into that window.\\nWe're just going to specify insertion point\\nand use the table style settings.\\nNumber of columns is going to be three.\\nAnd the column width, we're going to make it 75 millimeters.\\nData rows, we're going to have two,\\nbecause we've only got two types of holes.\\nAnd the row height of each of those is going to be one line.\\nWe're then going to utilize the traditional setup here.\\nTitle, header, data.\\n\\nAs you can see in the preview title, header, data.\\nClick on Okay, and there's our table.\\nJust line it up underneath\\nthe side view about there and left click once.\\nAs soon as you do that,\\nyou'll see the multi-line text editor kick in\\non the ribbon at the top of the screen.\\nSo that text editor tab,\\nthe blue contextual tab, is the multi-line text editor.\\nAll texts that you put into an AutoCAD table\\nis multiline text, or MText.\\n\\nSo now we're looking at the title bar there\\nwith the flashing cursor.\\nSo we're going to put in there hole types, like so.\\nAs you can see, very, very quick and easy.\\nI can use the tab key\\nand the arrow keys now to move around the table.\\nNow these are our headers.\\nSo we now need the hole description, or the hole number.\\nLet's say hole number.\\n\\\"hole type number,\\\" we'll call it.\\nThere we go.\\n\\\"Hole Type No.\\\"\\nSo that's our header for that particular column.\\n\\nTab across, and this one is going to be radius.\\nTab across again.\\nAnd this one's going to be diameter, like so.\\nSo if you keep tabbing, just takes you down to the next one,\\ncan you see there?\\nSo there's our hole type number.\\nSo our hole type number one will be there.\\nSo we just put a number in. This is all just typing in text.\\nThe radius of our hole type one will be,\\nI think if I remember rightly, it's going to be 30.\\n\\nSo let's put 30 in there like that,\\nwhich means a diameter of 60.\\nAnd then the hole type two.\\nNow notice, I've clicked away.\\nCan you see when I click away, it stops editing.\\nJust double click in the cell again\\nand you can edit again like so.\\nSo that's a hole type two, which is our slotted hole.\\nAnd the radius of that one will be 25,\\nbut there won't be a diameter\\nbecause there's only the arcs\\non the end of the slotted holes.\\nSo just tap that across,\\nand you might want to put, say, a dash in there instead.\\n\\nAnd then just click away from the table.\\nNow that's a great little table,\\nbut it's not as descriptive as it could be.\\nAnd you'll notice where I've put the numbers in.\\nIt's write justified everything as well.\\nSo what I'm going to do, I'm going to just click and drag\\nover the cells here like that.\\nAnd when I do that, it allows me now\\nto go into the table cell editor.\\nSo it's a bit like the multiline text editor,\\nbut I'm editing table cells.\\nYou'll notice that we can go\\ninto all the different settings for the cells.\\n\\nNow alignment is here, and we want middle center.\\nJust middle center them like so.\\nThey just look neater that way.\\nAnd then just hit escape a of times.\\nJob done.\\nIf you want to edit any of the information in the cells,\\nit's just a case of double clicking in the cell.\\nThere's radius.\\nWhat I might do there is put some parentheses in\\nand just let people know that that's millimeters.\\nAnd then I'll tab, and the same with diameter there.\\nI'll click in that cell\\nand put millimeters there as well,\\njust so people know that it's millimeters.\\n\\nI'll then click away from the table.\\nNow, hole type number.\\nThat doesn't give me a description of the hole.\\nIt's got the hole type number, but no real description.\\nSo I'll double click in that cell.\\nThere's the one, and then I'll put space dash space,\\nand that will be a bolt hole like that.\\nAnd then I can use the down arrow key,\\nchange the data type or change the value.\\nI'm going to change the value like so,\\n'cause I'm changing the value of the information in there,\\n'cause I'm combining numbers and letters.\\n\\nUse the down arrow key now to go down one.\\nAnd again, it's saying change the value.\\nIf you need to do that, just click away.\\nAnd you might have to change the data type,\\nbecause it's saying the enter value\\nis not a valid data type.\\nNow the reason it's doing that,\\ndo you remember when we set up the table style\\nand we had data in the data cells?\\nWell, it's not data anymore, it's letters and numbers.\\nSo we might need to change the data type just to a label.\\nSo let's do that again in here, like so.\\n\\nClick in there, space dash space,\\nand this will be the slotted hole.\\nAnd again, if I click away, change the data type\\nbecause it's not just numerical data anymore.\\nSo now we've got hole type numbers.\\nNumber one is a bolt hole.\\nNumber two is a slotted hole.\\nRadius for the bolt hole, 30.\\nDiameter, 60.\\nRadius for the slotted hole is 25.\\nIf you zoom out a bit, you can see there radius, 30.\\nDiameter, 60, for hole type one.\\nAnd there's that radius 25 on the slotted hole,\\nwhich is hole type two.\\n\\nSo what we've done there is we've placed a simple table,\\nand if I go to the Sections and Elevations layout,\\ncan you see it displays nicely underneath\\nand just lets people know what the hole types are\\nand what their radius and diameters are.\\nSo a quick and easy table\\nusing a really simple table style.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2029146\",\"duration\":275,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating and using multileader styles in your AutoCAD drawings\",\"fileName\":\"4261301_en_US_10_08_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":283,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"Please ensure that ALL references to AutoCAD Watt Beta are REMOVED/FADED in THIS chapter!

up to the endpoint, snap there, left-click.\\nNow as soon as you do that,\\nyou will see a tiny little cursor flashing there, like so.\\nNow what you'll find is as you start typing EL4,\\nit'll look really big, like so, with a flashing cursor.\\n\\nPress Enter once and then Enter again\\nand you'll see the EL4 is then placed vertically\\nin the little box there.\\nHere's the problem, though.\\nThe text doesn't fit in the box.\\nHow do we fix that?\\nWell, normally you'd select the text like that,\\nright-click, go to Properties\\nand you'd go to the Text Height here, which is 367.87.\\nClick in the box and just make sure your cursor's in there.\\n\\nGet rid of that, type in 150 as the height for the text,\\npress Enter and nothing changes.\\nOkay, what's happened there then?\\nSo this is where you might have an issue\\nwhen you are using that align tool\\nfor the justification of Single Line text.\\nIt hasn't just aligned it orientation-wise vertically,\\nit's aligned the text height based on the length\\nfrom each point that you selected\\nto align the text in the first place.\\n\\nSo you can't get away with that.\\nYou can't change the height of that aligned text.\\nSo close the Properties palette by clicking on the cross.\\nThe text is still selected, we'll right-click\\nand will we'll erase that aligned text.\\nNow one of the things that's really nice about AutoCAD is\\nthere's normally another way of doing something\\nand what we're going to do now is we're going to do it\\na different way using object snaps and object snap tracking.\\nIt's much, much easier.\\n\\nNow what we need to do is go back to our Single Line text.\\nSo flyout there, Single Line text,\\ncome into the drawing area, right-click and Justify.\\nWe're going to go for middle center, MC.\\nNow what's the middle point of the text, okay,\\nso the middle point of the text, we hover over the midpoint,\\nsnap there, like so, we hover over the midpoint,\\nsnap there, like so.\\nObject snap tracking will kick in\\nwhen they intersect, left-click.\\n\\nNow we've got the point of the middle center of the text\\nto move away a little bit.\\nIt's asking for the rotation angle of the text.\\nNow we don't want it horizontal\\nlike the EL4 that we can see.\\nSo we type in 90 to rotate it through 90 degrees.\\nWe then press Enter\\nand you'll see a little flashing cursor there.\\nCan you see it in the middle?\\nSo you type your EL4.\\nNow the text is very small, press Enter once,\\npress Enter twice, it's even smaller when you close out\\nthe Single Line text command\\npressing Enter for the second time.\\n\\nSo zoom in on that tiny little bit of text.\\nCan you see it there?\\nIt is vertical, which is great.\\nSelect it, right-click, Properties.\\nChange the text type there.\\n4.5 is not what we want, we want 150.\\nPress Enter, you see the text obviously gets bigger.\\nClose the Properties palette by clicking on the cross,\\nzoom out, and EL4 now sits really nicely there\\nin the center of that box.\\nHit Escape a couple times to deselect the text\\nand you can see there that we've now placed\\nthat text effectively in that little box there\\nand it looks the same as the EL5 up there.\\n\\nNow what you've got to realize there is with AutoCAD,\\nthere's always more than one way of doing something.\\nSometimes you might hit a brick wall and you'll think,\\nwhy is it not doing it the way I want it to do?\\nThink out of the box, if you'll pardon the pun,\\nand try and find a different methodology.\\nThere's always a way of getting around it\\nand making it look the way you want it to look,\\nand that's one of those methodologies\\nthat I've just shown you there.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"10.

into\\nwhen you're not working on your drawing,\\njust zoom extent\\nso you can see everything that's going on.\\nNow what we are going to do,\\nwe're going to create a new layer.\\n\\nNow we're going to go to the home tab on the ribbon.\\nInto layer properties here on the layers panel,\\nand that opens up our layer properties manager.\\nNow this is our all encompassing layer properties,\\nsort of font of all knowledge,\\nif you see what I mean.\\nAnd as you can see,\\nyou've got all your layer names,\\nwhether they're on or off, frozen or thawed,\\nlocked plot, color line type et cetera.\\nAnd you can go and select any layer,\\nand you can look at all the properties\\nof that layer.\\nSo I can slide down here using the slider,\\nand I might select, say the grid layer.\\n\\nThere you go using color 191,\\ngrid line 12 line type, et cetera, et cetera.\\nNow that's all well and good\\nwith existing layers,\\nbut what happens if I need to create a new layer?\\nWell, this is where these little icons here\\nkick in.\\nThey're very useful.\\nThis one here with the little star on it\\nis new layer.\\nSo you can see there I've got layer two.\\nNow the reason it's named it layer two\\nis there's already a layer one there,\\nwhich I don't actually need.\\nI'll get rid of that in a moment.\\nBut layer two here, I'm just going to type in here,\\nI'm going to call it landscaping.\\n\\nLike I say.\\nThere you go, landscaping.\\nI'm going to change the color of the layer\\nby clicking on the color box.\\nAnd we'll go for that green there.\\nColor 102.\\nSo it's a nice green color,\\nand we'll click there again.\\nWe want it to be a line type continuous\\nand we'll, okay that.\\nSo landscaping is color 102,\\nand it's using a continuous line type.\\nNow that's great.\\nI want it to be the current drafting layer\\nas well.\\nSo with it still selected,\\nI can go up to the little green tick box there.\\n\\nCan you see it.\\nSet current.\\nCurrent layer is now landscaping.\\nSo anything I draw now will be on that layer.\\nSo if I now close the layer properties manager,\\nthat layer is ready to be used.\\nAnd as you can see,\\nit's the current drafting

go, like that.\\n\\nAnd I go to the layer drop down here like so,\\nand I put them on the landscaping layer\\nby selecting landscaping.\\nIf I hover over them now,\\nI'll hit escape first just to deselect.\\nThere you go.\\nNow it may be that that landscaping layer\\nhas the wrong green.\\nSo I go to the layer dropdown, like so,\\nand I can click on the little box there.\\nNotice I've got some of the layer tools.\\nI've got on or off,\\nfreeze or thaw, lock or unlock.\\n\\nI've also got color.\\nClick on the color box,\\nand I might want it to be that green there.\\nColor 112

[Instructor] Once again,\\nwe're staying in our GND Floor Plan_REV5.dwg file,\\nand what I want to show you are some of the layer tools\\nthat are really, really useful in AutoCAD\\nthat allow you to work effectively\\nwith your layers all the time\\nwhen you're drafting in your AutoCAD drawings.\\nNow we're in the Home tab on the ribbon.\\nGo to the Layers panel and pin it, open like so.\\nHit the pin there.\\nDon't worry about this Layer State\\nor any of these tools here for the moment.\\n\\nWe're going to be looking at these tools in here mainly.\\nOkay, these are the ones that we're going to look at.\\nNow I love some of these tools\\nbecause they're really, really useful.\\nBefore we do anything else, though,\\nzoom in to your sort of landscaped area here,\\nwhere you've got your tables\\nand your bike racks and everything else.\\nNow there's a Make Current here, like so.\\nSo if I click on Make Current\\nand come here,\\n\\\"Select the object whose layer will become current.\\\"\\nSo if I go over there like that, click on that,\\ncan you see that Bike Bays\\nis now the current drafting layer?\\nIt's incredibly useful, isn't it?\\nNow I've also got this one, Match Layer.\\n\\n\\\"Changes the layer of a selected object\\nto match the destination layer.\\\"\\nSo if I click on Match Layer,\\nit's selecting an object first.\\nSo I'm going to select my table, like so.\\nThere you go.\\nAnd then I'm going to right-click\\nand select the object on the destination layer,\\nthat one there.\\nto the Bike Bays layer?\\nNow, ideally, we want these two here\\nto be on the appropriate layer,\\nso what we want to make sure\\nis they're on the appropriate layer.\\n\\nSo if I hover over this one,\\ncan you see it's A-700-M_FFE?\\nSo I need to get that back onto there.\\nSo what I could do now\\nis I could do another Match Layer, like so.\\nAnd I want this object to be converted.\\nPress Enter to confirm.\\nSelect the object on the destination layer.\\nIt converts it back to the appropriate layer.\\nNow other tools, sometimes you need to turn layers on or off\\nor freeze or thaw them on a global scale\\nrather than on a layer basis, if you see what I mean.\\n\\nSo if you look here, can you see here,\\nif I go to Off,\\nit'll turn off the layer of a selected object?\\nSo if I click there\\nand select this one,\\nCan you see the lines have disappeared?\\nPress Enter to finish.\\nI'll just Undo that to bring them back.\\nAnd likewise, I can turn layers on as well.\\nI can also freeze layers,\\nso I can freeze the layer of a selected object.\\nNow what I'm going to do\\nis I'm going to show you something very clever.\\n\\nI'm going to make Landscaping the current drafting layer,\\nand then if I go to Freeze here, like so,\\nand I click there, like so, and press Enter,\\nnothing happens because you cannot freeze the current layer.\\nHowever, you can turn off the current layer.\\nIf I go to Turn Off here and select that,\\nit will say, \\\"Landscaping is current.\\nDo you want to turn it off?\\\"\\nI can say yes,\\nand it'll still turn it off, like so.\\nPress Enter to confirm.\\n\\nNow if I want to bring that back,\\nI can go to the Layer dropdown here.\\nThere's Landscaping.\\nClick on the light bulb.\\nIt's blue, indicating it's off.\\nClick on it.\\nIt goes yellow, indicating it's on.\\nHit Escape to lose the layer dropdown,\\nand everything's back to where it should be.\\nNow there are a lot of tools\\nin this Layers panel on the ribbon.\\nThere's all these other tools here as well,\\nPrevious, Change to Current Layer,\\nCopy Objects to New Layer, getting away with myself there,\\nand we've also got things like Layer Walk,\\nwhich allows you to display objects on selected layers.\\n\\nSo if I go to Layer Walk,\\ncan you see as I slowly take these off?\\nLet's go with, let's come down here.\\nLet's go down to, say, the GRID lines.\\nSee if I click on GRID lines, can you see there?\\nIt shows me only what's on grid lines.\\nThen I do TEXT.\\nCan you see?\\nAnd it all kind of starts to disappear.\\nDon't worry about it.\\nI can restore on exit.\\nWhen I close, everything will come back.\\nBut that layer walkthrough allows me to click on layers\\nand hide layers that I might not want to see.\\nVery, very useful.\\n\\nSo there's a lot of different tools in there\\nthat allow you to work with your layers,\\nyour layer properties,\\nyour layer settings.\\nMy call to action for you there\\nis to jump in and play around with those settings.\\nYou have Undo up here on the Quick Access Toolbar.\\nIf you make a mistake, just undo it.\\nUndo it a couple of steps if you need to.\\nVery quick and easy,\\nbut those tools are incredibly useful.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3997355\",\"duration\":251,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Working with layer states in AutoCAD

[Instructor] We're starting a new chapter now,\\nand we're going to be taking a look at how we reuse content\\nin our AutoCAD drawings.\\nNow, reusing content is obviously incredibly useful.\\nWhen you reuse content,\\nyou're not having to create content.\\nYou can reuse content\\nand move, copy, rotate, all that kind of stuff.\\nBut there are other tools available in AutoCAD to allow you\\nto reuse content as well.\\nAnd we're going to take a look at those\\nin this particular chapter.\\nNow, when we start this chapter,\\nwe have a new drawing for you.\\n\\nIt's called NewOfficeProject.dwg.\\nSo you know the drill by now.\\nSimply pop to the library or download all of the files\\nand just make sure you've got\\nthe NewOfficeProject.DWG file open.\\nWe're working in the model tab\\nas we've done in numerous other drawings\\nfor this particular course.\\nAnd you'll see it looks remarkably familiar.\\nIt's that little office layout\\nthat we've used previously in other chapters in the course.\\nNow the first thing we're going to look at\\nfor reusing design content\\nis the groups tools in AutoCAD.\\n\\nNow, in order to do that,\\nI'd like you to zoom in on this bin store on the left.\\nThese are blue bins by the way here.\\nSo zoom in, get that front and central like that\\nso that you can see what's going on.\\nNow you need to be on the home tab, on the ribbon,\\nand ideally make sure that you're on the bins layer as well,\\nso that you're using the bins layer.\\nNow, we're not going to draw anything on the bins layer,\\nbut it's always nice to be on the relevant layer\\nwhen you're working on a bin store\\nand you're on the bins layer, much easier.\\n\\nNow what we're going to do\\nis group these polylines together\\nto form a bins group.\\nNow the group panel on the ribbon is right here,\\nso just click on the fly out and pin it open\\nso that you can see all of the tools in the group's panel.\\nNow that's on the home tab on the ribbon.\\nNow you'll notice the group bounding box is on.\\nCan you see that?\\nWhen I click on it, it's off.\\nClick on it, it highlights in a blue and it's on.\\nMake sure the group bounding box is always on\\nbecause then it gives you like almost a boundary\\naround your group, and you can see where it is\\non the drawing.\\n\\nIt's a really useful little visual feature.\\nNow, the best way to create your groups\\nis to go to the group manager.\\nNow you can just click on group here,\\nbut that'll create a group of objects\\nthat don't have a name.\\nIt becomes an unnamed group.\\nIt's much easier to go to the group manager like so,\\nand give it a name first of all.\\nNow, group name,\\nI'm going to be really, really, really basic here.\\nIt's just going to be called bins.\\nThere we go, bins.\\nYou can give it a description as well if you want.\\n\\nIt can be the bin group if you want.\\nWell, let's go wild and have bins group there.\\nNow, as you can see, you can include unnamed groups.\\nNow the really nice thing about this\\nis as you work down this dialogue,\\nwhen you create the group,\\nnow you can click on new here and make them selectable.\\nSo you can add objects to the group.\\nSo make sure they're selectable, that's always handy.\\nAnd click on new and now you select the objects\\nthat want to be in the group, so that's easy.\\n\\nI'm going to click here,\\njust drag my crossing selection\\nover all of those polylines like that.\\nPress enter to confirm and there's my bins group.\\nCan you see bins selectable, yes.\\nNow all I'm going to do now is click on okay,\\nand you'll notice now when I hover over this, it's a group.\\nCan you see that?\\nEven though it's saying that that's a polyline, which it is,\\nbut when I click on it, it's a group.\\nNow you can't see the group bounding box very easily there.\\nBut if I click on the grip for the group and move that out\\nand click over here, now you can see\\nthe bounding box there it is there.\\n\\nNow I'll just undo that\\n'cause I want the bins to stay in the bin store ideally.\\nSo that is our group.\\nNow, obviously that makes your life easier\\nwhen you want to move that group of bins elsewhere,\\nreuse them on another bin store\\non another part of the project, et cetera, et cetera.\\nNow, there are some other really cool tools\\nwhen it comes to your bins group.\\nNow, as I said, we are using the group manager,\\nbut you'll notice here as well, we've also got group edit.\\nWe've got ungroup, which explodes\\nor ungroups an entire group,\\nand you can just lose the group if you want to\\nby clicking on that one there.\\n\\nSo it'll just ungroup it\\nand the group will disappear from the drawing.\\nThe other thing you can do though is select the group\\nand right click, and you'll notice there nothing.\\nI'm thinking, hang on a minute, where's all my group tools?\\nThey're actually on the group's panel,\\nso just hit escape a couple of times.\\nWhat you want to do is go to edit group, this one here.\\nThen you click on the group and there's your tools there.\\nNow, I might want to remove some objects from the group.\\nI can add objects, I can rename the group.\\n\\nI'm going to go to remove objects,\\nand I'm going to remove those polylines there,\\nthose polylines there.\\nPress enter to confirm.\\nAnd now when I hover and click on the group,\\nthere's the grip again\\nand there's the bounding box, but it's a smaller group.\\nNow as you can see, that group is selected there.\\nLet's go up to that ungroup here like so.\\nSo I'll click on ungroup.\\nNow they're just back to their original polylines.\\nIf I go to the group manager,\\nthere are no groups available in the group manager either.\\n\\nAnd there's also some nice tools here.\\nNotice change group description,\\nexplode, selectable, reorder.\\nThere's lots of tools there that you can jump into\\nand play around with\\nwhen you're creating your groups in AutoCAD.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3997354\",\"duration\":342,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating and inserting an AutoCAD block into a

You've got create block or write block.\\nWe'll talk about write block W Block later.\\nYou want to click on create block.\\nNow the block itself, we're going to call it a workstation.\\nLet's call it workstation_001,\\nfor example, you never know.\\nYou might need to create different iterations of that.\\n\\nSo let's call it 001.\\nNow we're going to pick a base point.\\nSo click on the pick point icon.\\nUse your endpoint or intersection snap.\\nYou might want to zoom in just\\nto make sure it's the right corner.\\nThere you go.

Don't want to snap on any\\nof the hatching or anything like that.\\nAs you can see, the X and Y values are not easy\\nto be accurate.\\nSo make sure you use your object snaps.\\nYou can see it's gone to lots of decimal places.\\nBlock unit will be millimeters.\\nThis whole drawing is in millimeters anyway.\\nNow we need to select the objects\\nthat are going to form the block.\\n\\nSo we click on select objects, zoom out,\\nand we need to select the desk, the chair,\\nthe PC, and the plant.\\nPress enter to confirm that.\\nYou'll now see a little preview in the block\\ndefinition dialogue box.\\nYou're going to select delete. Now don't panic about that.\\nYou'll see why in a minute.\\nSo the objects will be deleted,\\nbut the block will be in the drawing.\\nBehavior, it's not annotative, but select scale uniformly\\nas well.\\n\\nThen when you scale it,\\nit scales uniformly in the X and Y direction.\\nAnd little word to the wise,\\nallow exploding of your blocks.\\nIt's really important because if you don't,\\nyou then can't explode the block\\nto perhaps change it and make it different.\\nYou can add a description if you want to. That's up to you.\\nIt's just a text box there with a description there.\\nLike say, and we don't want\\nto open in the block editor, make sure that's unticked.\\nSo we click on okay, and everything disappears.\\n\\nDon't panic. The block is in the DWG file.\\nIt might be worth you saving the drawing at this point\\nto make sure that the block is saved in the\\nDWG file as well.\\nNow I'm now going to go to insert here.\\nAnd again, this is on the insert tab, on the ribbon, insert.\\nAnd if I now scroll down here,\\nyou'll see that we have a Workstation 001.\\nClick on it, there's the base point.\\nPop it in on the endpoint there,\\nzoom out slightly and you hover over it now,\\nit's a block on the layer workstations\\n'cause you utilize that layer zero.\\n\\nThat's how quick and easy it is to create\\nand bring a block into your AutoCAD drawings.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2027345\",\"duration\":390,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Redefining block definitions in an AutoCAD drawing\",\"fileName\":\"4261301_en_US_13_03_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":398,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"Please ensure that ALL references to AutoCAD Watt Beta are REMOVED/FADED in THIS chapter!

Like that, for example.\\nAnd as you can see, what that's doing there is it's using\\nthe AI in AutoCAD to smart place the block.\\nNow, I'm not too worried about smart placing the block.\\nI can use the insertion point there on the cross hair\\nif I want to.\\nI'm going to hit escape a couple of times though,\\n'cause I don't want this block going in like that.\\n\\nI want it to rotate.\\nSo ideally I want it in a different rotation.\\nSo let's hit escape there\\nand let's look at these options we've got.\\nNow, before we jump into those options,\\nthere's the recent blocks I've used.\\nThose are recent blocks from the cloud,\\nfrom other drawings and so on.\\nI can also set my favorite blocks.\\nSo if I go to current drawing\\nand right click on my workstation block\\nand copy it to favorites, when I go to my favorites tab,\\nit's now one of my favorite blocks as well.\\n\\nSo you can be using blocks from all different locations\\nin the cloud, other drawings\\nand save them to your favorites tab.\\nYou can also create block libraries.\\nNow, we don't have any in here right now,\\nso don't worry about that.\\nI'd like you to go back to the current drawing tab\\non the blocks palette now.\\nNow underneath here we've got the options.\\nNow at the moment, the rotation angle is set\\nto zero degrees.\\nNow if I rotate that through 90 degrees, let's say,\\nlet's put in there 90, like so.\\n\\nAnd I'll just press enter to confirm\\nthat value like so as well.\\nIf I now click and drag,\\ncan you see it's rotated it through 90 degrees, like so?\\nIsn't that great? That's exactly what we want.\\nBut it's not the right way round yet.\\nSo let's just not place that block.\\nLet's select it, right click, erase it,\\nand we'll go back here and change that value to 180.\\nLike so.\\nNow when I click and drag, it's coming in the way\\nI want it to,\\nso I pop it there, release the mouse button, job done.\\n\\nNow that's great.\\nThat's been placed nice and neatly in the drawing.\\nAnd what I can do now is I can select that workstation block\\nand I can hop back to the home tab\\nand I can use mirror there like so.\\nRemember, use the little midpoint snap, drag upwards,\\nclick there, erase source objects? No.\\nAnd I've mirrored those\\nand they're now all workstation blocks.\\nNow the other thing that might happen is that\\nwith these workstation blocks, we've got the old PC,\\ncan you see there's the PC block and the monitor?\\nThey might need replacing for more up-to-date computers.\\n\\nWe don't have monitors like that anymore on computers.\\nThey're all flat screens.\\nSo what we can do is we can select the block, right click,\\nand we can go to block editor.\\nNow this opens up a different kind of space in AutoCAD.\\nYou'll notice we have block authoring pallets here.\\nThese are for dynamic blocks.\\nWe look at that a little bit later on.\\nBut all I'm going to do here in this block editor is select\\nthat block there, the PC block, and I'm going to right click\\nand I'm going to erase it.\\n\\nI'm going to close the block editor\\nand save the changes to the workstation 001.\\nNow you'll notice, all of the workstation blocks\\ndo not have the PC on them.\\nIf I just bring the pallet over here as well\\nand I go to workstation here\\nand drag it across, comes in on the original orientation.\\nBut as you can see, there you go, no PC.\\nSo that's really useful as well to allow you\\nto redefine your blocks in your drawings.\\nIt saves you having to go and edit 600 blocks.\\n\\nYou can just redefine the block\\nand it'll redefine the block definition in the drawing\\nfor all of those 600 blocks that you may have in a drawing.\\nYou can now close the blocks palette.\\nAnd what we'll do, we'll remove this block here, just\\nselect it, right click, erase it.\\nAnd as you can see, we've now got different workstations\\nready for perhaps, the new flat screen monitors.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2029141\",\"duration\":136,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Replacing blocks in your drawings\",\"fileName\":\"4261301_en_US_13_04_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":144,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"Please ensure that ALL references to AutoCAD Watt Beta are REMOVED/FADED in THIS chapter!

[Instructor] Once again,\\nwe're staying in our NewOfficeProject.dwg file.\\nNow what I'm going to show you now\\nis a really nice little feature in AutoCAD.\\nIt's called W block or write block,\\nand that allows you to write a block\\nto its own separate DWG file,\\nwhich you can then bring in in any drawing.\\nRemember, it doesn't have to be a block\\nthat you bring into a drawing.\\nIt can be a drawing into a drawing as a block as well.\\nIt's known as a block reference.\\n\\nSo the reference can be objects, geometry, existing blocks.\\nIt can also be a separate DWG file.\\nSo that's what we're going to do.\\nWe're going to create a separate DWG file\\nof some objects that we've got in our drawing at the moment.\\nWe're then going to go and edit that separate DWG file\\nand redefine a block in the current drawing.\\nNow you'll remember that we created this block here,\\nthe little flippy door,\\nso click there, obviously on the flip action there,\\nand make sure the door looks like that.\\nHit escape to deselect.\\n\\nWe're now going to go to the write block command.\\nThat's on the insert tab on the ribbon\\nin the block definition panel.\\nClick on the flyout here,\\nand you've got create block or write block.\\nRemember we've been creating blocks.\\nWe're now going to go to write block.\\nNow the good thing is, in the write block dialogue box,\\nI can just click on block here\\nand I've got a list of all the blocks in my drawing already.\\nThere's Door-DYN there, so I can select that block.\\nI don't need to then worry about\\nbase point objects, et cetera.\\n\\nNow the file name and path is important.\\nNow you can see my long path there.\\nYou need to click on this little button here\\nand then select where you want your Door-DYN to go.\\nSo can you see there?\\nMy Door-DYN already exists in my Reusing Content folder.\\nNow you might want to save that somewhere else, okay?\\nI will make sure, however, that the Door-DYN.dwg file\\nis available in the exercise files\\nwhen you download the exercise files for this course.\\n\\nI'm going to save that in there and then I'm going to click on OK.\\nInsert units is millimeters, by the way.\\nEverything is millimeters in this drawing, so I OK that.\\nNow because it's already there,\\nit's saying, \\\"Hang on a minute, do you want to replace it?\\\"\\nPlease ignore my great big long file path there.\\nSo I'll replace the existing DWG.\\nSo that's now been replaced.\\nIf I now go to open up here on the quick access toolbar,\\nthere's my Door-DYN.dwg file.\\nSo I'll select it, click on open, and open it up.\\n\\nNow because it is a dynamic block in there,\\nyou will get this popup.\\nNow if you use an older versions of AutoCAD,\\nit might not pop up, but it should pop up,\\n'cause it's asking to open it in the block editor.\\nSo yes to that, please.\\nSo there's our block editor there, like so.\\nNow what I'm going to do is I'm going to select the flip state\\nand I'm going to right click and erase it, like so,\\nand I'm going to change the format of our door here.\\nI'm going to obviously go up to the home tab, line command.\\n\\nI'm going to draw a line from there to there and press enter.\\nI'm then going to erase the arc like so.\\nSo right click and erase.\\nThis is all on the 0 layer, by the way.\\nMake sure everything's on the 0 layer.\\nI'll jump into the parameters again.\\nI want my flip parameter.\\nShift and right click like we did before,\\nmid between two points.\\nYou want endpoint endpoint and drag it vertically upwards,\\nclick there, put flip state one, next to the vertical line.\\nActions, we now want our flip action,\\nand we're going to select the parameter to apply it to like so.\\n\\nSelect the objects again, like we did before,\\npress enter to confirm.\\nSo that's all done.\\nSo what I can do now\\nis I can quickly go into the block editor tab up here\\nand test the block.\\nWe go into the test area again,\\njust check that the flip action works.\\nYes, it does.\\nClose the test block\\nand then close the block editor like we did previously,\\nand save changes to current drawing.\\nNow that's a bit weird.\\nWhy is it asking current drawing?\\nWhat it's doing there is it's saving changes\\nto the Door-DYN.dwg file, not the block, okay?\\nIt's a bit weird, but it's saving it to the drawing\\nthat we obviously did the write block\\nout of the existing drawing with.\\n\\nSo save the changes to current drawing.\\nWhen you click on that,\\nyou will see that the Door-DYN.dwg file has closed,\\nand you're back to your original drawing.\\nNow we need to be able to insert the drawing\\nto replace this block here.\\nSo this is our Door-DYN block\\nin our new office project drawing.\\nNow we can use an older version of block insert\\nby typing classic insert, like that.\\n\\nType classic insert, press enter,\\nand this is the old fashioned way\\nof bringing a block into a drawing.\\nIf you click on browse\\nand then go and locate your Door-DYN file\\nthat you've just finished editing.\\nThere it is there.\\nClick on open, and insertion point,\\nI'm going to specify that on the screen.\\nClick on OK.\\nRedefine the block, so I'm going to redefine my Door-DYN block\\nin my NewOfficeProject drawing, and look at that.\\n\\nIt's redefined the block and it's actually saying,\\n\\\"Oh, I can bring another door in.\\\"\\nNow I don't need to.\\nI can hit escape now,\\nbut you'll notice that is now my dynamic block\\nredefined from a write block that we saved as Door-DYN.dwg.\\nI'll just see

[Instructor] We're starting a new chapter now\\nin this particular AutoCAD Essentials course.\\nWe're going to be taking a look at attributes\\nand diving deeper into AutoCAD tables.\\nNow, we've got a new drawing for you,\\nand we're going to be taking a look at attributes first.\\nThe drawing is called Office Workstation.dwg.\\nAnd when you open up the drawing,\\nyou'll see a little desk there.\\nOpen it up in the Model tab, as you can see on the screen,\\nand also in the Home tab in the Layers panel.\\n\\nJust make sure that you are using the Attributes layer there\\non the Layer dropdown.\\nNow what we're going to do\\nis we're going to add some attributes\\nto this office workstation\\nand make it into a block that has those attributes.\\nNow, those attributes give you extra information\\nabout your AutoCAD block.\\nNow, they're text attributes normally,\\nand they can either be visible or invisible as well,\\nso they don't actually have to be displayed on the screen.\\nIn this case, we will display them\\nbecause I want to obviously show you how it all works.\\n\\nBut you can set your attributes to invisible,\\nand then they are data enclosed with the block,\\nand then you can use things like data extraction, perhaps,\\nand drop that into an AutoCAD table.\\nSo let's take a look at how we can place some attributes\\nfor our workstation block here.\\nSo what we're going to do\\nis we'll stay on the Attributes layer for the moment\\nwhile we create the attributes,\\nand then what we'll do is we'll look at layers\\nwhen we bring the block back in into the drawing\\nlater on in the video.\\nSo, we go to the Insert tab on the ribbon.\\n\\nAnd you want the Block Definition panel here.\\nAnd you want Define Attributes, okay?\\nClick on it, and you'll see that you have\\nthe Attribute Definition dialog box.\\nNow, for many, many years,\\nI used to have to create blocks in AutoCAD,\\nand I always used to type in the command\\nfor this particular dialog box to appear.\\nIf you look at the command line,\\nthe thing that I had to type was A-T-T-D-E-F, ATTDEF.\\nAnd that is just the standard keyboard entry\\nto bring up the Attribute Definition dialog box.\\n\\nIf you want to use keyboard entry,\\nobviously it's there on the ribbon as well.\\nNow, you'll notice there's that invisible option.\\nNow, I want you to make sure that that is unticked\\n'cause we want our attributes\\nto be visible in this particular case.\\nNow, the first one is going to have a tag,\\nand it's going to be employee name.\\nNow, remember, tags cannot have spaces in them.\\nIt's really important, otherwise, it just won't work.\\nSo we're going to go EMP, employee, _NAME.\\nI always put them in caps, you don't have to.\\n\\nIt'll automatically convert them to caps anyway, those tags.\\nNow, the prompt there will actually be a physical prompt.\\nSo we're going to have employee name, question mark.\\nAnd the default there,\\nwe'll put in something like Fred Blogs.\\nIn fact, no, I'm going to go wild.\\nWe're going to have Luke Skywalker, let's do that.\\nSo we'll have Luke Skywalker as the default employee name.\\nNow, the other thing we need to do\\nis make sure that the Specify on-screen is ticked\\nso that we can specify where it goes.\\n\\nJustification to the left is fine, that's the default.\\nText style, though, I'm going to change that to standard.\\nAnd text height, for this drawing,\\nwe're going to have 150 in there.\\nSo 150.\\nAnd then what we're going to do is we're going to click on OK,\\nand there's our employee name attribute there.\\nJust pick a point about there.\\nThat's fine for this particular block.\\nAnd then we're going to right click and Repeat ATTDEF.\\nWe're going to create another one,\\nbut we're going to tick this little box here,\\nAlign below previous attribute definition.\\n\\nNow, as soon as you do that,\\nyour Insertion Point and Text Settings gray out\\nbecause it's using the same one.\\nSo, we're going to have the employee, employee number.\\nSo we'll have EMP_NO, like that.\\nThe prompt will be employee number.\\nAnd again, that is a physical prompt\\nas if you are writing it.\\nAnd then the default there, employee number,\\nwe'll go for 9999.\\nAnd as you can see, that's all grayed out.\\nAlign below is ticked.\\nClick on OK, and it drops it in there like so.\\n\\nWe'll right-click again\\nand we'll repeat ATTDEF one more time\\nto bring up the Attribute Definition dialog box.\\nRemember, invisible is unticked and you want to align below.\\nSo tick that box.\\nYou have to do it each time, remember?\\nNow, last but not least,\\nwe'll have employee extension number.\\nSo you can see where the format's going with that.\\nAnd again, prompt will be employee extension.\\nMake sure you spell extension right,\\nI'm terrible for spelling that word.\\nAnd the default there might be, I don't know,\\nlet's go for 123.\\n\\nAgain, because we're aligning,\\nand that's ticked, Insertion Point,\\nText Settings are all grayed out.\\nSo we click on OK, and there's our three there, like so.\\nNow, those are just attributes placed in a random location.\\nYou might use some object snaps,\\nsome spacings there to get it nice, and neat, and tidy.\\nSo now, staying on the Insert tab on the ribbon,\\nwe go to create block.\\nSo we click on the fly out here.\\nMake sure we click on create block.\\nNow, the name of this is going to be Workstation_ATTR\\nso that we know it's got attributes.\\n\\nI'm going to go to the pick point icon here.\\nUse that corner of the desk there.\\nSelect the objects.\\nRemember like we did when we created a block previously?\\nAnd I'm going to select everything.\\nSo this is all the bits\\nthat make up the block and the attributes.\\nSo I'm going to click there,\\ncrossing selection go all the way through and over,\\njust to make sure I've got everything.\\nAnd then once I've got everything selected, press Enter.\\nThere's our little preview,\\nthere's our weird X and Y values.\\nAnd we're going to select Delete\\nin the Block Definition dialog like we've done previously.\\n\\nMake sure that you scale uniformly.\\nMake sure that you allow exploding\\nso that you can explode the block,\\nmake some changes to the block,\\nand perhaps create slightly different block out of it.\\nBlock units will be millimeters.\\nMake sure that Open in block editor is unticked.\\nI've used the block editor recently.\\nI just want to make sure that that's unticked.\\nClick on OK, and everything disappears.\\nNow, we're going to go to the Home tab on the ribbon,\\ngo to the Layer fly out here on the Layers panel.\\n\\nAnd you want to make sure\\nthat you're on the Workstations layer\\nso that when you bring the block in now,\\nit'll go onto the Workstations layer.\\nSo we go back to the Insert tab on the ribbon.\\nWe go to here, click on Insert, use the slider bar.\\nThere's workstation attributes there.\\nClick on it, pop it into the drawing,\\nand left-click somewhere in the space there,\\nand then you get prompted\\nfor employee extension, number, and name.\\nI'm going to leave them as they are,\\nas the defaults that we set up in the attributes.\\nClick on OK, and there is my block\\nwith attributes all set up in my AutoCAD drawing.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2027344\",\"duration\":202,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Working with the Enhanced Attribute Editor

[Instructor] We're moving into working\\nwith some tables in more depth in AutoCAD now.\\nWhat we're going to take a look at is\\nhow we create a new table style,\\nplace the table in the drawing,\\nand extract data from the drawing\\nand place it into the table.\\nNow, we haven't done that before\\nand it's utilizing a thing called Fields in AutoCAD.\\nAnd as we work through the next few videos you'll see\\nhow that data can be brought out of the drawing\\nand put into the table.\\n\\nNow, the drawing we've got for you\\nis called Simple Objects.dwg.\\nYou know the drill by now.\\nYou can download it from the library\\nto follow along with the videos.\\nNow, when you get the drawing open\\nmake sure you're in the Model tab.\\nYou should be able to see a rectangle,\\na circle, and a hexagon.\\nAnd also on the Layer dropdown,\\njust make sure you're using the Tables layer\\nas your current layer.\\nNow, the first thing we need to do is develop\\na simple table style.\\nNow, personally I like to do that\\nfrom the Annotate tab on the ribbon.\\n\\nYou can, however, work from the Annotation dropdown here\\non the Home tab on the ribbon.\\nThere you go, there's Table Style there.\\nI'm going to go to the Annotate tab,\\nand I've got my Tables panel here.\\nAnd I'm going to click on that arrow there,\\nand that will take me into Table Style.\\nNow, we want a new table style so we'll click on New.\\nThe name of it will be Shape Areas, like so.\\nYou can see where we're going with this.\\nWe're going to take the areas of the shapes in the drawing\\nand put them into the table.\\n\\nNow, we're going to start with Standard\\nbecause that's the only one we've got to start with,\\nclick on Continue, and you can see there\\nthat we go into the Table Style,\\nthe Shape Areas Table Style.\\nNow, Table direction, at the moment the title is at the top.\\nIf I set that to Up,\\ncan you see the title ends up at the bottom?\\nSo, you can tweak your table up or down with data.\\nI prefer the Down option with the title at the top.\\nNow, we've got three default cell styles,\\nData, Header, Title.\\n\\nYou can, however, create a new cell style\\nor manage cell styles.\\nYou can do that from there, from the dropdown,\\nor you can go here and create a new cell style there\\nand manage your cell styles there if you want to.\\nWe're just going to stick with our three, Data, Header, Title.\\nNow, select Title from the dropdown,\\nand you can see we've got three tabs,\\nGeneral, Text, and Borders.\\nNow, you can have a fill color, you can have an alignment,\\nthe format is General.\\nIf I click there you'll see\\nthat I can change the Table Cell Format.\\n\\nI can make it a date, a decimal number, and so on.\\nWe just want General in this case, that's fine,\\nso we'll OK it.\\nAnd it's going to be a Label.\\nNow, it could also be Data,\\nbut in this case it's just going to be a Label.\\nAnd Middle Center is the good alignment,\\nand we're going to change the margins a bit here\\nto suit the drawing.\\nSo, I'm going to make these 25, hit the Tab key,\\n25 again, hit the Tab key.\\nNow, you'll notice the preview starts to look a bit odd.\\nDon't panic, we're going to go to the Text tab\\nand we're going to use the Standard text style,\\nand we're going to set the text height to 150.\\n\\nNow, if you press Tab after putting 150 in\\nyou'll see that update and it looks much better.\\nText color I always use ByLayer\\nbecause then you're putting all of those text colors\\ninto the table from the Tables layer.\\nText angle zero, and Borders there.\\nYou can leave all of them as they are.\\nSo, that's your first cell style sorted.\\nLet's go to the dropdown, we're going to go to Header now.\\nNow, again, General tab here, Fill color none,\\nAlignment Middle Center, General, and Label.\\n\\nSet your margins again to 25, Tab, and then 25, Tab.\\nAnd you'll see that update accordingly,\\ncan you see it update there?\\nBut now we need to go to Text, Standard text style,\\nbut we're going to change text height to 125.\\nWhen you press Tab after that 125 value\\nyou'll see it all start to update in the preview\\nand look a lot more sensible.\\nAgain, text color is going to be ByLayer, text angle zero.\\nThe Borders can remain by default as they are.\\nLast but not least, we're going to go to Data\\nand go to the General tab.\\n\\nFill color None, Alignment is Top Center for Data.\\nI don't know why it does that.\\nI prefer it Middle Center, but by default it's Top Center.\\nThe Format is General, as you can see, but that's okay.\\nWe can leave it as General,\\nand it's just going to be Data rather than a Label.\\nSo, can you see, you can change it there Data to Label.\\nHorizontal and Vertical, again,\\nwe change to 25 for the margins.\\nAnd if you hit Tab each time\\nyou can see that Tab accordingly,\\nand it all starts to make sense in the preview there.\\n\\nText tab, again, Text style Standard,\\nText height will be 100 for the data.\\nAnd if you Tab that again you'll see that update,\\nand now the table looks sensible.\\nText color ByLayer, Text angle zero for horizontal,\\nand the Borders all remain by default as they are.\\nSo, now you've created your Shape Areas table.\\nClick on OK, and as you can see,\\nit adds it to the list on the left.\\nSelect Shape Areas there,\\nclick on Set Current to make it the current style.\\n\\nAs you can see, Current Tablestyle Shape Areas,\\nclick on Close, and when you look up\\nat your Tables panel here on the Annotate tab\\non the ribbon Shape Areas is your current table style.\\nSo, now you've inserted your table style into your drawing,\\nthe next step is to start creating the table itself\\nand adding the data from the drawing into the table.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4001130\",\"duration\":315,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Designing a

It doesn't matter.\\nBoth of them work in the same way.\\nI'll hit escape a couple of times,\\nclick once in the rectangle area cell like that.\\nI'm going to go up to the insert panel here and click on field.\\nNow as soon as I do that,\\nyou'll get a weird dialogue box appear.\\nNow you'll notice there it says field at the top.\\nIt is the field dialogue box.\\nThe important one is the field category.\\nClick on the fly out there.\\nAnd you want objects, like so.\\n\\nNow this is where you start honing down that big list\\nof fields that are available.\\nAnd you'll see right at the bottom you have\\nobject like that.\\nNow at the moment, there's no properties available\\nbecause we haven't selected an object type.\\nClick on this little button here, select object,\\nand then you go click on the rectangle.\\nAnd as you can see, now it's a polyline.\\nAnd the property that we want is the area.\\nThere's other properties\\nthat we can bring into the table if we want to.\\nNow the preview there is\\n812500.0000.\\n\\nNow we don't want that.\\nWe don't want that current precision.\\nSo we are going to take that to no decimal places.\\nWe override the unit's precision in the drawing like so,\\n'cause we only need the whole number.\\nNow there are additional formats available.\\nWe can convert things, we can have prefixes, suffixes.\\nI'm not going to worry about that, but just make sure your\\nprecision there has no decimal places.\\nWhen I click on okay, that value goes into\\nthat cell in the table.\\nNow if I just hit escape a couple of times now\\nand click away, can you see there that obviously\\nthat has got like a gray background to it,\\nthat's letting me know that it's field data\\nand it's related to an object in the drawing.\\n\\nSo let's do the same with the circle.\\nClick once in the cell up\\nto field there on the insert panel.\\nAnd you'll notice it remembers objects.\\nSo all I've got to do is go over here, select object,\\nclick on the circle, it remembers the precision\\nas well, which is great.\\nSo I click on okay, and it adds that value as well.\\nI can click once into this cell now as well.\\nNow you'll notice when I'm clicking, I can't do anything.\\nLook at the command line.\\nWe are currently in edit table cell.\\n\\nSo in order to get out of this, I need\\nto basically hit escape a couple of times,\\nlike that just to cancel it.\\nAnd then that makes life a bit easier.\\nI can click once in the cell again, go up to field again,\\nobject, select object.\\nYou're going to select the hexagon this time.\\nAnd again, there's the little preview of the area.\\nClick on okay, hit escape a couple of times to come out\\nof edit table cell.\\nAnd you can see there now that you've got your areas\\nof each of your shapes.\\nNow that background masking is really important\\nbecause it lets you know that it's field data.\\n\\nDon't worry about it showing up when you plot your drawing.\\nIt won't. It doesn't.\\nIt's called background masking\\nand it doesn't show up when you plot a drawing.\\nNow last but not least, we need to be able\\nto calculate the total area of our three simple objects.\\nHow do we do that?\\nWell, we can click once in this cell,\\nthe total area cell.\\nAnd again, we're in the table cell contextual tab.\\nIf we go up here to the insert panel, again, you can see\\nthat we have formula.\\nNow we have some simple formulas, very similar to\\nwhat you might use in something like Microsoft Excel.\\n\\nWe're going to go for sum,\\nas in we're going to add them up, we're going to sum them up.\\nAnd then you just literally click\\nand drag over the three cells like that.\\nClick again. And you've selected those three cells.\\nSo it's click once drag,\\nclick again, over those three cell values.\\nAnd you'll see, now hang on, there's an equation\\nequals the sum of B3 to B5.\\nThere's column B, B3 to B5\\njust like Microsoft Excel.\\nNow if I go up here\\nand close the text editor, the magic happens.\\n\\nAnd as you can see, it gives me the total value.\\nBut can you see there as well,\\nthe precision needs to change.\\nSo if I click once in that cell,\\nwhat I've got to do is change my data format\\nhere, cell format.\\nAnd what we'll do, we'll go to custom table cell format\\nand we just need to change it from current precision\\nto no decimal places.\\nClick on, okay and then it matches the other\\ncells in the table.\\nAnd again, just hit escape a few times\\nand you've now got the area of each of your shapes.\\n\\nNow I'll just show you something very cool here,\\nthat's very clever actually.\\nIf I select my rectangle and I click on that grip there\\nand make it a bit bigger like that,\\nthat shape is now bigger.\\nIf I hit escape a couple of times to deselect it\\nand then type regen to regenerate the drawing,\\nkeep an eye on the area for rectangle in the table,\\nit updates and the total area updates as well.\\nHow cool is that?\\nSo I've got shapes in my drawing that when I change them\\nand I regenerate the drawing, the table updates for me.\\n\\nAnd that's what that field data is all about.\\nIf I just undo that\\nand go back to my regular shape there,\\nnotice it doesn't regenerate automatically.\\nYou just type regen for regenerate.\\nYou can also save the drawing and it'll regenerate.\\nAnd again, it updates back to where we were before.\\nSo that's why you want\\nto use tables in your AutoCAD drawings.\\nIt allows you to tabulate your data,\\nbut more importantly extract data from the drawing\\nthat you can use in a real time environment.\\n\\nAs you can see, they want to change the area of the rectangle.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"14.

[Lecturer] We're starting a new chapter now\\nand we're going to be taking a look at working with\\nexternal reference files or XRefs for short.\\nAnd an external reference file or external reference drawing\\nor XRef is a virtual paperclip to drawing that you attach\\nto your existing host drawing.\\nSo basically then you've got the information from the XRef\\nand your host drawing so that you can see what's going on.\\nOne of the other benefits is if you've got an XRef file\\nattached to your drawing,\\nsomebody can work on that XRef as well and update it.\\n\\nAnd then when you refresh that connected XRef,\\nyou've got the updated data attached\\nto your host drawing as well.\\nNow we've got two drawings for you.\\nWe've got this one that you can see on the screen,\\nwhich is New Office Proposal.dwg,\\nand you've also got this one, Landscaping Area.\\nNow Landscaping Area is another separate DWG file.\\nMake sure you download both files\\nand put them in the same folder.\\nNow there's a reason for that\\nand I'll explain that in a minute.\\n\\nMake sure that your current drawing\\nis the New Office Proposal drawing.\\nThen we're going to go to the Home tab on the ribbon\\nand just make sure that you're using\\nthe XRefs layer as your current layer.\\nNow the reason we're doing that is we obviously want\\nthe XRef to come in on its own layer in the drawing.\\nThat's why we've got the XRefs layer.\\nNow I'm going to go to the Insert tab on the ribbon here.\\nAnd you'll notice we have a reference panel\\nwhere we can attach, clip, adjust, and so on.\\nNow I need you to click on this little arrow here\\non the reference panel.\\n\\nThat'll open up your external references palette.\\nNow you can see your drawing.\\nThere's your New Office Proposal drawing there,\\nyour current drawing.\\nNow what we need to do is attach\\nour Landscaping Area drawing.\\nNow you can attach a drawing that's already open,\\nand then what happens is AutoCAD will prompt you\\nto let you know if any changes\\nto that drawing have been made.\\nSo if I go up here to the top left corner\\nand click on the fly-out, you can see that I can attach\\nlots of different file types.\\nSelect Attach DWG, and you'll see there\\nthat that takes me to the folder\\nwhere my drawings are right now.\\n\\nSo I've got Landscaping Area.dwg,\\nand I've got New Office Proposal.dwg in the same folder.\\nThey must be in the same folder.\\nIgnore the complete ones.\\nThose are my completed drawings that I use\\nfor reference when I'm recording your courses.\\nSo I want landscaping area.\\nI click on Open.\\nAnd then the Attach External Reference dialogue box appears.\\nNow there's a lot of different settings in here.\\nA lot of them you won't even need to change, okay?\\nSo reference type is attachment like so.\\n\\nYou don't need to worry about overlay.\\nIt's just a basic attachment at the moment.\\nScale, leave all of that set to one.\\nInsertion point, make sure it's unticked,\\nand the X, Y, and Z, even though we're not using Z,\\nwe're in a flat 2D drawing,\\njust make sure they're all set to zero.\\nNow the path type, this is the important bit\\nwhy they're in the same folder.\\nIf I click on the fly-out there, you've got three options.\\nYou've got no path, relative path, or full path.\\nNow relative path is the one that you're going to use.\\nAnd relative path let's AutoCAD know that the two files,\\nthe host drawing and the XRef drawing\\nare in the same folder.\\n\\nSo make sure you've got relative path set\\nand the two files are in the same folder.\\nRotation angle zero is horizontal, that's fine.\\nAnd the block unit, it's already picked that up.\\nIt's in millimeters.\\nSo if I now click on OK, you'll see that\\nthe Landscaping Area pops in there\\nnext to our New Office Proposal.\\nSo what we've done is we've information\\nfrom the Landscaping Area drawing\\nand we've virtually paper clipped it\\nto Our new Office Proposal.\\n\\nYou'll notice it's there, Landscaping Area,\\nit's loaded, it's an attachment.\\nAnd that little dot and that little slash there,\\nLandscaping Area.dwg, lets me know that it's relative\\nand it's in the same folder\\nas the New Office Proposal drawing.\\nSo I can now close the external references palette.\\nAnd if I click on this,\\nit's all one object, it's a reference as you can see.\\nExternal reference tab kicks in on the ribbon\\nand there's tools there for me to work\\non that external reference file.\\n\\nNow we'll go into some of those\\nas we work through this chapter.\\nJust hit a couple of times on the Escape key\\nto deselect the XRef that is attached\\nto the New Office Proposal drawing.\\nAnd we'll move into the next video\\nand we'll start working with XRefs in our AutoCAD files.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3997350\",\"duration\":181,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Altering and clipping XREFs attached to an

It's not.\\nWhat you're doing is you're communicating your design\\nin your DWG file to someone so that they can read it,\\nthey can look at it, they can visualize from it,\\nbut more importantly they understand it.\\nThey grasp the concept of your design.\\nNow for this chapter, we've got a new drawing for you,\\nit's called GF, which stands for ground floor\\nand then it's 1031 Southeast Madison.\\n\\n1031 Southeast Madison\\nis the address of the new project,\\nso it's on Southeast Madison,\\nand it's building number 1031, and GF is ground floor.\\nDownload that from the library\\nto follow along with the videos in this chapter.\\nNow we're going to start in the model tab\\nand we do jump around a bit between model tab and layout tab\\nin this particular instance.\\nBut what we've got to do is design\\na simple title block that we can utilize,\\nand then what we're going to do with that title block\\nis move it into a layout tab\\nand develop a page set up around it.\\n\\nSo make sure layers panel home tab on the ribbon,\\nmake sure you're on the title block layer.\\nWe've got title block, title text.\\nWe're going to be using both of those,\\nbut we want title block first.\\nAnd then zooming and panning,\\njust zoom in so that you're kind of right here.\\nCan you see sort of top left corner\\nof the ground floor plan?\\nAnd we're going to draw a rectangle.\\nSo draw panel, click on the flyout, rectangle,\\npick a point about here, and drag upwards to the right.\\nNow I am working in metric millimeters\\nbecause I'm in the UK.\\n\\nThis would be different if you were working in the US\\nin inches and imperial.\\nSo I'm going to be using metric millimeters\\nthroughout this chapter.\\nYou will need to convert to inches, imperial, et cetera.\\nAnd also sheet sizes.\\nI'll be using European UK sheet sizes.\\nYou'll need to convert those to US sheet sizes, for example.\\nNow I'm going to type in 841 as the length of the rectangle,\\nthen I'm going to tab, and then the other one is 594.\\n\\nNow they are millimeters I hasten to add,\\nso it's quite a diddy little rectangle at the moment.\\nI'm going to press enter to confirm\\nand then I'm going to zoom in on that rectangle,\\nget it nice, front and center there on the screen.\\nNow we're going to develop a really simple title block.\\nNow in order to do this, we need to use a bit of offsetting,\\nbit of text, bit of textiles, and so on.\\nYou'll see what happens.\\nI'm going to go to offset on the modify panel, there's offset,\\nand the offset distance initially, 20.\\n\\n2-0, press enter.\\nI'm going to select my rectangle, click on it, and move inside.\\nCan you see there's outside, orange on the outside,\\norange on the inside.\\nSo the orange rectangle is the offsetted rectangle,\\nIf you get what I mean.\\nMake sure you are inside.\\nThe original rectangle is that purple one you can see.\\nSo orange on the inside, left click.\\nPress enter to confirm.\\nWe're going to right click and repeat offset,\\nset a distance this time of 10, and press enter.\\n\\nSelect the inner rectangle that you've just created,\\nclick on it, move inside again.\\nRemember orange on the inside, not the outside.\\nLeft click and enter to finish.\\nSelect the two inner rectangles that you've created,\\nthese two here, up to the modify panel and click on explode.\\nThat explodes them from rectangles, polylines,\\nto their original line segments.\\nSo you are now going to select\\n1, 2, 3, those three there.\\n\\nRight click and erase.\\nWe are then going to go back to offset,\\nup here on the modified panel.\\nThis time the offset distance will be 3-0, 30,\\nand you're going to select the middle line.\\nCan you see? Not that one, not that one.\\nThat's a poly line, anyway.\\nIt's that one you want there.\\nClick on it, move upwards,\\nclick again to offset, and to finish.\\nNow this line left in here, we're going to use as a guide\\nfor our title block text.\\n\\nTalking of text, we need to create some text styles.\\nUp to the annotation fly out here,\\nclick on the A with the paintbrush.\\nThat will open up the text style dialogue blocks.\\nWe're going to click on new.\\nAnd our first new textile will be Title_LAYOUT.\\nMake sure you spell it right.\\nThere's nothing worse than a misspelled textile.\\nAnd then underscore again and 10 mm for millimeters.\\nClick on okay. So there's Title_LAYOUT_10.\\n\\nNow the font at the moment is that one preview there,\\nnot nice.\\nThat's an old SHX style font.\\nWe want to use a nice true type font.\\nSo we're going to click on the flyout,\\nand little trick here,\\nyou can do this in any Windows based application\\nin a dropdown menu like this.\\nIf I now type C on the keyboard,\\nit'll take me to the first font that begins with C.\\nAnd that's good because Calibri's right there\\nand that's the one I need.\\nSo Calibri there and I'm going to go for bold italic\\nas the style, like that.\\n\\nHeight of that will be 10,\\nas per the name of the textile, 10 millimeters.\\nAll of the effects we leave as they are.\\nWe don't need upside down, backwards,\\nwidth factor, or anything like that.\\nWe click on apply.\\nSo that is our Title_LAYOUT_10 millimeter set.\\nWe're going to click on new again,\\nthis time we're going to create another textile, Notes,\\nN-O-T-E-S, underscore LAYOUT, again.\\nMake sure you spell it right.\\nI'm not having a good day with spelling \\\"layout\\\" today,\\nas you can see.\\nUnderscore, and then 3.5 millimeters.\\n\\nClick on okay.\\nNow that will adopt the settings\\nthat the Title_LAYOUT_10 millimeters had.\\nClick on Notes_LAYOUT_3.5.\\nWe're going to change the font style back to regular\\nand change the height back to 3.5,\\nas per the name of the text style.\\nClick on apply.\\nThey're now both applied to the styles list.\\nSelect Title_LAYOUT_10 millimeters.\\nClick on set current, click on close.\\nIf you click on your little flyout now,\\nTitle_LAYOUT_10 millimeters is your current text style.\\n\\nGo up to the text flyout on the annotation panel\\nand select single line text.\\nAnd then we're going to zoom in on the lower left corner\\nof our title block.\\nNow we're going to right click\\nand we're going to go to just justify.\\nYou want to be justifying to the left,\\nwhich is the default anyway.\\nAnd then the endpoint snap on this line here\\nwill be the first point of our text.\\nClick there, move away,\\nand the rotation angle of the text is going to be zero.\\nWe want it horizontal. So zero for horizontal.\\n\\nPress enter to confirm.\\nAnd there's our little cursor.\\nNow we're going to type in here Ground Floor Plan, like so.\\nPress enter once, press enter twice.\\nThat closes out the single line text command.\\nZoom out a little bit, pan across a little bit\\nto the right corner of the little text box there.\\nCan you see bottom right corner of the title block.\\nAgain up to text here, select single line on the flyout,\\nright click and justify.\\n\\nAnd you're going to go right. Select the right justification.\\nIt asks now for the right end point of the text baseline.\\nSo we go to the end point snap on the other end of the line,\\nleft click, move away, and it'll ask you\\nfor the rotation angle again.\\nZero is fine. Prints to confirm.\\nThere's our little flashing cursor.\\nNow this is where AutoCAD gets clever.\\nBecause you've put a right justification in,\\nit's going to justify from the right hand side\\ninstead of the sort of default left hand side.\\nSo I'm just going to type in here, LinkedIn Learning, like so.\\n\\nThere you go. Enter once, enter twice.\\nAnd as you can see,\\nit's justified to the right hand end of the line.\\nIf you zoom out a little now\\nand bring that sort of front and center,\\nit looks like a pitch frame\\nand you've got your simple title block.\\nWhat we're going to do, we're going to select this line here,\\nwe don't need it anymore.\\nRight click erase.\\nThere we go.\\nThe text looks really nice now\\nin that little bounding box at the bottom.\\nNow go up to the annotation flyout and select textiles here.\\nAnd on the dropdown there,\\nyou now want your Notes_LAYOUT_3.5.\\n\\nThere it is there.\\nSo that is now your current text style.\\nAnd a little trick to remember,\\nwe've put those bits of text in.\\nThey're not actually on the title text layer.\\nSo I need to select these two here\\n'cause they're on the title block layer at the moment.\\nWe need to go down our layers here.\\nTitle text, remember? Not title block.\\nHit escape a couple of times to deselect those.\\nAnd then make sure that your current drafting layer\\nis title text to place our notes up here\\nin the top right corner.\\n\\nSo zoom in a bit again\\nand we're going to go up to the annotation panel,\\nclick on the flyout, and select multi-line text.\\nAnd then just click as if you're placing a rectangle.\\nSo it's click, drag, click.\\nAnd as you can see the little ruler kicks in,\\nas you can see there.\\nWe're in our text editor tab,\\nthe contextual tab on the ribbon, using multi-line text.\\nIf you want to zoom in a bit, you can. There you go.\\nAnd I'm going to type in NOTES in caps, like that,\\nwith a colon after it.\\n\\nI'm going to press enter, takes me to the next line of text\\nin the multi-line text area that I've specified.\\nNow, one of the really neat new features\\navailable in later versions of AutoCAD is\\nif I type one and put a dot\\nand then press the space bar,\\ncan you see it automatically starts numbering\\nand paragraphing in for me,\\njust like Microsoft Word does.\\nReally useful.\\nSo I'm going to put here all dimensions are in millimeters,\\nand I'm spelling millimeters of the UK way.\\n\\nObviously if we're in America,\\nthat would be E-R-S rather than R-E-S.\\nPress enter again and you'll notice\\nit puts the next number in for me,\\njust like it would in a Word document.\\nAnd I'll put something like do not dimension\\nfrom the drawing,\\n'cause you don't normally dimension from a drawing,\\nyou normally dimension on site\\nand then commit that information to the drawing.\\nOnce you've done that, just click away from the text,\\nzoom out slightly, you can see that your notes\\nare a little bit too far away there.\\n\\nSo maybe what we could do is bring this in a little bit,\\nlike that, click on the arrow, and click there,\\nand then click on this grip here,\\nand just move that a little bit further along to there.\\nHit escape to deselect.\\nZoom out slightly, front and center,\\nand you can see you now have a simple title block\\nready to use.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4001124\",\"duration\":370,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Defining your page setup in your AutoCAD drawings\",\"fileName\":\"4261301_en_US_17_02_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":378,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"Please ensure that ALL references to AutoCAD Watt Beta are REMOVED/FADED in THIS chapter!

Click on OK.\\nAnd it will tell me now that I can't use that printer.\\n\\nThat is absolutely fine. We don't need that printer.\\nAnd that's just a printer that's in my office\\nand it's trying to connect to it.\\nThat printer isn't around anymore, it's out of use.\\nSo I'm going to click on OK.\\nDoesn't matter 'cause we're going to change\\nthe printer plotter here anyway in the page setup.\\nSo there's our page setup name.\\nPrinter plotter.\\nWe need a PDF page setup anyway,\\nso we're going to use a different printer plotter setup.\\nI'm going to go for AutoCAD PDF High Quality Print, like so.\\n\\nAnd there's your PC3 file,\\nyour plotter configuration file.\\nSo it's taking the DWG\\nto the PDF using the PDF ePlot driver by Autodesk.\\nWe now need to set our paper size.\\nNow we're working in landscape\\nand I'm going to scroll up using the slider bar here.\\nCan you see we've got all the ANSI sheets,\\nall the ISO sheets.\\nThere's lots and lots of different sheets, trust me.\\nI need to be looking for ISO.\\nSo I need ISO,\\nand I'm going to go for ISO Expand 841 by 594.\\n\\nISO Expand A1 841 by 594.\\nCan you see it's now a landscape orientation in the preview?\\nWhat to plot is going to be the extent.\\nSo what I want to do is I want to plot\\nto the extent of the sheet with the title blocks\\ncentered on top of that sheet.\\nSo I need to center the plot there.\\nI need to make sure that the scale is one to one,\\nbecause our title block is A1.\\nOur sheet is also A1.\\nPlot style table.\\n\\nJust select monochrome for now.

[Instructor] We're staying in our GF-1031\\nSoutheastMadison.dwg file.\\nAnd you can see at the moment\\nthat we are still in the ISO A1 landscape layout tab.\\nNow, we need to start thinking about placing\\nsome scaled viewports in the layout tab\\nso that we can start getting some scaled views\\nfrom the model tab onto our sheet,\\nready to communicate our design intent.\\nSo, in order to do that, go to the Home tab on the ribbon,\\ngo to the Layer Properties button on the Layers panel\\nand open up the Layer Properties Manager.\\n\\nNow, I'm just going to expand out the names of the layers there\\nso that we can see what we're doing, there we go.\\nAnd I'm also going to expand out the plot column\\nthere as well, there's a reason for that.\\nNow, if we scroll all the way down,\\nyou can use the wheel or the slider bar for this,\\nyou can see we have a viewports layer, like that.\\nThere's the viewports layer.\\nNow you'll notice there's a little no-entry symbol\\non the plotter in the plot column.\\nNow, that's telling AutoCAD\\nnot to plot the viewports layer.\\n\\nIt's like a little toggle.\\nIf I click on it, no entry symbol means that it will plot.\\nClick on it again.\\nNo entry symbol there means it will not plot.\\nWe don't want our viewports,\\nthe edges of our outlines of our viewports to plot.\\nThey're there for our reference.\\nOtherwise, you'll have all these big rectangles everywhere\\non your PDF when you actually plot the drawing out.\\nSo, make sure that viewports is there,\\nand it's set not to plot.\\nYou can leave the color and the line type and everything.\\nAnd if you double click on the little sheet\\nnext to viewports,\\nthat will make viewports the current layer.\\n\\nYou can see it there at the top\\nof the Layer Properties Manager.\\nSo close the Layer Properties Manager,\\nand you'll see in the layers panel,\\nviewports is the current layer.\\nNow we need to place some viewports\\nin the ISO A1 landscape layout tab.\\nBefore we do that, jump back to the model tab,\\ndouble click on the wheel in the model tab to zoom extents.\\nThere's our floor plan.\\nI've got to fit all of that floor plan\\ninto that itty bitty rectangle there.\\nThat's my title block.\\n\\nIf you zoom in, that is my title block.\\nI've got to fit it in there.\\nThat's why we use scaled viewports.\\nEverything in the model tab is drawn real life, real size.\\nThen we scale it in a viewport\\non our title block on our sheet\\nto communicate our design intent.\\nWe don't need the title block in the model tab anymore,\\nso just click there,\\ndrag a window selection over all of it so it's all selected,\\nright click and erase, like so.\\nDouble click on the wheel again to zoom extents.\\nIt's good CAD practice to do that\\nwhen you're jumping between model and layout.\\n\\nGet into the habit of zooming to extents\\neach time when you do that,\\njust so if somebody else opens a drawing later on,\\nthey can see what's going on.\\nSo, there is our floor plan.\\nWe need to get that to fit\\nonto our ISO A1 landscape layout tab.\\nSo let's jump back to the layout tab, ISO A1 landscape,\\nand we want to place a viewport in this space on the sheet.\\nWe're on the viewports layer, and what we need to do now\\nis go up to the layout tab on the ribbon,\\nnot the layout tab, bottom left,\\nbut the layout tab on the ribbon,\\nthe blue, contextual layout tab.\\n\\nIt will always appear\\nwhen you're in a layout tab in the drawing.\\nNow, looking at this,\\nyou can see we have a layout viewport panel.\\nAnd if I click on the fly out here,\\nI can have a rectangular, a polygonal,\\nor an object-based viewport.\\nAn object-based viewport, you draw a circle,\\nconverted to a viewport, for example.\\nWe're just going to use rectangular for the moment,\\nso click on rectangular,\\nand it'll ask you for the corner of your viewport.\\nNow this is just like drawing a rectangle\\nor a selection window.\\n\\nWhat we're going to do, we're going to come up here,\\ndon't go right into the corner to the end point now.\\nCome out slightly and then left click,\\ndrag your viewport like that,\\ntake it to about there and left click again.\\nWhat AutoCAD does is it now sizes everything\\nto fit that viewport from the model tab.\\nIt's, in essence, doing a zoom extents\\nin the viewport that you've just created.\\nNow that viewport at the moment is at a random scale.\\n\\nIt's not at a fixed scale.\\nSo what we need to do is double click\\ninside the boundary of the viewport.\\nSo get the cross there somewhere inside,\\ndouble click on the mouse.\\nCan you see the outline of the viewport goes bold?\\nYou'll also notice down here on the status bar,\\nit says model, even though you are in a layout tab,\\nbecause you're looking through that hole in your sheet\\nfrom your layout tab into the model tab.\\nNow, down here on the status bar,\\ncan you see I've got 0.011602 scale, not quite what we want.\\n\\nClick on the fly out there.\\nThere's all my scales that I can use.\\nNow, I want one to 100.\\nAnd can you see that resizes\\nto that fixed scale in the viewport?\\nNow you'll notice at the moment,\\nI've only got metric scales in there.\\nIf I go to custom, you'll see here if I do a reset,\\nthat will actually allow me to display\\nboth metric and imperial.\\nIf I click on Reset, can you see I've got a choice\\nof metric scales, imperial scales,\\nor metric and imperial scales.\\n\\nNow I'm just using metric,\\nbecause I'm working in millimeters.\\nIf you're in the USA, for example,\\nyou might use imperial scales\\nor a mixture of metric and imperial.\\nI'm going to cancel that, and I'm going to cancel that,\\n'cause I want one to 100\\nand I just want to see metric scales on my scales list,\\nso there's one to 100.\\nNow the good thing is, that's all set up nice and neatly,\\nso I can double click outside the viewport,\\nideally in the gray area past the sheet, like that.\\nI can click now on the viewport boundary\\nand the grips appear.\\n\\nIf I click on that grip there and bring it down,\\nI can resize it, and you can just resize around the view,\\njust gently clicking on the grips.\\nAnd then, the good thing is,\\nyou're kind of rationalizing the space\\nthat the viewport takes up.\\nWith the viewport still selected,\\nright click and select Move on the shortcut menu,\\npick the top-left corner\\nand just take it up a bit over to here.\\nNow you can move it around anyway you like.\\nI suggest about there. That's fine.\\nSo now we've got a nicely placed one to 100 viewport\\nin our title block.\\n\\nSelect the viewport down here to the status bar,\\nlock the viewport scale, always important to do that,\\nand then just hit escape a couple of times\\nto deselect that viewport.\\nNow you can have as many viewports as you like\\non your sheet.\\nI'm going to place another viewport now,\\nand this viewport is going to be at a different scale,\\nand we're going to zoom in to the restrooms on the floor plan.\\nSo I'm going to go back up to rectangular here, like so.\\n\\nThere's rectangular, and I'm going to click there,\\ndrag to about there and click again.\\nThere's another viewport.\\nCan you see it zoom to extents in that viewport as well?\\nI'm going to double click inside the viewport.\\nAs you can see, it goes bold, like so,\\nand then I'm going to zoom in on the restrooms.\\nCan you see the restrooms there? Like that.\\nSo there's the restrooms in that particular viewport.\\nAgain, we've got a weird scale.\\nCan you see that there? Nort 0.26163.\\nI'm going to go for one to 40.\\n\\nThat fits quite nicely in that viewport, one to 40 works.\\nExperiment with the scales.\\nIf I went to one to 50, that's a little bit too small.\\nSo one to 40, could we get one to 30 in there?\\nA little bit too big, so one to 40 is the one that works.\\nSo let's go with one to 40. That works fine.\\nDouble click outside the viewport,\\nclick on the edge of the viewport, make sure you padlock it\\nso that that viewport scale is locked down.\\nHit escape now, just to deselect the viewport.\\n\\nAnd as you can see now,\\nthis is how you develop your drawings\\nto communicate your design intent\\nusing those scaled view ports in your layout tabs.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3997351\",\"duration\":264,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using annotative scaling in your AutoCAD drawings\",\"fileName\":\"4261301_en_US_17_04_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":271,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"Please ensure that ALL references to AutoCAD Watt Beta are REMOVED/FADED in THIS chapter!

1-to-100, and that's what was used,\\nthat annotation scale when these dimensions were placed,\\nthese annotative dimensions.\\nNotice the triangle next to the dimension style.\\nThat means it's an annotative dimension style.\\n\\nSo close the properties palette,\\nhit Escape to deselect.\\nNow we're going to just double click on the wheel\\nto zoom extents again,\\nand we're going to now place some dimensions in the restrooms\\nthat are going to display in the 1-to-40 viewport.\\nSo I now need to change my annotation scale here\\ndown on the status bar to 1-to-40.\\nGo up to your layer dropdown as well in your layers panel.\\nMake sure that you're using the dimension layer.\\nIt's this one here, A-010-D_DIM.\\n\\nSo make sure you're on the right layer for dimensions.\\nWe're then going to zoom in to the restrooms here like so.\\nAnd I'm just going to place some simple linear dimensions.\\nYou can see the cubicles there.\\nThere's the little sort of columns for the cubicles.\\nWe're just going to dimension those.\\nNow I'm going to do this straight off the annotation panel here\\non the home tab, on the ribbon.\\nThere's linear, click on the flyout,\\nthere's my dimension types.\\nI'm going to click on linear and using my object snaps,\\nI'm going to go endpoint to endpoint there,\\ntry and get the endpoint\\nand then just drag that out.\\n\\nYou can see it's a 940-wide cubicle.\\nNow we might want to do that\\nfor the next cubicle down as well.\\nLet's zoom in a bit.\\nWe'll do another linear.\\nYou can right click and repeat DIM linear if you want to.\\nSo I'm going from that endpoint and let's just pan up a bit\\nand we want that endpoint there.\\nThat one is only 902.\\nIf you want it to line in, again, aim for that endpoint\\non the previously placed dimension.\\nSo there's a couple of dimensions there that are in place.\\nAnd then last but not least, we'll do one more.\\n\\nSo we'll go right click, repeat DIM linear.\\nLet's go from that endpoint snap there,\\nand I'll take this one all the way to the wall.\\nSo we'll just get in there to that end point\\nor intersection there like that.\\nAnd then we'll come out a bit\\nand what we'll do, we'll line in\\nwith the end point of the previously placed dimensions,\\nso they're all nice and neat and in line.\\nNow if I just double click on the wheel now to zoom extents,\\nyou'll see that we've got dimensions there\\nand dimensions there,\\nand we've got a 1-to-40 annotation scale.\\n\\nLet's go to the ISO A1 landscape layout tab.\\nWhat do you notice about the two viewports?\\nThe 1-to-100 annotative dimensions display\\nin the 1-to-100 viewport.\\nThe 1-to-40 annotative dimensions display\\nin the 1-to-40 viewport.\\nSo because you're using the appropriate annotation scale\\nfor your annotative dimensions in the model tab,\\nthey then display in the appropriate viewports\\nin the layout tab.\\n\\nThat's how you utilize annotative dimension annotation\\nusing an annotative dimension style.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2029139\",\"duration\":248,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Printing and plotting your AutoCAD

new title block\\nin our nice new layout, with the page setup and so on.\\nAnd we could set that up,\\nand the page setup was set to plot it out\\nto a nice PDF file.\\nI'm going to show you some alternative methods of plotting\\nand communicating your design intent.\\nNow we've got a new drawing for you for this chapter.\\n\\nIt looks remarkably familiar actually.\\nIt is the next iteration of the drawing\\nthat you used in the previous chapter.\\nSo it's GF-1031 Southeast Madison_REV1.dwg.\\nThe REV1 indicates revision one of the drawing.\\nNow in this particular video,\\nI'm going to show you how to plot from the model tab.\\nNormally, traditionally, you would plot from a layout tab,\\nbut sometimes when you're in the model tab,\\nyou just need a quick small sheet size plot of something\\nso that you can perhaps take it on site with you\\nto check dimensions and so on.\\n\\nSo I'm going to zoom in on the restrooms.\\nThere they are there in the drawing like so.\\nAnd I just want those restrooms on a small scale sheet,\\nnot to scale as such,\\nbut just so I can perhaps print it off on a paper,\\ntake it with me to site and actually write on the sheet\\nand write my notes on the sheet.\\nNow nowadays you can do that electronically\\nwith PDFs and so on.\\nSo what I'm going to do is I'm going to save it out as a PDF\\nwhen I plot from the model tab.\\nNow if I come down to the model tab in the drawing\\nand right click over it,\\nyou'll notice there's a plot option.\\n\\nI'm not going to worry about page setup manager,\\nI'm just going to click on plot.\\nNow you'll get the usual prompts like we had\\nin the previous chapter,\\nbecause we've got more than one layout tab.\\nJust select continue to plot on a single sheet.\\nYou don't have to keep this popping up either.\\nTick the box, and it won't show you this again.\\nNow the plot dialogue box\\nfor the model tab is exactly the same\\nas the plot dialogue box for the layout tabs.\\nWe just haven't got a page setup.\\nWe're not using a page setup.\\nNow at the moment,\\nmy OfficeJet Pro 9020.\\n\\nNow I'm going to click here\\nand go for a high quality print AutoCAD PDF.\\nAnd I'm going to select paper size.\\nAnd I've got every paper size going here\\nbecause I've got a PDF driver going on.\\nSo I'm going to scroll down a bit, and there's the ISO ones.\\nI need the metric ISO ones.\\nAnd I want an iso A4 210 by 297.\\nIt gives me kind of a portrait look to it.\\nNow the plot area in this case is going to be different.\\nI'm going to select window from the dropdown\\nand then I'm just going to click and drag\\nand place a window just roughly like that.\\n\\nAnd you can see there now, can you see that?\\nIt's trying to place it on the sheet.\\nNow as you can see, the window is set up there.\\nI'm going to center it on the sheet, click on center the plot.\\nWe want fit to paper.\\nIt's not going to be to scale at all.\\nYou just want it to fit on the sheet.\\nSo it's going to come up with custom,\\net cetera, et cetera in there.\\nPlot style table,\\nwe'll just set that to monochrome, black and white.\\nDo you want to assign this plot style table to all layouts?\\nNot really.\\nIt's just a one-off,\\nso I don't need to worry about it too much.\\n\\nAnd make sure here, sanity check,\\nyou want that to be portrait, remember?\\n'Cause it's portrait,\\nand the sheet orientation is also portrait.\\nSo if I now click on preview,\\ncan you see now I've got a little one-off sheet\\nthat is just scaled to fit\\nwith the restroom area on it?\\nI could now right click and plot,\\nand that would save it out as a PDF.\\nI'm just going to exit that preview for the moment.\\nBut you can see there that that's how quick and easy it is\\nto plot from the model tab.\\n\\nI'll click on cancel.\\nI don't need to actually plot that out,\\nso I'll click on cancel like so.\\nThat's how quick and easy it is to plot\\nfrom the model tab in

I can also set a transmittal file name.\\nIt'll prompt me for a file name and you can see it there.\\nGF 1031, Southeast Madison Rev 1-training.zip.\\nThat's what it's going to save it to.\\nWhat I'll do is I'll make sure\\nthat this zip file when I click on the button actually goes\\nto the exercise files folder so\\nthat you can download it and check it out.\\n\\nNow, we can use an organized folder structure,\\nor we can just place all the files in one folder,\\nor we can keep the files and folders as they are.\\nI'm going to place all the files in one folder like so.\\nNow, do you want to send an email with a transmittal?\\nIf you do tick that box,\\nwhat'll happen is it'll basically go\\nto your email client such as Outlook,\\nwhen you transmit using this transmittal setup.\\nI'm not going to worry about that. What I will do though is set\\nthe default plotter to none\\nbecause sometimes they might not have access\\nto the same plotter as you.\\n\\nIf there's any external references,\\nyou can bind or insert them into the drawing.\\nIt's sometimes a good idea to purge the drawings as well,\\nso they're not so heavy\\nand not so unwieldy from a file size perspective.\\nYou also might want to include fonts.\\nIf you've got some specific fonts that you've had designed\\nfor your organization, you might want to tick that.\\nI know that I haven't. I'm just using default fonts,\\nbut it's good to tick that to make sure that those fonts go\\nwith the drawing package.\\nAnd the other bits here, you don't need to worry about any\\nof these textures or data links or photometric web files.\\n\\nWe're not really using any of that,\\nbut it just default ticks them.\\nYou might want to include any unloaded file references,\\nunloaded external reference files, if that's the case.\\nWe can also have a transmittal setup description.\\nSo I'm going to call this my training setup set up, like so.\\nI'll click on, okay, and that is now there.\\nCan you see that training? So I'm going to use training.\\nI'll select it there and close,\\nand I can use training now as my transmittal setup.\\n\\nNow what we can do here is we can expand these out\\nand just see what information is in there.\\nAlso, you can do it in a table format.\\nIt's up to you which one you want to do.\\nI tend to prefer the tree look. It's easier to see.\\nAnd it relates more to something like Windows File Explorer.\\nSo we've got our drawing.\\nWe've got our gray scale CTB file,\\nand we've also got there, our PC3, our AutoCAD PDF,\\nhigh quality Print PC3 file.\\nThat's all attached in this transmittal.\\nI can add other files, word documents, Excel files if I want\\nto, and I can enter notes to include\\nwith this transmittal package,\\nsuch as, this'll be the AutoCAD\\n2026 essential training course.\\n\\nLet's make sure we spell that right. So there you go.\\nEssential training. Let's get that in there like that.\\nSo there you go, AutoCAD.\\nLet's take that extra zero out as well. There we go.\\nThat looks better.\\nSo we've got AutoCAD 2026 essential training.\\nSo when I click on okay now, what it'll do is it'll ask me\\nwhere do I want that file to go.\\nSo you can see there, it's saving out to a file.\\nNow you can give it a name.\\nIt takes on board the drawing name plus the name\\nof the transmittal setup.\\n\\nSo what I'm going to do, I'm going to put LIL in front like that,\\nLIL underscore.\\nSo I know that it's the LinkedIn learning zip file, like so.\\nSo when I click on save, it'll save that out.\\nThat's all done.

drawings.\\nNow, in this particular video we're going to take a look\\nat two drawings and utilize the DWG Compare tool.\\nNow, we've got two drawings open\\nand I'd like you to download both of these from the library\\nand open them up in AutoCAD.\\nSo you've got Simple Objects 001,\\nwhere you've got a rectangle, a circle, and a hexagon.\\n\\nWe've also got Simple Objects 002,\\nwhich only has the rectangle and the circle this time.\\nSo let's go back to Simple Objects 001.\\nIf I go to the collaborate tab on the ribbon,\\nDWG Compare is right there.\\nIf you want to compare the drawings, as you can see,\\nyou just type compare and press enter.\\nNow, what we are going to do, we're going to make a comparison\\nbetween the two drawings.\\nSo I click on DWG Compare\\nand it'll prompt me, which drawing do I want\\nto compare it to?\\nNow, at the moment,\\nour current drawing is Simple Objects 001.\\n\\nYou can tell by the bold in the file tab there.\\nSo we're going to compare this against Simple Objects 002,\\nthe one without the hexagon, click on open.\\nAnd what you'll find now is it goes\\ninto DWG Compare mode, so to speak.\\nAnd if I just click on the settings here\\nand just pin these open for a moment, you'll see based on\\nwhat you've got on the screen, how these settings work.\\nSo you'll notice we've got not in current drawing,\\nonly in current drawing,\\nand it'll also give you like a file length\\ndescription thing there.\\n\\nIf I hover over that,\\nit gives me a great big long file name.\\nJust ignore my long file names.\\nSo at the moment, the green is highlighting there\\nbecause it's only in the current drawing.\\nIn both the drawings though, we have the circle\\nand the rectangle, hence the gray, no differences.\\nThe revision cloud display is this yellow bit here\\nand it's locked as you can see,\\nand you can make it either polygonal or rectangular.\\nNot much difference in this particular case.\\nAnd we can change the size of it, we can make it bigger\\nand smaller if we need to like so.\\n\\nNotice you can also filter hatch\\nand text when you're doing a DWG Compare.\\nWhat's also really nice is you can turn these on\\nand off just like you can with layers\\nwith the little light bulb.\\nWhen it's yellow, it's on, when it's blue, it's off.\\nSo those are the settings.\\nSo I'm just going to unpin the settings like so,\\nand they'll go back into the DWG Compare toolbar here.\\nNow, notice at the moment,\\nthat I can turn on the comparison display\\nand I can also turn it off.\\n\\nThat's the comparison display there\\nwith our little rev cloud\\nand the green indicating that it's in this drawing only.\\nIf I click on this little arrow here, it'll take me to all\\nof the comparisons in the DWG file.\\nThere's only one, so when I click on that arrow again,\\nI can't go to any others.\\nThat's the only comparison we've got.\\nAnd that's the hexagon in this drawing\\nand it isn't in Simple Objects 002.\\nHere as well, you'll notice if I hover over this,\\nI can import objects from the compared drawing.\\n\\nNow, I can't do that this time\\nbecause the hexagon is in this drawing,\\nso I would need for the hexagon to be in another drawing\\nto bring it into this drawing.\\nI can also export out a comparison DWG file.\\nSo what it'll do is it'll put all of this revision cloud\\nand the colors and so on of the comparison\\nof the objects into a separate DWG file.\\nTo get out of DWG Compare,\\njust click on the cross on the toolbar\\nand you're back into the drawing again like so.\\n\\nSo I'll just zoom and pan and get those centered.\\nYou can also zoom\\nand pan when you are in DWG Compare as well.\\nNow, I'm going to do something slightly different.\\nWhat I'm going to do, I'm going to go\\nto Simple Objects 002 and make that the current drawing.\\nI'm then going to do DWG Compare again\\nand compare it this time to 001,\\nthe one with the hexagon in it.\\nClick on open\\nand what you'll find now is based on the settings,\\nlet's pin those open again,\\nyou'll see not in current drawing.\\n\\nThe red is highlighting here now.\\nIt's letting me know that\\nthat hexagon is not in this drawing.\\nNotice everything else looks very much the same,\\nbut what I can do now is I can bring it in\\nfrom the other drawing.\\nSo if I now import the objects from the compared drawing,\\nit'll bring that in.\\nSo I select the hexagon, press enter to confirm,\\nthat is now in the drawing.\\nCan you see they've all gone gray?\\nSo that indicates that they are now in both drawings.\\nAnd if I now close the DWG Compare,\\nI've brought the hexagon in to Simple Objects 002.\\n\\nIf I go back to Simple Objects 001,\\nthere's a hexagon in there as well.\\nHow cool is that? It's very useful.\\nSo I'll go back to Simple Objects 002\\nI'll select the hexagon, right click and erase it\\nso that we're back to where we were at the beginning.\\nSimple Objects 002 doesn't have the hexagon.\\nSimple Objects 001 does have the hexagon,\\nand that's how you can utilize DWG Compare\\nto compare objects in similar drawings.\\nThen you can see what's different.\\nIt's great for checking one revision\\nof a drawing against another revision of a drawing.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3997349\",\"duration\":238,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using the Count functionality to check the number of objects in an AutoCAD drawing\",\"fileName\":\"4261301_en_US_19_02_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":247,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"Please ensure that ALL references to AutoCAD Watt Beta are REMOVED/FADED in THIS chapter!

I can hit Escape to deselect as well.\\nSo you'll notice I've got various draw tools,\\nvarious annotation tools, various modify tools.\\nI've also got down here, I've got ONSAPS.

I've got ORTHO.\\nI can go into Polar there and set my angle if I want to.\\nAnd also, here, I can go into my layout tabs as well.\\nThere's my layout tabs there like so.\\nNow, you'll notice that things like fonts\\ntend to change a little bit.\\n\\nNow, the reason for that is they've standardized\\non the fonts to allow the browser\\nto work quickly and effectively.\\nI can go back there to the model tab.\\nI can also download the mobile version.\\nI can open it in my desktop if I want to,\\nand I can also share the file if I want to as well.\\nIt's incredibly useful.\\nUp here, I've got Save and Save As.\\nI've got Plot.\\nIf I go into settings,\\nI've got various settings like tracking,\\nsnap and grid, units, navigation,\\nall of that can be set up as well.\\n\\nSo there's a whole plethora of things that you can do\\nwith your AutoCAD drawing\\nwhen you're working in AutoCAD Web.\\nNow, the layout here is similar in the mobile version,\\nbut obviously it's cut down.\\nYou can't have a massive application like AutoCAD running\\nas it would on the desktop on a mobile device.\\nBut I have to say, I use AutoCAD Mobile on my iPad Pro\\nall the time, and it is a fantastic piece of kit.\\nIt's really good.\\n\\nWith the Apple pencil,\\nyou're actually drafting as if you're drawing on a notepad.\\nIt's really clever stuff.

Top left.\\n\\nNow I'm going to zoom in on the restrooms\\nand the zoom functionality is exactly the same.\\nCan you see that?\\nUsing the mouse, roll up and down on the mouse\\nto zoom in and out,\\nand hold down the wheel on the mouse to pan.\\nNow I'm going to zoom in on the restrooms\\nand I'm going to add a thing called a trace.\\nNow, traces are incredibly useful\\nbecause they kind of add a sheet of tracing paper\\non top of the drawing, and allow you to add information\\non that tracing paper that allows people to see things\\nthat aren't physically part of the actual DWG itself.\\n\\nIt's really, really clever technology,\\nand it's been brought into AutoCAD Web and AutoCAD mobile,\\nand then, it's been rolled out\\nto the AutoCAD desktop as well,\\nand we'll see that in a minute.\\nIf we go to traces,\\nover here on the left hand side of AutoCAD Web,\\nthere are no traces in the drawing at the moment.\\nIf I click on New Trace,\\nwhat it'll do now is it goes into trace mode.\\nBut before we do that, over here now, I've got trace one.\\nIt tells you who has actually worked on that trace,\\nit's me, and the time I'm working on the trace.\\n\\nYou've got the date as well, the space that it's in,\\nand everything else, and who it was last saved by,\\nand so on and so forth.\\nI can also jump between the trace and the drawing.\\nSo if I go into drawing now, can you see?\\nI'm still in trace, but I'm looking at the drawing.\\nIf I go to trace there,\\nand the trace view where the trace is,\\nI'll explain how that works in a minute.\\nLet's right click over here, and we'll rename the trace,\\nand we'll call this restrooms.\\nIn fact, we'll call it restrooms001, like that,\\nand I'll just press enter to rename that.\\n\\nCalling it trace one, not really that descriptive.\\nAnother thing you might want to do here as well\\nis if you've got different revisions of traces,\\nyou could actually add in that file name of the trace,\\nsomething like rev one or rev two.\\nNow what I'm going to do,\\nI'm going to use my layer drop down here.\\nYou can see I've got various layers available.\\nAs you can see, all the different layers in the drawing\\nare available, like so.\\nI'm just going to make sure I'm on the zero layer,\\nthe default zero layer for this.\\nAnd what I'm going to do,\\nI'm going to place a revision cloud around the restroom.\\n\\nSo there's rev cloud on the annotate panel there, rev cloud,\\nand what I can do, notice on the command line,\\nI've got the option of arc length, object,\\nrectangular, et cetera.\\nSo what I'm going to do here\\nis I'm going to create an arc length first.\\nIt's showing me there 1155.1758.\\nLet's change that value, shall we?\\nSo let's change that to say something simple, like 1200.\\nEnter, and then I'm going to go for a rectangular rev cloud,\\nclicking on there at the bottom.\\n\\nSo if I now click over here, there's my rev cloud,\\nclick there like that, job done.\\nNow that's in the trace mode.\\nIf I go to drawing, can you see there?\\nThe trace is now grayed out.\\nIf I go back to trace, I can then edit the trace.\\nIt just allows you to see what's going on in your drawing,\\nand what is in the drawing, and what is in the trace.\\nI'm also going to place some text.\\nSo I'll click there on the mtext,\\non the annotate part up at the top there.\\nAnd what I'm going to do now is place some text.\\nSo I'll pop it, say there, click,\\nand it's mtext in this case, by the way.\\n\\nAnd you'll notice there\\nthat we're using notes 3.5 millimeter as a style.\\nI'm going to go to aerial,\\nand I'm going to change that value there.\\nDefinitely, that's way too small. It doesn't matter.\\nWe'll edit that in a moment,\\nbut I'm just going to put something along the lines of check,\\nrestroom, configuration, or config.\\nLet's just say config with a dot, like that.\\nCheck restroom config.\\nNow if I tick that, you'll see the text is very, very small.\\nIt's just there.\\nSo if I select that now and go here to properties,\\ncan you see there's the mtext properties,\\nand the text height is 4.5.\\n\\nWant to make that a bit bigger,\\nlet's go say two, five, zero, and enter.\\nAnd you can see that's much bigger now.\\nSo if I go back to traces, and I'm happy with that,\\nI'll hit escape a couple of times.\\nCheck restroom config.\\nWhen I go into drawing, can you see that's grayed out?\\nIt's letting me know that that is part of the trace\\nand not part of the drawing.\\nSo there's our trace, it's all done.\\nIt's all in the drawing.\\nSo all I need to do now is save that drawing,\\nbut I need to come out of the trace setting.\\nSo I click on the cross, like that. The trace disappears.\\n\\nIt is still there, click there, there's the trace.\\nClose the trace, like that.\\nNow what I need to do is I need to save the drawing.\\nSo I'm just going to double click on the wheel\\nto zoom extents, good CAD practice, remember?\\nSo I'll click on save.\\nSo that is now saved. That drawing is now saved.\\nIt will always save back to the latest DWG file format,\\nso it'll save back to the 2018 DWG file format.\\nNow that's saved.\\nWhat you should do as well, just to be on the safe side,\\nis go up to here, can you see there my little mugshot?\\nI'm going to sign out just to avoid any complication there.\\n\\nSo you'll notice now, as I sign out, I get that,\\nand it's prompting me to sign in again,\\nand it takes me back to the default AutoCAD web webpage,\\nwhich is web.autocad.com.\\nSo you go to web.autocad.com to sign into your AutoCAD web.\\nSo that's done and we've saved the drawing.\\nThat drawing is now saved in the cloud.\\nWhat happens now when somebody using AutoCAD desktop\\nopens up that particular drawing?\\nLet's have a look at that in the next video.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2027342\",\"duration\":300,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using the Traces palette in AutoCAD desktop to collaborate on drawings\",\"fileName\":\"4261301_en_US_20_05_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":308,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"editingNotes\":\"Please ensure that ALL references to AutoCAD Watt Beta are REMOVED/FADED in THIS chapter!

[Instructor] We're back now\\nin the AutoCAD desktop application\\nand we're looking at our GF-1031 SE Madison_cloud.dwg file.\\nNow, this is the file that is still in the cloud.\\nI'm basically using the cloud as a big hard drive\\nand it's incredibly clever, incredibly useful\\nbecause it means\\nthat all of my files are accessible absolutely anywhere.\\nAnd that's what I love about the technology in AutoCAD now.\\n\\nIt's come along so much in the last few years\\nwith cloud, AI, machine learning,\\nsmart technology with your blocks and so on.\\nSo what we are going to look at now\\nare just a few more of the collaborative tools\\nthat are available in AutoCAD.\\nSo we're going to go to the collaborate tab on the ribbon.\\nNow over here, we have the ability\\nto share our drawings in the little share panel.\\nI can share a drawing or I can share views of my drawing.\\nNow when I click on share drawing,\\nit'll bring up this little dialogue box\\nand it's prompting me to share a link to my drawing.\\n\\nNow what'll happen here\\nis people can use this particular link\\nand they can open up the file in AutoCAD on the web\\nor AutoCAD on mobile.\\nIf you do view only,\\nobviously they can only view the drawing.\\nIf they do edit and save a copy,\\nthey can go in and edit and save a copy of the file\\nand actually make changes to it.\\nSo you see you get a big, long link\\neach time you send that link to somebody\\nand that link will expire in seven days.\\nNow, I'm not going to worry about previewing\\nor copying the link or anything like that.\\n\\nIt's a really, really simple process.\\nYou simply click on share drawing\\nand you send it either as view only,\\nor edit and save a copy.\\nAnd basically that will be\\nin the AutoCAD web and mobile folders.\\nPeople can then go in and edit that\\nand obviously, save a copy if they want to.\\nWhat you need to make sure of is that recipients have access\\nto AutoCAD on the web or AutoCAD on mobile.\\n\\nThat's the important bit.\\nIf they haven't got either of those,\\nthey cannot use that link.\\nSo make sure that they've got access\\nto AutoCAD on the web or AutoCAD on mobile.\\nIt's that quick and easy, honestly.\\nYou just share a link to the drawing,\\ncopy the link, there we go, copy the link,\\nput that into an email,\\nor perhaps even a text message and send that to them\\nand they can access the drawing.\\nIt's that quick and it's that easy.\\nNow the other tool is shared views,\\nwhich is slightly more in depth.\\nSo let's click on the shared views icon.\\n\\nThat'll bring up the shared views palette like so.\\nNow we don't have any shared views available at the moment.\\nSo what I'm going to do,\\nI'm going to click on new shared view like so.\\nAnd as you can see, it puts the file name\\nin the box there like so.\\nI can share the current view only,\\nor I can share the model view and all layout views.\\nNow you've got some other little tick boxes here.\\nCreate 2D views only.\\nI'm going to do that anyway 'cause it's a flat 2D floor plan.\\n\\nBut if you are working with an AutoCAD 3D model,\\nyou might want to create 2D views only of the model.\\nWe can also share the object properties\\nif you want to as well.\\nI'm going to tick that box.\\nSo now I'm going to click on share.\\nBackground processing of that shared view is ready to start.\\nNow you can tick it\\nand say, don't show me that message again.\\nI'll just hit proceed and off it goes.\\nIf you look in the bottom right corner on the status bar,\\nyou can see there that it's processing the shared view.\\n\\nIt's publishing it.\\nSo give it a little while.\\nIt takes a few minutes to do this\\nbased on your internet speed.\\nShare view upload is complete.\\nDo I want to view that in my browser?\\nWell, let's go for it, why not?\\nLet's have a look.\\nSo this brings up a thing called the Autodesk Viewer.\\nNow, the Autodesk Viewer\\nis a phenomenal little cloud-based viewer\\nand it's browser-based as you can see.\\nLook how quick that was\\nto share that drawing to the cloud\\nin a browser-based tool like this.\\n\\nNow, what's lovely about this\\nis it doesn't just do AutoCAD DWGs.\\nIt does Revit files, it does Inventor files,\\nit does Fusion files.\\nAnything Autodesk can be viewed,\\nand some things not Autodesk can be viewed\\nin the Autodesk Viewer.\\nSo if I now sign in to my Autodesk account again,\\nlike we did previously with AutoCAD Web,\\nlet's sign in there real quick,\\nit'll give me access to more tools\\nto work with in the Autodesk Viewer.\\n\\nSo as you can see,\\nlooking at the URL name in the browser there,\\nit's just viewer.autodesk.com.\\nSo what I've got now is some tools where I can zoom and pan.\\nSo as you can see, I'm zooming and panning.\\nAnd again, it's a little bit weird with the viewer\\n'cause it works in a slightly different way.\\nYou roll back on the wheel of the mouse\\nto zoom in, for example.\\nBut I can get in nice and close,\\nhold down the wheel and pan,\\nand if I get in a bit closer still,\\nlook at the detail and that's browser-based,\\nbut I can now measure.\\n\\nSo if I go to measure a distance,\\nI can go to that object snap there\\nto that object snap there like so.\\nI need to click and hold actually, there we go.\\nSo I click, and I just need to click there.\\nAnd as you can see when I come out to there, there you go.\\nIt's roughly 940, and it'll always give you a roughly,\\nbecause obviously this is not an exact copy of your drawing.\\nIt's not a DWG, it's what they call a collaboration file.\\nSo I can just hit Escape there to lose that if I want to.\\n\\nNotice I can go to the sheets.\\nSo there's my plot.\\nYou can see everything that might plot in there.\\nSo what I could do now is do a markup.\\nLet's do a markup in there.\\nLet's do a cloud like so,\\nand I might pop a cloud\\naround the restrooms there, for example.\\nThere we go.\\nI might pop some text in there\\nand just say something like, restrooms, like that,\\nquestion mark as if to say restrooms, please check them.\\nSo if I click away now, that's in there like that,\\nhit Escape a couple of times, job done.\\n\\nNow if I save that to that collaboration file,\\nit comes up here in the comments\\nand I can view those comments in my AutoCAD desktop as well.\\nSo that's now saved in there.\\nI've got a link.\\nI can send a link to that comment.\\nI can copy the link.\\nThat will last for, I think if I remember rightly, 30 days\\nand then it expires.\\nSo you'll also notice though, I can resolve that,\\nand then it will show the resolved ones as well.\\nSo the resolved ones from the comment trail\\nwill disappear once they're resolved.\\n\\nBut if I now quickly just jump back into AutoCAD,\\nlike so and refresh this, there you go.\\nThere's my comment there, click there,\\nthere's my comment, there's my restrooms.\\nI can zoom in and look at that if I want to.\\nIf I click there like that,\\ntakes me back into the viewer again\\nand I can view that in the viewer\\nas if I was somebody else in the office elsewhere.\\nHow incredibly cool is that to collaborate so quickly\\nand easily in a browser using the Autodesk Viewer?\\nI can't stress how important\\nthis little piece of technology is.\\n\\nIt's a browser-based viewer\\nthat allows you to mark up, measure and check drawings.\\nSo somebody with no AutoCAD experience whatsoever\\ncan experience all of your design,\\ncollaborate with you on your design,\\nand all they've got to do is log\\ninto a browser-based viewer.\\nIt's very, very clever technology.\\nI suggest you check it out.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"20.
