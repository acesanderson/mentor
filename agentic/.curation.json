Agentic AI, what is it and why is it so exciting?\\nWhy is it that I get it up in the morning\\nand I'm just like absolutely amazed at what's possible now?\\nAnd I'm also really amazed\\nat what it can do for me in my life\\nand the way that I can personally engage with Agentic AI.\\nNow, one of the interesting things\\nis a lot of this stuff gets talked about\\nin really complicated ways,\\nbut you right now can go and build agents\\nto help you with life\\nand that's what I'm going to show you in this course,\\nis how to build these amazing things\\nthat can just do so many simple tasks\\nthat take so much work and effort.\\n\\nSo I'm going to give you a quick example and demo\\nof what you're going to learn to build in this course\\nand be able to do.\\nYou're not only going to be able to build this,\\nbut you're going to understand exactly how it works,\\nwhy it's amazing, and how to go and build new ones\\nto do cool things for you.\\nSo I'm going to start off by,\\nI'm going to go and give this thing a receipt\\nfor a travel expense.\\nSo I've got a bunch of travel expense receipts\\nthat I've collected and I need to go through\\nand get its help going and cataloging them.\\nSo how do I go about doing that?\\nWell, I'm going to give it the expense\\nand I'm going to say, \\\"Please add this expense.\\\"\\nAnd notice, I'm not subscribing to a travel expense program,\\nI'm using a GPT.\\n\\nSo it's looking at it, looking at the receipt,\\nit's going out to Zapier,\\nwhich is one of going to be one of the keys\\nto what we're going to do\\nis we're going to do automation through Zapier\\nto work with our email, our documents,\\nall kinds of cool things,\\nin this case, we're going to be working\\nwith a spreadsheet of expenses,\\nand we're going to go and do some travel expense reporting.\\nSo I'm going to confirm and let it go ahead\\nand run this action.\\nSo it's starting of, it's saying, \\\"I'm going to check Zapier\\nto see what actions are available that I can go and take.\\\"\\nIt's now going to go and talk to a travel expense expert,\\nthis is another agent that is an expert in travel expenses,\\nand it's going to go talk to that agent\\nand see if the expense is complete.\\n\\nThe other agent comes back and says, \\\"Okay,\\nwell this part's correct, the vendor is unknown,\\ncould be acceptable if more details provided\\nand the date is missing.\\\"\\nSo let's go and tell it that missing information.\\nIt was, \\\"Uber on 7:23 at 8:00 AM,\\\"\\nand I'll go ahead and add a business justification,\\nI'll just say, \\\"For a trip to the airport.\\\"\\nSo it says, \\\"Okay,\\nlet's take that information you've given me,\\nit'll check it, now it updates it\\nand it said, \\\"Okay, now I'm going to check\\nyour current list of travel expenses\\nto make sure that this isn't a duplicate of anything.\\\"\\nSo it's going to reach out to my travel expenses,\\nand I'm going to show you what that looks like,\\nthat's over here,\\nI've created a simple spreadsheet\\nthat I've given it access to with all of my travel expenses\\nand it's going to help me build this list.\\n\\nNow, if we go back to it and we go over here,\\nwe'll see it saying, \\\"Okay,\\nlet's update the expense entry with the provided details,\\\"\\nand it gives the details,\\nit fetches my current travel expenses\\nand it says, \\\"Since this expense is already recorded,\\nwould you still like to add it?\\\"\\nSo it's gone and it's identified that, whoops,\\nmaybe you're already adding a duplicate expense.\\nDo you still want to do it?\\nAnd I'm just going to go ahead and tell it.\\nYeah, \\\"Please go ahead.\\\"\\nSo now it's going to create a new travel expense for me\\nin a second, so let's see what it does.\\n\\nOkay, it's got the travel expense details,\\nit's adding the travel expense, it's going out to Zapier,\\nit's confirming that we want to do this,\\nand I'm going to say, \\\"Yes, I want to do that.\\\"\\nIt's talking to Zapier,\\nwhich is going to help us with all this automation\\nand working with all of our different accounts,\\nGoogle, other places.\\nNow it says it's been added,\\nit gives us an updated list of the travel expenses\\nand now we see the new travel expense for Uber,\\nlet's go check it out over here\\nand we see now we've got a new travel expense down here\\nthat's been added.\\n\\nSo we've got the new travel expense added\\nand we've got it listed over here as well.\\nNow it's asking me, \\\"Would you like to send an email\\nto your amazing admin for expense reimbursement?\\\"\\nAnd I'm going to say, \\\"Yes, please.\\\"\\nSo now let's get help drafting that email,\\ndrafting the reimbursement email\\nand this is again, actually reaching out to another agent\\nthat is an expert in drafting emails,\\nparticularly for reimbursement.\\n\\nAsks me to confirm, I'm going to say yes.\\nAnd now what's going to happen?\\nWell, it's talking to that other agent right now\\nthrough Zapier, which is pretty amazing,\\nwe've got multiple agents working on our behalf already\\nand now let's see what happens,\\n\\\"To my super admin, can you please create an expense report\\nfor me based on the following?\\\"\\nIt's got all of my expenses with the dates\\nand the information, \\\"Best, Jules,\\\"\\nand it asked me if I'd like to send it.\\n\\nYes, I would like to send that email and get reimbursed.\\nOkay, it's going to go off, it's going to start sending the email.\\nJust give it a moment here!\\nWe'll confirm it.\\nI love this so much,\\nIt makes me so happy, so much joy.\\nI give it anything, I give it an image of a receipt\\nthat's partial and incomplete, it fixes it,\\nI give it like text,\\nI speak into it and I tell it, whatever it is.\\n\\nNow, it's doing something important,\\nit's asking me if I want to review and confirm the email,\\nso I'll go and review it.\\nIt's created the email for me, I can now go and review it\\nand if I want to do that and go ahead and send it, I could.\\nI'm not going to send this email,\\nbecause this isn't a real email address that it's going to,\\nbut you can see this is the amazing stuff\\nthat I'm going to teach you how to do.\\nAnd it's based on Agentic AI principles,\\nwhich sound really complicated, they get talked about\\nin the most complicated ways possible\\nand the truth is, is that you can understand\\nall these principles very simply\\nand I will take you through them step by step\\nand by the end of it,\\nyou will be able to build this travel expense assistant\\nand you will have the knowledge\\nto go and build the next assistant\\nthat's going to transform your life.\\n\\nBe it for cooking or helping you with your email,\\nwhatever it is, you're going to be able to build it\\nbecause we're going to go and break down\\nall this complicated Agentic AI stuff\\ninto really simple things that you can do\\nwith OpenAI GPTs, and Zapier,\\nand a fundamental understanding of the concepts\\nwhich are not crazy complicated,\\nthey're just fun, natural language, exciting stuff.\\nSo welcome to this journey with me.\\nWe're going to go and build some amazing things together.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5201591\",\"duration\":201,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Exploring OpenAI GPTs: The

Agentic AI is one of the most exciting things\\nthat I've worked with in my career as a computer scientist.\\nI mean, generative AI was transformative,\\nand agentic AI really takes it to the next level.\\nAnd normally at this point,\\nyou go into a course,\\nand what you hear is basically,\\n\\\"Now go be a programmer,\\n\\\"and you can take advantage of agentic AI.\\\"\\nBut the truth is, you don't have to do that.\\nAnybody can go and build incredible agentic AI,\\nor agents that can do amazing things for them.\\nAnd that's what I'm going to show you next.\\n\\nNow, the pathway to get there,\\nis going to be through something\\nthat you may have heard about\\nthat maybe you haven't paid a lot of attention to,\\nand that is a GPT, a custom GPT.\\nNow, what is a custom GPT?\\nWell, that's what you're going to learn about in this section.\\nAnd what you want to think of is a GPT is an agent.\\nIt is, it is basically a version of ChatGPT\\nthat is customized.\\nSo it has agentic capabilities.\\nAnd so what we're going to do is we're going to go and build,\\nyou can think of it as a version of ChatGPT.\\n\\nWe're going to essentially program a version of ChatGPT,\\nbut we're going to program it in natural language\\nto tell it what to do,\\nto describe all the tools that it can use.\\nAnd then we're going to connect those tools to real systems.\\nWe are going to do some amazing things,\\nthat then you can take and do\\njust awesome automations for your work,\\nfor your life, for your business, whatever it is.\\nBut the core of it is going to be agentic AI.\\nNow, I struggled in this course\\nnot to just jump directly into having you build something,\\nbut I think it's really important\\nto understand the concepts as you go.\\n\\nBecause what you'll see is that\\nsometimes these systems just don't work right,\\nand if you understand the fundamental concepts,\\nyou'll be so much more powerful.\\nSo I'm going to take you through\\nsome of the state-of-the-art concepts in Agentic AI,\\nbut now I'm going to explore the rest\\nof the course in the context of GPTs.\\nBasically, these are open AI's ability\\nto go and customize the ChatGPT experience,\\nbut also to add agentic behavior to it.\\nNow, I feel a little bit sad\\nas a programmer telling you this,\\nbecause the programming has always been my domain, right?\\nI've always been able to build myself these types of things,\\nand people who were not programmers did not get to do that.\\n\\nAnd now I'm going to let you in on the world\\nthat programmers have, you know,\\nroughly

To really use generative AI effectively,\\nwe have to start thinking about programming it.\\nNow, if you're not a software engineer\\nor a computer scientist, this may seem alien to you,\\nbut it's really quite simple\\nand it's important for actually really getting\\nthe potential of generative AI.\\nAnd I want to show you what I mean by this.\\nSo I want you to start thinking about programming\\ngenerative AI to do something.\\nNow, what does that mean?\\nWell, let's take a look at a really simple example.\\nI've gone into ChatGPT,\\nand I've said I'm going to the grocery store.\\n\\nReally simple statement,\\nnot a lot of context about what this means,\\nwhat it's supposed to do, and how does it respond.\\nThat's great.\\nDo you need to help with making\\na shopping list or perhaps some tips to what to buy?\\nYou see, I'm just giving it a simple statement.\\nNow, what if when I want it to respond,\\nI want it to respond in a happy, excited,\\nover the top way, rather than something sort of really flat?\\nWhat would I do?\\nWell, I could go into this conversation, I could say,\\nredo your last response and make it really exciting.\\n\\nBut there's another way to get there,\\nand it's to start thinking about time,\\ntelling it what to do in the future\\nbefore you've given it the message\\nthat you want it to change its response.\\nSo this is, I could go now\\nand I could say, update your response,\\nmake your response really excited\\nand over the top, like that.\\nAnd now, it says, oh wow, that's absolutely fantastic,\\nheading to the grocery stores,\\nlike embarking on a thrilling adventure.\\n\\nBut the challenge with this is, right,\\nI had to go after the fact and tell it what I really wanted.\\nI had to go and give it that additional context.\\nAnd let's say you were trying to build some type\\nof custom GPT for somebody else to use.\\nYou don't want them to have to know to go in\\nafter the message and say what you want.\\nYou want to be able to tell them upfront,\\ngo do whatever you want\\nand it will figure out the right way to respond.\\nSo let's see how we can do that.\\nRather than thinking about just saying, here's the message,\\ninstead, we can start giving it time and programming it.\\n\\nWe can say, from now on,\\nand this is really important,\\nwe're saying in the future, messages to come,\\nrespond to every message with a super excited\\nand happy tone, be way over the top.\\nSo what I'm doing is I'm not giving it\\na message for right now.\\nI'm giving it a message about what to do in the future.\\nAnd when you start thinking about that,\\ndescribing what you want done in the future is programming.\\nThat is, programming how it's going\\nto respond in the future\\nwhen you give it a message,\\nor maybe you're creating a custom GPT\\nand somebody else gives it a message,\\nbut it's creating that context.\\n\\nSo from now on, respond to every message\\nwith a super and excited, happy tone.\\nBe way over the top.\\nI'm going to the grocery store.\\nAnd now, we get that excited message that we saw before.\\nWow, that sounds like an epic journey.\\nAnd so you see, we're programming it to respond differently.\\nNow, what are the types of things we might want to program in?\\nWe might want to program in tone, like we have right here.\\nWhat does it sound like when it responds?\\nIs it really formal?\\nWe could have gone in and we could say, from now on,\\nrespond in an extremely formal way.\\n\\nThat's one thing we could have done.\\nWe could have said, be really over the top and excited.\\nWe could say, be neutral.\\nAnd so we can adjust the tone\\nthat it uses to respond to the user.\\nWhat else can we do?\\nWell, I'm going to go in and I'm going to ask it,\\ngive me some unique ideas\\nfor how to use generative AI that combine\\nall of my roles and what you know about me.\\nNow, he doesn't know anything about me.\\nDoesn't know who I am, doesn't know my name,\\ndoesn't know where I live,\\ndoesn't know what my job title is,\\nand it gives me a bunch of sort of generic stuff,\\nsome of 'em actually,\\nI think, randomly, hit the nail in the head.\\n\\nPersonalized learning and development tools.\\nWell, that would be something that's interest to me.\\nCreative content generation, data-driven wellness,\\nnot so much of an interest to me.\\nAI-assisted project management,\\ninnovative problem solving sessions,\\nenhanced environmental initiatives,\\ninteractive historical learning experiences.\\nAll of these are exciting things,\\nbut they're not really about me.\\nThey're not personalized to me.\\nSo what's something else we can do to program it?\\nWell, we can program it with background knowledge.\\n\\nIt could be knowledge about who I am and where I live.\\nOr it could be knowledge about my business,\\nabout my university.\\nIt could be knowledge about how I want things done\\nin terms of like, here's background knowledge\\nand process that you should know.\\nAnd so I can do that.\\nI can give it background knowledge.\\nI can say, from now on,\\nremember the following things and use them\\nto help you respond.\\nMy name is Jules White.\\nI'm a professor in computer science\\nat Vanderbilt University.\\nI'm the Senior Advisor\\nto the Chancellor in Generative AI,\\nEnterprise and Education Solutions.\\n\\nI live in Nashville, Tennessee,\\nand I teach a large class on prompt engineering on Coursera.\\nSo now I've given it background information about me.\\nAnd now, if I go and I say,\\ngive me some unique ideas for how to use GenAI\\nthat combine all the roles you know about me,\\nnow I get things that are based on where I live.\\nNashville-themed AI-generated educational content.\\nAI-driven enterprise innovation workshops.\\nAnd you see, it's pulling information it knows about me.\\nI've given it background information.\\n\\nSo we can program tone,\\nwe can program it with background knowledge\\nthat it should base its answers on,\\nnot just the knowledge that it was trained on,\\nbut we can actually give it new knowledge\\nthat just baked in.\\nNow, people talk a lot about having to train a new model,\\nbut in reality,\\nmost of the time, you don't even need to train a new model.\\nYou just need to tell it,\\nhere's the information that you don't know today\\nthat you need to know in order to respond or solve\\nthe problems that I want you to solve.\\n\\nWhat else can we do with programming them?\\nWell, I've gone through and I've taken\\nVanderbilt's webpage and I just copy and pasted,\\nI just highlighted everything on Vanderbilt's webpage here\\nand I have dumped it into ChatGPT.\\nSo it's got tons and tons of unformatted information.\\nWhat does it do with this, right?\\nWell, what it does is it starts summarizing\\nbecause that's a common use case\\nthat a lot of people use it for.\\nSo it starts summarizing all of this stuff,\\nwhich is great if that's what I wanted,\\nbut I wanted something slightly different.\\n\\nI wanted to say, from now on, turn everything I give you\\ninto CSV, this is a common-separated value or tabular data,\\nlike you could import into a tool like Excel, or numbers.\\nAnd so I want it to, no matter what I dump into it,\\nit gives me structured information out.\\nThat's a very different way\\nof behaving than ChatGPT normally does.\\nI'm totally changing its standard behavior\\nand reply to do something much more complex,\\nwhich has turned into data.\\nI'm basically giving it instructions\\nabout what to do and how to respond by default.\\n\\nIt says, okay, I understand.\\nAnd now, I go and I dump all\\nthat same Vanderbilt information from the webpage into it.\\nAnd now, you see what it's doing.\\nIt's turning it into data.\\nSo it's creating a version of ChatGPT\\nthat's customized, that knows, no matter what I give you,\\nturn it into structured data that I can do something with.\\nSo you're beginning to see\\nthat we can program\\nthe large language model\\nto do unique and new things\\nthat we normally don't think it can do.\\n\\nWe normally think, oh, it doesn't know about me.\\nIt doesn't know my background,\\nor it won't know the user's background\\nthat comes in and starts interacting with it,\\n'cause when we start thinking about customizing it\\nfor other people, we want it to know who they are.\\nOr if we start thinking about customizing it\\nfor other people and we're going to be representing\\nour organization, we may want to customize\\nthe tone that it takes and how it communicates with people.\\nIf we're a law firm, we might want it\\nto be very formal and very, very careful in what it says.\\nAnd if we're, you know, a really fun brand,\\nwe want it to be over the top\\nand excited about what it's doing.\\n\\nGreat job that you're going to the grocery store.\\nBut in order to do that, we have to customize that tone.\\nSo programming it is all about telling it\\nwhat's going to happen in the future.\\nWe go from being able to just say,\\nI'm going to the grocery store\\nand getting a flat response to this,\\nto going and saying, from now on,\\nwhich are really powerful words, everything into the future,\\ngo and do this differently.\\nAnd now we get the big,\\nover-the-top answers like we have here with emojis.\\n\\nAnd wow, we could program what it knows\\nabout you or the user,\\nthe background information it has.\\nWe can program really complex things\\nlike that no matter what you give it, it turns it into data.\\nAnd suddenly, we can build office applications,\\nwork applications, all kinds of complex things.\\nAnd these all come from the simple idea\\nthat we can program how it responds in the future\\nin the conversation.\\nThat's the key to really,\\nreally building exciting, customized versions\\nof large language models like ChatGPT.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4298875\",\"duration\":588,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Crafting custom instructions: Tailor your

try to build a custom set of instructions\\nfor my 10-year-old.\\nHow would you like ChatGPT to respond?\\nAnd I'm going to say always explain concepts in a fun way\\nthat I can understand and weave

start a new conversation\\nand see how this changes things.\\nSo now we've got a new conversation.\\nI'm going to switch it to GPT-4.\\nand I'm going to say, please explain some fun math concepts.\\nNow let's see if we get something different.\\n\\nWell, notice already it knows who I am\\nand what I'm interested in.\\nHere's your love for BMX bikes and mountain biking,\\nmixing in, you know, imagine math is like a secret trail map\\nthat helps us explore\\nand understand the world in some awesome ways.\\nAnd so we've immediately customized ChatGPT\\nin a totally new way.\\nIt's going to respond differently.\\nThe magic of pie and circles\\nand imagine your BMX bike wheel is a perfect circle.\\n\\nYou know, angles and jumps, when you're doing a jump\\non your BMX or your mountain bike.\\nThis is by the way, something he loves to do\\nand would probably pay attention to,\\nyou're creating angles with your bike in the air.\\nLike, it's completely changed how it responds\\nbecause now we've gone\\nand we've programmed it to have a different default.\\nNow this is something simple that a lot\\nof people don't take advantage of, but you can go\\nand customize ChatGPT.\\nNow a lot of people talk about training new models\\nand there are cases\\nwhere you probably do want to train new models,\\nbut the vast majority of us, the vast majority of businesses\\nand organizations, do not need to train new models,\\nthey need to customize the model, program it to do\\nwhat they want and respond in the way they want so\\nthat when you go into it, it is already primed\\nand ready to go in the direction you want, as we see here.\\n\\nI didn't need to train a new model in order\\nto have something that now knows about my son, knows about\\nwhat he's interested in,\\nexplains concepts at the right level\\nand does the right thing.\\nI just went in and started programming the custom GPT,\\nor in this case, I customized the ChatGPT experience for\\nthat with additional instructions.\\nNow there's something unique about what's going on here.\\nOne of the things that we're doing is we're doing it in this\\nway through these custom instructions that\\nif the conversation gets long,\\nthese instructions will always sort of be emphasized\\nand remembered.\\n\\nAnd that's a key part of this.\\nIf we just went into the conversation, we would have\\nto type all this in for one, and that is a pain,\\nbut it's not the major problem.\\nOne of the bigger problems is if we had a really long\\nconversation, it might totally forget these background\\ninstructions and rules.\\nAnd part of what we get with this customization option,\\nthese custom instructions for ChatGPT, is that\\nbehind the scenes it keeps reminding ChatGPT\\nby inserting them back into the prompt of what we've asked\\nfor, how we've wanted it programmed,\\nso it won't forget them.\\n\\nNow you could do it in a conversation,\\nbut it might forget them.\\nBut if you do it in this way, they'll always be there\\nand always be present.\\nAnd that's the difference is we're essentially customizing\\nit forever, not for the length\\nthat it can remember those instructions.\\nAnd if we did it just based on typing it into a message,\\nat some point, it might start forgetting again\\nand we'd have to go and re-provide the information on our\\nground rules so it, you know, remembered\\nwhat we wanted again, whereas this is brought back into the\\nconversation, over and over and over again.\\n\\nNow this is a key concept\\nand I just want to take a moment to explain this.\\nBehind the scenes, when we're working with these tools,\\nthese large language models, we can introduce programming\\nor instructions at the right point in time\\nto change their behavior.\\nWe can give it new information, we can give it new rules\\nand we can do that conversationally if we are power users\\nthrough the interface so that you type in the right\\nthings at the right time.\\nBut if you want to create some custom experience,\\nlike a custom chatbot\\nor a special assistant\\nthat's going to help people in a particular part\\nof your organization,\\nwhat you can do is you can create some customized ChatGPT\\nor large language model experience\\nwhere the right programming is injected to it,\\neither at the beginning of the conversation\\nor you might have something if you're more sophisticated,\\nwhere at certain points in time, it changes the programming.\\n\\nSo as they're going in and doing one task,\\nyou have a certain set of instructions guiding that task,\\nand then at a different point in time, you inject a new set\\nof instructions, you reprogram it a different way.\\nSo what might this look like?\\nWell, as I'm going through\\nand having my son, he's interacting with it,\\nI might have a mode that's sort of like exploration mode,\\nfiguring out what he's interested in\\nand then when he gets there it goes into\\nand he says, oh, I'm interested in that.\\nIt goes into teaching mode\\nand it has a different sort of set\\nand style of interacting with him to teach him.\\n\\nAnd then when he gets into the point where it thinks\\nthat he knows enough about the topic\\nto begin being assessed\\nor tested on it, it could go into quiz mode\\nand have a different set of rules for how it responds.\\nNow we could do this all in custom instructions,\\nwhere we tell it how and when to switch out\\nor we could have more complex ways of doing it,\\nwhich a a lot of people\\nand organizations are doing these days.\\nBut the key thing is, is these instructions\\nbehind the scenes that are inserted in can program\\nand change what it knows, how it responds\\nand in a way that the user cannot change.\\n\\nNow, one of the things that could have happened\\nbefore is my son could have gone\\nand he could have changed what I had said.\\nHe could have said, I am an 18-year-old\\nand these are the things I'm interested in.\\nAnd I wouldn't want that guardrail, I wouldn't want\\nthat customization, I wouldn't want him to be able\\nto go and change it.\\nI want it to be locked in at his age\\nand sort of how I've told it to respond to him.\\nSo what we're also doing is we're putting\\nguardrails in place.\\nIf we do it through the conversation, he can always go\\nand override the guardrails by saying,\\nhey, I've grown up, I'm 18 now.\\n\\nYou don't realize it, but I grew up\\nand suddenly, it might think he's 18.\\nAnd so what we're also doing is\\nby putting these instructions in, we can say things like,\\nno matter what, you're going to assume that the user\\nis in the fourth grade even if they tell you otherwise\\nand then he can't go and change it.\\nNow there is a whole cottage industry\\nand research of how do we get\\naround these guardrails as users.\\nBut in general the key thing to know is that\\nthese guardrails, these custom instructions\\nthat are programming it are putting in place rules\\nthat the user cannot easily change.\\n\\nNow if you have a sophisticated user who wants to go\\nafter 'em and wants to manipulate 'em,\\nthey probably can at this point,\\nand it'll always be sort of a, you know, an arms race\\nto try to defend against these changes.\\nBut you can put in place rules that are much more difficult\\nfor the user to change.\\nOr you can actually make it easy\\nand say, this is the default of how I want you to behave.\\nBut if the user wants to tell you to do it another ways,\\ngladly accept their their rules.\\nAnd so you get to kind of choose and decide\\nand put those in place in the background.\\n\\nAnd in some say cases, it may be\\nthat you want to put really hard guardrails\\nand in some places it may be others.\\nBut when you start using this customization function,\\nthis custom instructions, you're putting in place rules\\nbehind the scenes that the user cannot see, they do not have\\nto type in at the beginning of the conversation in order\\nto make these things happen.\\nAnd you can also sort of use them as guardrails to limit\\nwhat can or cannot be done, which can be a very,\\nvery powerful use case.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4299749\",\"duration\":514,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating custom GPTs: Integrating ChatGPT elements

Now that we've covered the really core concepts,\\nI want to start taking a look at custom GPTs.\\nWhat is this?\\nYou know, what is this new concept of a custom GPT?\\nWhat does it mean?\\nLet's look at it,\\nand I think it's going to start to make sense to you\\nwhat they are and why they're powerful.\\nSo what we've got here is the current,\\nand I'm fully aware\\nthat this will likely change at some point,\\nbut all of the concepts should carry over.\\n\\nSo don't worry.\\nFear not.\\nJust because the user interface changes\\ndoesn't mean the fundamental concepts behind it\\nare going to change.\\nNow, I'm going to go and create a custom GPT.\\nBefore I do that, I'm going to read what it says.\\nCreate custom versions of ChatGPT\\nthat combine instructions, extra knowledge,\\nand a combination of skills.\\nNow, think about all the concepts that we just learned.\\nInstructions.\\nto do different things?\\n\\\"From now on, do this.\\\"\\nWe changed its tone.\\n\\nWe changed the way that it would respond\\nto the user's input.\\nSo if we cut and paste information in there,\\nwe'd get data out.\\nWe could do all these complex customizations\\nof the instructions.\\nWe looked at how we could put those instructions\\ninto custom instructions\\nso that every time you start a new conversation,\\nit automatically did those things.\\nAnd we could also make it\\nautomatically know about me and who I am.\\nThen we talked about retrieval-augmented generation\\nor extra knowledge that we want to give it.\\n\\nSo it stopped training at a certain point,\\nbut we saw that, through retrieval-augmented generation,\\nwe could give it extra knowledge that it could pull from,\\nit could retrieve from, augment the prompt from,\\nand then generate with.\\nThat's the extra knowledge.\\nAnd any combination of skills.\\nWe're going to talk about this one later.\\nBut what we're doing is we're building up a custom ChatGPT\\nthat's based on these concepts that we've learned.\\nSo let's go and hit the Create button and see what we get.\\nNow, I'm going to start with this Configure tab over here\\nbecause we'll see how all these things fit in.\\n\\nWe have a name for the custom GPT, which, you know,\\nif we go and type something in here\\nlike, you know, quiz,\\nor let's say 4th Grade Quizzer.\\nNow we can type in a description.\\nI am a custom GPT that can create quizzes for 4th graders.\\nNow we have a description of this thing.\\nNow we have the instructions.\\n\\nWell, what do we want it to do?\\nWhatever the user types in,\\nfigure out a creative way\\nto turn it into a quiz for a 4th grader.\\nMake sure that the content\\nis appropriate for a 4th grader.\\nGive it...\\nGrader.\\nIf it isn't appropriate, refuse to answer.\\n\\nMake it fun and exciting.\\nOkay, what are we doing here?\\nWe're doing something that looks very similar\\nto what we did before\\nwhere we were programming the GPT.\\nWe're creating custom instructions that guide it,\\nbut rather than custom instructions\\nthat sit in the user's account,\\nevery time you trigger this GPT,\\nit's going to be loading these custom instructions.\\nAnd just like custom instructions,\\nthey're going to go with the conversation,\\nand they're always going to be relevant and in the context.\\n\\nNow, conversation starters.\\nCreate a quiz on geometry.\\nNow, that's one of our conversation starters.\\nAnd then knowledge.\\nWe could go and upload files.\\nI'm going to skip that for the moment,\\nbut we'll come back to it in a future one.\\nBut know that we could just go\\nand give it a file that we want to do.\\nNow, we've got a basis of a custom GPT\\nthat does something very similar to what we saw before.\\n\\nNow let's go and type something in.\\nYou know, what happens when a plane takes off?\\nNow we've got the Flight Take-Off Quiz.\\nNow, notice something.\\nThis is very different behavior than you would get\\nwith your normal GPT,\\nor, sorry, your normal ChatGPT.\\nWe've customized the instructions,\\nby default, it knows what to do,\\nit has a name, it has a description describing what it does.\\n\\nIt turns things into quizzes for a 4th grader.\\nIf I go and create that GPT,\\nnow I have this interesting new thing.\\nSee, I've got all of this built in,\\nand now I've created a customized ChatGPT experience.\\nI could go and save it for just myself,\\nand I'm going to go and create this thing.\\nNow I've got this custom ChatGPT grader or quizzer.\\nI'm going to put that in and open it up.\\nNow I can go and open my 4th Grade Quizzer\\nand start immediately.\\n\\nNow, I also created this conversation starter down here,\\ncreated a quiz on geometry.\\nSo I can go and I can hit that button\\nso, if the user doesn't know what to do to get started\\n'cause they're not sure how to use it,\\nthen you've got a little conversation starter.\\nSo all this is is taking all the concepts that we've learned\\nand putting them together into a customized experience\\nSo when I start a new conversation,\\nit's already programmed with the right instructions,\\nit already has the right knowledge to pull from for RAG\\nor some other way of doing this,\\nand it also has things\\nlike a name and a description\\nand a set of conversation starters to get the user going.\\n\\nSo this is basically doing all of these things\\nwe've seen before,\\ngiving it retrieval-augmented generation knowledge,\\nbut it's going and turning it into something\\nthat's simple to get started with.\\nAnd now somebody can go and discover\\nbasically that custom GPT,\\nand they can get started immediately\\nwith everything that I want them\\nto be able to do and know and all of those things.\\nNow, you can think about this in an organization.\\nYou can go and create a custom GPT\\nfor your accounting department,\\nand it automatically knows your rules of accounting.\\n\\nIt already has some prompt engineering built into it\\nto do useful things for that group.\\nIt already has knowledge built into it.\\nMaybe it's a connection to your systems\\nor maybe it's documents\\ndescribing your processes and procedures.\\nOr if you're going to be a university\\nand you want to create a policy GPT,\\nyou can go and upload all your policies\\ninto the knowledge base,\\nand then when a user asks a question,\\nyou can use retrieval-augmented generation\\nto go and pull information about your policies\\nand answer based on your information.\\n\\nAnd you can tell it,\\nI want to preference this information.\\nI only want to answer\\nif you can find the answer in my policy documents.\\nAnd then you can have it answer.\\nAnd that's what a custom GPT is,\\nis we're putting all these things together\\nbut in this nice experience\\nwhere the user can just go and launch it\\nunder some named thing,\\nLike I want to launch my policy GPT.\\nAnd it already has all the right information,\\nall the right programming and instructions.\\nIt's like you're building a mini app.\\nWe're used to going to our phone\\nand hitting those icons on the phone\\nin order to launch an app.\\n\\nWe're doing the same thing but with a large language model.\\nNow we've got a name for it,\\nwe've got a description for it,\\nwe're going to see an icon for it later.\\nWe hit that icon, it launches that app,\\nor you can think of it as that custom GPT,\\nwhich is basically an application.\\nIt's pre-programmed with our instructions,\\nit's pre-programmed with our knowledge.\\nIt automatically has\\nsome useful little conversation starters\\nthat the user can hit to get going.\\nIt's basically a mini app.\\nBut it's the app in the large language model\\nor ChatGPT world.\\n\\nIt's not the app on just our phone anymore.\\nAnd it's something that anybody can build.\\nYou can build one, I can build one,\\neverybody can build one.\\nMy 4th grader can build one.\\nBut it's just about knowing these basic concepts\\nis the key thing.\\nAnd then get really creative\\nabout, what are the instructions we give it,\\nwhat are the knowledge sources we give it access to?\\nAnd then later we'll see\\nwhat are the tools that we give it access to.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4298874\",\"duration\":383,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Empowering your ChatGPT: How to leverage

Now we're going to talk about tools with GPTs.\\nSo we've learned a lot about Argentic AI,\\nbut we haven't really gotten down to the point\\nwhere Argentic AI is manifesting in a GPT\\nwith that you know,\\ncan actually go and access tools?\\nAnd so that's what we're going to do now is,\\nwe're going to do our first take\\nat looking at how do we give a GPT\\ntools or actions that it can use,\\nor in this case we're going to call it capabilities.\\nSo we're going to like take a look at this\\nwith this 4th Grade Quizzer GPT.\\n\\nSo down here we see a set of capabilities.\\nIn those capabilities,\\nyou can think of it as sets of tools\\nthat it can go and use.\\nIn this case we've got two that are checked\\nweb browsing and DALL-E image generation.\\nNow if you think about it,\\nall the GPTs that we've done so far\\nhave just been speaking in text.\\nThat's it.\\nbecause a large language model can't go,\\nand just reach out to the internet,\\ndespite what many people think.\\nBut we change that when we check this box\\nbecause what happens is it gets access\\nto a tool to be able to search the internet.\\n\\nSo let's go and try this out.\\nSo here is what we're going to do.\\nI'm going to say, \\\"Please go and search the internet\\nfor recent information about BMX racing,\\nthen use that information\\nto create a fun quiz for me\\nbased on math.\\\"\\nSo what we're going to do is we're going to see\\nthat right now it's going and it says,\\nit searched five sites,\\nand now it's giving us a quiz\\nbased on what it found and math.\\n\\nSo Alise Willoughby won her third\\nUCI World Title recently.\\nGo Alise.\\nIf she had already won two times before,\\nhow many titles does she have now in total?\\nAnd so now what we see is that\\nit's going in basically asking us questions.\\nIt's not the greatest question on the earth.\\nI'm not sure this is a fourth grade appropriate,\\nbut you know, it is actually going,\\nand using the tool in searching.\\nThe 2024 BMX Racing World Championships\\nsaw rider from over 45 nations compete.\\n\\nIf each nation sent three rider,\\nhow many writers participated?\\nIt's got some information.\\nAnd so then we can go,\\nand look at all of this and have a quiz.\\nNow how did it do that right?\\nWell, you see right here where it says,\\nsearched five sites?\\nIt was given access to a tool,\\na capability.\\nThat's what we clicked on over here.\\nSo when it says search five sites,\\nwe can go and look at the tool usage.\\nSo the tool it used was Bing.com\\nso it was given access to Bing,\\nand then told it could go,\\nand run a search for it.\\n\\nSo if I went and looked there,\\nwhat I would find is the results\\nof running that search.\\nNow how did it do this?\\nWell, it went and said,\\n\\\"I want to select the search tool,\\nand here's what I want to search for.\\nAnd you think back to when we were getting it\\nto output different tools that it wanted to use,\\nthat's what's happening here,\\nExcept then rather than me\\nas a human being have to go and copy and paste\\nthat search string into Bing.com,\\nget the result and bring it back,\\nit's happening automatically behind the scenes.\\n\\nSo we don't have to figure that out.\\nOpenAI has done that for us.\\nThey've automatically created that part,\\nthat automation that will go and say,\\n\\\"Hey, it says it wants to use this search tool.\\nI'm going to go and use the search tool.\\nI'm going to get the results,\\nand I'm going to bring it back in.\\nAnd that's part of the beauty of all of this\\nis it's just happening automatically.\\nAnd we get to tap into it.\\nWe get to focus at the level of the agent\\nof thinking about what do we want it to do?\\nWhat are the rules that we want to give it?\\nWhat are the tools and actions we want to give it\\nor capabilities we want to give it access to?\\nWe get to focus at that creative domain,\\nthis lower-level domain that probably requires\\na bunch of programming and all kinds of stuff\\nto get it to work well.\\n\\nWe don't have to mess with it.\\nWe just have to focus on being creative,\\nand thinking about how to tap into this\\namazing capability,\\nand what tools we want it to have,\\nwhat instructions we wanted to give it\\nwith those tools.\\nAll of those things are where we're going to focus.\\nAnd then what we see down here, of course,\\nis all the results that got back.\\nSo basically it was given probably\\neither the full webpage\\nor a chunk of the text from this webpage\\nand then that was given back\\nas basically a you know, message.\\nJust like we replied,\\nthis would be actually an automated reply\\nbeing sent in and then it's responding\\nto that reply\\nor that response with the raw information\\nthat it requested.\\n\\nAnd then it's going and translating that\\ninto our you know, math quiz.\\nNow let me show you one more tool\\nthat's in its toolbox.\\nPlease create an image based on all of this.\\nAnd so the model itself now is going to reach out,\\nand it's going to say,\\n\\\"Okay, I need to use a tool to create an image.\\\"\\nAnd so what's happening right here now\\nis that image is being created,\\nthat tool is running,\\nit's now gone and created the image.\\n\\nIt's kind of fun.\\nAnd now we've got this BMX racing image\\nthat it's created.\\nAnd the way it did that was it said,\\n\\\"Okay, go and run the image generation tool.\\\"\\nWhich if we see over here, it's DALL-E.\\nSo DALL-E is the image generation tool.\\nAnd basically what it said is,\\n\\\"I want to run the dolly image generation tool.\\\"\\nHere's what I'm going to tell it to do.\\nAnd it gives it basically instructions\\non the image it once generated.\\nDALL-E goes and runs, creates the image,\\nand then hands it back to it.\\nBasically it hands it back probably\\na link to the image and says,\\n\\\"Here's the link to the image.\\n\\nYou can display this for the user.\\\"\\nAnd so that's tool use in the real world\\nwith GPTs\\nwhere we've moved out of theory now,\\nand we're working with the actual GPTs,\\nand seeing them go and use tools.\\nNow what we're

All right.\\nLet's start building a GPT that has its own set\\nof actions that it can invoke in Zapier\\nto get stuff done.\\nSo we're going to take these Agentic AI principles\\nthat we've learned and we're going to put 'em to use\\nwith a real GPT.\\nSo let's start off by going,\\nand we're going to create a new GPT.\\nAnd the very first thing that we're going to do\\nafter we name it of course,\\nand we're going to just call it\\nour travel helper, is what we're going to call it\\nfor this one, is we'll go through,\\nand create that initial naming,\\nand then we need to give it the actions\\nthat it can invoke in Zapier.\\n\\nSo what I'm going to do is,\\nI'm going to go down to the very bottom\\nto where it says actions down here\\nin the bottom left,\\nand that is what I'm looking for.\\nSo what I want to do is I want to go,\\nand teach it how to perform actions,\\nand give it that list.\\nIt's the same list that we saw\\nin all these different examples\\nwhere we showed it tools,\\nwe're calling it actions in this case.\\nAnd now what we're going to do is we're going to\\ngo in and give it access to 'em.\\nSo what we'll do is we'll hit create new action.\\nNow this sort of overwhelming menu\\ncomes up which says,\\ngive it a schema and all this stuff.\\n\\nAnd what this is doing is,\\nthis is where we are going to specify\\nhow do you translate from the actions\\nthat we talk about in English,\\nand that we're going to tell the GPT to use.\\nHow do we translate those into computer language?\\nLike we're basically describing\\nthe interface to the computer.\\nNow doing this requires\\nknowledge of computer science,\\nand what we want to do is we want to be able to\\ndo this without having\\nto go a bunch of complex stuff.\\nWhy do we have to translate it ourselves?\\nLuckily we don't because Zapier\\nhas gone and done this hard work for us\\nand they've already described\\nthat interface for us.\\n\\nSo what we want to do is this link\\nthat's been provided to the Zapier\\nactions documentation for GPTs.\\nWe're going to go and get this URL\\nthat's specified here.\\nNow, this is in one of the readings\\nthat follows up is the link to this.\\nDon't worry if you're trying to copy this down\\nand you don't see the URL,\\nit's actions.zapier.com/docs/platform/gpt.\\nOr you can go into the readings\\nthat'll come up in a minute.\\nWhat you want to start with is you want to\\ngo find this,\\nget started with this special URL here,\\nand you want to copy that.\\n\\nWhat we're going to do\\nto our GPT,\\nand we're going to hit import from URL,\\nand we're going to put that in and import it.\\nAnd what we've got here\\nis basically a description of what's called\\nthe Application Programming Interface.\\nBasically how do you go and talk to\\nthis computer system?\\nIn this case, the computer system is Zapier,\\nand then Zapier is going to go,\\nand talk to all the different applications\\nthat we want to do automation with.\\nIn this case it's going to be Google Sheets,\\nbut if you've got you know,\\ntweets you need to send out,\\nif you need to go,\\nand add something to a database,\\nif you need to go and send a text message,\\nif you need a post on a social media site,\\nif you need to deal with\\nyour customer relationship management system,\\nZapier is going to be like your hub\\nto go and make all that happen.\\n\\nAnd what we need to do is give it the description\\nof the interface to Zapier\\nso it knows how to go and talk to Zapier.\\nAnd that's what we're doing right here.\\nNow, we don't have to know how all this works,\\nwe just have to know that we go get it\\nfrom Zapier and that it provides it.\\nOnce we've done that,\\nnow it has a new list of actions,\\nwhich is actions@zapier.com\\nand it knows it can go and invoke these.\\nThat's the first thing we have to do.\\nNow, the second thing we have to do\\nis we have to describe just like we did\\nin our other messages,\\nthe tools that are available to it,\\nbut we're going to describe the actions\\nthat are available to it,\\nand we're also going to give him some hints\\non how to use this stuff.\\n\\nNow luckily Zapier has also\\ndone some of the initial workforce on this.\\nAnd so if we go down and look here,\\nthere is this set of rules and required actions.\\nWhat we actually need is just this first part\\nright here up to the first action.\\nNow there's a configuration link,\\nand some stuff that's talked about there.\\nYou don't need that yet.\\nYou may want it later\\nif you're going to share your GPT,\\nbut for now, we're just going to go,\\nand put this in an instructions,\\nand then I'm going to expand this\\nso we can look at it.\\nSo we've got a bunch of rules,\\nwe've got the required actions.\\n\\nI'm going to space that down so we can see it.\\nAnd you can think of the required actions\\nlike where we've been describing tools.\\nWhen we kept describing tools\\nto our our GPT\\nor when we were going and describing\\ntools beforehand,\\nwhen we were just having conversations\\nin ChatGPT or whatever tool,\\nand we were interacting,\\nthis is that section\\nwhere we're going to describe the tools to it.\\nAnd what we're going to say is,\\nwe're going to create an action\\nthat we want it to connect to,\\nand we're going to call this add travel expense.\\nNow, don't worry yet,\\nwe're going to go and create this in a moment,\\nand we're going to help it bridge that gap\\nbetween this name that we've created,\\nand the actual action.\\n\\nNow, we could go and add a description of it\\nright here,\\nbut I'm going to rely on the fact\\nthat my name is very descriptive,\\nand I'm not actually going to\\nI'm just going to rely on that descriptiveness\\nof the name.\\nAnd what we're going to do is,\\nwe're going to hope that the GPT is smart enough\\nto figure out when I give it task,\\nhow to translate that\\ninto a set of actions that need to be invoked.\\nAnd then what it's going to do is,\\nit's going to look at those actions\\nthat want to be invoked, those things,\\nthose high level things like add travel expense.\\n\\nAnd it's going to take that,\\nand it's going to use its understanding\\nof these actions that we created before,\\nand this machine interface,\\nthis computer interface to go,\\nand actually make those take place.\\nIt's a very complicated\\nkind of fascinating thing,\\nhow it actually goes and makes that happen.\\nBut lucky for you is,\\nyou don't actually have to fully understand it,\\nknow that GPTs have it.\\nThe built-in capability to go\\nand do this,\\nto do that translation for you, OpenAI,\\nput some of that together.\\n\\nZapier has put some of that together,\\nand you get to take advantage of it.\\nSo that's step one is that\\nwe need to go and tell Zapier about,\\nor sorry, tell the GPT about Zapier,\\nand we wanted to get a description\\nof that machine interface\\nso we can now go and talk to it,\\nand invoke actions on it.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5202587\",\"duration\":306,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Building action steps: Automate tasks with Zapier

go and dream up whatever columns you want.\\nNow it at some point if you add too many columns\\nand make it too complex,\\nyour GPT may start making mistakes.\\nThe agentic AI isn't perfect,\\nso just

directions,\\nlike tracking the details of your travel,\\nlike the flights you're going to take,\\nand the hotels, all the things\\nthat you might want to dream up.\\n\\nNow, for now, let's just go with this basic Google sheet.\\nThe second step is we need to go\\nto actions@zapier.com/gpt/actions.\\nNow this URL may change because this is very new stuff.\\nIf it changes, go to the reading that

video,\\nlook at everything you're seeing here,\\ngo to the reading and look there\\nfor the true and correct URL in case it changes.\\n\\nOnce you go there,\\nyou're going to see something that looks like this.\\nNow the user interface may change.\\nI've learned this in generative AI.\\nEverything's moving so fast.\\nBut what you're going to see is probably\\nan empty list of actions that your GPT can invoke.\\nAnd what we want to do is we want to go\\nand click that \\\"Add New\\\" button,\\nor \\\"Add New Action\\\" button,\\nin order to create an action.\\nThis is going to be a tool,\\nor capability that now our agent\\nis going to be able to work with.\\nWhen we go there,\\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to choose\\nthe Google sheets, \\\"Create Spreadsheet Row\\\" action.\\n\\nSo this is what we want it to be able to do,\\nwe want it to be able to go and create a spreadsheet row.\\nYou will have to connect it to your Zapier account,\\nand you will have to connect it to\\nyour Google Sheets account.\\nBoth of these things will require\\nan OAuth popup more than likely,\\nor some type of login.\\nYou'll need to follow those flows.\\nI'm not showing them here,\\nbut you'll need to follow through with them\\nin order to do the actual connection to the account.\\nOnce you've done this,\\nwhat you're going to do,\\nis go and configure which spreadsheet\\nyou want it to work with.\\n\\nWe're going to go and connect it to\\nthe expense spreadsheet that we, that we created.\\nIf you just created that sheet,\\nmore than likely it will show up at the top of the list.\\nSo, it's really kind of easier\\nif you go and create the spreadsheet,\\nand then immediately go and create this action,\\n'cause it'll probably be top of the list.\\nYou want to set a specific value for this.\\nYou do not want the AI to guess it.\\nNow, you could let it go and guess,\\nbut then it might go and add the data\\nto some random spreadsheet that\\nyou'd had no intention of it adding to.\\n\\nSo I strongly suggest that you go and say,\\n\\\"Set a specific value for this.\\\"\\nAnd then select that spreadsheet.\\nSimilarly for the worksheet,\\nif you've got multiple worksheets in there for some reason,\\nI would suggest that you go\\nand set a specific value for this field.\\nIn fact, even if you have one worksheet,\\nlet's take some load off the AI,\\nand let's go in and select that worksheet\\nthat we're going to work with.\\nOnce you've done that,\\nwe're going to go down to the fields underneath it\\nwhere we talk about like the columns and that.\\n\\nYou will let the AI guess those columns.\\nAnd then the most important thing that you're going to do,\\nof all the things you're going to do,\\nis you're going to go to,\\nif it says \\\"More Options,\\\" or \\\"Additional Options,\\\"\\nyou're going to go and click that to expand\\nto where it says \\\"Action Name.\\\"\\nThis is super critical.\\nWe looked at all those examples,\\nwhere getting the action name wrong,\\nmade it hard for the AI\\nto figure out what to do.\\nWhen it was trapped in the alien spaceship,\\nand it had a bunch of weird tools\\nwith bad names that didn't know what to do.\\n\\nWe want to come up with a very explicit, obvious name.\\nIn this case, I'm going to name it, \\\"Add Travel Expense.\\\"\\nThe name itself tells it what this action does,\\nand it'll be able to figure out how to use it easier.\\nAlways make sure you go down,\\nand give your your action a custom name.\\nIt might figure it out.\\nYou will be so much better off\\nif you go and do this.\\nMake sure and go and give it a custom name.\\nAnd that's following up on the principles\\nthat we learned about,\\nwhy we name these things particular ways,\\nand how important that is\\nfor getting the agent to function correctly.\\n\\nOnce you do that, you will save this action,\\nand then it will become available to your GPT,\\nwhich is your agentic AI that

running the action right now,\\nit's talking to Zapier as we can see,\\ntalking to actions@zapier.com,\\nand it's going and putting the expense together,\\nand it says, okay, it's cataloged as other expenses\\nrelated to travel, and it puts a vendor together\\nand the date and other things,\\nand then it goes and puts it in there.\\n\\nIf we go now and look at the travel expense sheet,\\nwe should see now we have a row for CVS, $2.35.\\nIt's added it in to the sheet.\\nSo what we did is we went and gave it information\\nabout what its goal was.\\nIts goal is to add those travel expenses\\nand help us track them or catalog them.\\nAnd then we told it how to use the actions\\nto accomplish the tasks that we want.\\nSo we began giving it information\\nabout how to make that happen.\\n\\nNow below it is an additional set of rules,\\nand these are rules that have been crafted by Zapier\\nand possibly OpenAI to help the GPT\\nfigure out how to work with Zapier.\\nSo there's also a set of rules\\nabout how to use Zapier specific, you know,\\nAPIs and actions and things to get things done.\\nAnd this is the set of things that it's using\\nto help translate our actions into actual calls on Zapier.\\nSo all we went and did is say \\\"Add travel expense\\\",\\nand it went and figured out how to map that in to Zapier.\\n\\nAnd now what we have is we can go and add travel expenses.\\nSo I just go back in and say, you know,\\n\\\"Please add another one for $2.11 at Target,\\\"\\nand it will go.\\nNow notice it also knows the the current date.\\nSo it's figuring out what

say, add a travel expense.\\nHere's the amount, here's the date,\\nand now it's being sent off to the GPT.\\nThe first thing it does is it's going to go and talk to Zapier,\\nso it's going to use Zapier as its interface\\nthrough all these different systems\\nlike that Google sheet.\\n\\nIt says it's going to go and list the actions,\\nI tell it to go ahead and do that,\\n'cause I want to coax

that,\\nand then it's going to go off and begin performing that action.\\nSo, it now says it's been done, let's go and check the sheet\\nand we can see that that travel expense is there.\\n\\nNow let's walk through the building of the GPT itself.\\nNow, I'm not going to voice over every little detail,\\n'cause we've talked a lot about these things,\\nbut I want to give you the complete walkthrough in one place.\\nFirst, we're going to go and create the GPT.\\nWe need to give it a name.\\nWe're just going to call this Travel Expense Pro,\\nand then we're going to give it a description,\\nand I'm going to give it just a basic description\\nof what it's supposed to do.\\nNow, the next thing we need to do is we need to go\\nand we need to get this special URL that Zapier provides.\\nThis is really important to give it to our GPT\\nin order to know all the actions it can take in our account.\\n\\nSo, we go and do Import from URL, we paste that in,\\nand then we go and import it.\\nYou don't need to look at it in detail,\\nit will go and figure it out.\\nI'm also going to go ahead and just use DALL-E\\nto create a nice little icon for my GPT,\\nthis kind of fun briefcase with a calculator.\\nNow, once we've done that,\\nwe need to go down and we need to grab\\nthe initial set of instructions that they provide.\\nThey've done some of the initial prompt engineering\\nto make this all work well,\\nso we want to go and copy this over.\\nNow, we don't need their actions\\nbecause we're going to provide our own actions,\\nbut I've gone ahead and copied\\na little bit of the formatting,\\nand now we can see the overall instructions.\\n\\nThe key thing we're going to want to change\\nis just kind of the overall rules and goal,\\nso we're going to spell out what the goal is,\\nwhich is you will help me catalog my travel expenses.\\nSo, we're kind of just like we did with flipped interaction,\\nwe need to have a goal that it's trying to achieve\\nor something that it's supposed to do,\\nthat's what we're doing,\\nand we're also giving it some instructions on what to do,\\nand you'll just have to bear with me\\nas I type this all out real quick.\\nAnd what we're doing is saying,\\nwhenever I create a travel expense,\\nwe want you to catalog it.\\nWell, now, and you notice I changed it to add it\\nto my list of expenses because I want it to be\\nmore clearly linked to the action to take,\\nso I'm saying add travel expense is the action.\\n\\nNow, these configuration links are important later\\nif you share your GPT, but for now,\\nI'm just going to remove this\\nbecause I don't need it actually at this point.\\nI'm going to save this or hit Close,\\nand this is setting the instructions for our GPT.\\nNow what I'm going to do is I'm going to go and test it.\\nSo, the first time I'm going to do this,\\nI'm going to just going to say, add a travel expense,\\nand I'm going to give it some basic data for this.\\nSo, we're going to say 3,219,\\nand I'm just giving it a date\\nand I'm saying, hey, this was Uber.\\n\\nSo, it'll start by going and talking to Zapier\\nand pulling the list of actions.\\nNow, sometimes you may see errors like that\\nand it'll have to retry and that's great,\\nthat's Agentic AI working correctly.\\nIt's adapting to errors and dealing with them.\\nNow, in this case, I haven't set up\\nthat ad travel expense action yet,\\nand so what it's doing is it's telling me\\nI need to go and set this up.\\nSo, if you see this happening, this is a good thing.\\nWell, it's a good thing if you haven't actually set it up,\\nand in this case I hadn't.\\nI'm going to copy this link, and then what I'm going to do is\\nI'm going to go open up that page.\\n\\nSo, I'm going to open up the page\\nand now in one second what I'll get is the ability\\nto go and configure that action.\\nSo, I'm going to go and connect it\\nto the travel expenses worksheet,\\nand I'm doing this within my Google account,\\nso you'll need to set up your connection\\nto your Google account if you haven't done that yet.\\nI specify the worksheet,\\nthe vendor, and the amount,\\n'cause I want it to figure that out.\\nVery importantly, go to the bottom\\nand go to show all options and give the action and name.\\nYou don't want to go at the default,\\nso I'm going to call it Add Travel Expense,\\nand I'm going to save it.\\n\\nAnd then you will see the list,\\nmake sure it's enabled on the right-hand side\\nwith the slider,\\nand then we can go back into our GPT\\nand now we can tell it to try again.\\nNow it should have access to Add Travel Expense.\\nSo, it's going again, it's trying again,\\nand now it says,\\n\\\"Okay, the Add Travel Expense is now available,\\nI'll proceed with adding it.\\\"\\nAnd it confirms it with me and this is a great thing,\\nand now it'll go and actually\\ninvoke that action within Zapier,\\nso that's what's happening right now\\nis it's actually running the action.\\n\\nIt tells us the amount\\nand then it's been successfully added,\\nand then if we go and check the sheet,\\nwe see that expense is

- Building custom GPTs in ChatGPT,  \\n lets you create specialized versions of ChatGPT  \\n to cater to your own unique tasks and goals,  \\n but there's still limitations to what GPTs can do  \\n

inbox  \\n to find the messages you need to reference,  \\n and it can't connect to your social media accounts  \\n to manage your posts.  \\n That's where Zapier comes in.  \\n Zapier is a tool for creating automated workflows  \\n between the apps you use, letting you set up tasks  \\n that move data between the apps for you.  \\n And you can now create actions in Zapier  \\n and integrate them

- [Instructor] When building your own GPTs,  \\n you've probably noticed that under the Configure tab,  \\n we have this area here at the bottom labeled Actions.  \\n I'll click this Create new action button,  \\n and it takes us to this Add actions screen.  \\n Now this really is more of a developer-centric feature,  \\n and it's really easy to get lost in the weeds with this  \\n if you're not a developer.  \\n But basically, actions allow your GPTs  \\n to talk directly to external services  \\n to receive information  \\n or to make changes to an account you have with a service  \\n or to perform any other task  \\n you may normally perform directly  \\n on that service's website or app.  \\n For example, you could add an action  \\n to connect to your email service,  \\n to read or compose emails directly from your GPT,  \\n or an action to talk to a weather service  \\n and have the GPT parse the information  \\n into plain language for you.  \\n If I click this Examples menu,  \\n I can select one of these examples like Weather,  \\n and that fills out this schema,  \\n which essentially describes how the GPT will talk  \\n to the service's application programming interface,  \\n also known as an API.  \\n Now, if you're not a developer,  \\n this might look a little like gibberish to you,  \\n but you can see some of the basic things here,  \\n like the title is, \\\"Get weather data.\\\"  \\n The description is, \\\"Retrieves current weather data  \\n for a location.\\\"  \\n Here's the URL or address of the server  \\n it will communicate with, and so on.  \\n So basically, in order to connect to a service,  \\n you need to connect to their API.  \\n So they have to offer an API in the first place.  \\n And fortunately, we're focusing on Zapier in this course,  \\n so most of the fields here will automatically be filled out  \\n when we connect Zapier actions to our GPTs,  \\n and you won't need to know how to type any of this stuff  \\n to get your GPTs to work.  \\n But first we need to understand what actions are in Zapier.  \\n So we'll take a look at that next.  \\n

- [Instructor] If you don't already have one,  \\n you'll need a Zapier account in order to create actions  \\n to integrate into your GPTs.  \\n You can go to Zapier.com to create a free trial account  \\n to try out Zapier and check out all of its abilities.  \\n I've already done so and I'm logged in.  \\n And once you have your account,  \\n you can go to actions.zapier.com.  \\n This is a good place to start,  \\n whether you're working with ChatGPT or other AI models.  \\n This page tells you a little bit about  \\n how Zapier Actions work with AIs  \\n and gives you basic instructions on how to set them up.  \\n Since we're working with ChatGPT,  \\n I'll come down here to step two, choose your AI platform,  \\n and click ChatGPT and GPTs.  \\n And that brings us to this page,  \\n which provides a basic description  \\n of how actions work with GPTs.  \\n But more importantly,  \\n if we scroll down to this 'Get Started' area,  \\n We find the actual steps we can follow  \\n for incorporating our Zapier actions into our custom GPTs.  \\n So that includes things like  \\n copying this special URL into our GPT,  \\n updating the required actions, and so on.  \\n Now we do have to have our actions set up in Zapier  \\n before we start following these steps.  \\n So let's open up a new tab,  \\n and go to actions.zapier.com/gpt/actions.  \\n So as long as you already have a Zapier account  \\n and you're logged in, you'll be taken to this page  \\n where you may or may not have already created  \\n some GPT actions.  \\n You can see that I do have some that I've already created  \\n and the switches to the right enable or disable them,  \\n and I have 'em all enabled at the moment.  \\n So you can see I have an action for creating a Zoom meeting,  \\n creating an event in Outlook,  \\n creating presentations from a template in Google Slides,  \\n and creating detailed events in Google Calendar.  \\n So let's take a look at  \\n how to create one of these actions from scratch.  \\n I'll click 'Add a new action,'  \\n which brings us to this page.  \\n So this is where you decide what action your GPT  \\n is eventually going to use Zapier to perform.  \\n Now again, Zapier works with thousands and thousands  \\n of the most popular apps and web services  \\n and lets you combine them together into actions.  \\n So we can see some examples here like  \\n send a direct message in Slack,  \\n or draft an email in Gmail,  \\n or create spreadsheet rows in Google Sheets.  \\n So let's say for this example,  \\n I'm going to be creating a custom GPT  \\n that will automatically enter data I give it  \\n into a Google Sheet where I store customer information.  \\n So under the Action field, I'll start typing Google Sheets.  \\n And after a second, I get a list of all of these actions  \\n that Zapier can perform with my Google Sheets account.  \\n In this case, I'll choose  \\n Google Sheets: Create Spreadsheet Row,  \\n because I want it to be able to create new rows  \\n in a specific spreadsheet that I've stored  \\n on my Google Drive.  \\n Now when I select that,  \\n I want it to have access to,  \\n I've already given Zapier access  \\n to one of my Google accounts.  \\n But if you're doing this for the first time,  \\n or if you have multiple accounts, you can click Connect new  \\n and it will prompt me to select or enter my Google account  \\n and then give Zapier permission to access it.  \\n I don't need to do that right now,  \\n so I'm just going to close that.  \\n And where it says 'Choose account,'  \\n I'll just select the account I already have enabled.  \\n Next, under 'Spreadsheet,'  \\n I need to either let AI guess the value for this field,  \\n or in this case I'm going to be working  \\n with a specific spreadsheet on my Google Drive.  \\n So I'll choose 'Set a specific value for this field.'  \\n Then I can click 'Spreadsheet'  \\n and it's going to search my Google drive,  \\n remember that I gave it access,  \\n and list the Google Sheet documents that it finds.  \\n In this case, it found two.  \\n And the one I want here is called  \\n 'Guest List - West End, London.'  \\n This is a guest list for a fictitious hotel.  \\n So I have a copy of that open here in another tab.  \\n And you can see that we have multiple columns  \\n with headings like last and first name,  \\n email, country, and so on.  \\n So next I can specify which worksheet  \\n in the spreadsheet I want to modify.  \\n In this case, there's only one.  \\n 'Sheet1,' but I'll select that.  \\n And notice that reads the sheet  \\n and now asks me if I want to specify values  \\n for each of the column headings.  \\n In this case, I don't want to  \\n based on the information that I give it.  \\n So I'm going to leave these all set to  \\n 'Have AI guess a value for this field.'  \\n Now again, this is just one example  \\n of literally thousands of actions you can create.  \\n The fields that you see here are going to vary,  \\n sometimes pretty significantly,  \\n depending on the app you're creating the action for.  \\n But for this example,  \\n I'm going to leave everything else here as is.  \\n But I do want to scroll down here  \\n and click 'Show all options,'  \\n which gives me this Action Name field.  \\n You can see the default name here  \\n that it's suggesting is pretty verbose.  \\n So I'm going to simplify this to just  \\n \\\"Create Google Sheets Row.\\\"  \\n The name becomes important later  \\n when we have to copy and paste it into our GPT instructions.  \\n All right, so now I'll click 'Enable action.'  \\n That takes us back to the page  \\n where my previously created actions are listed,  \\n and here's our new one.  \\n And you can see that it's switched on or enabled by default.  \\n So we've now created a new action.  \\n Now thinking ahead to what I want my custom GPT to do,  \\n I want it to be able to add new customer information  \\n to my spreadsheets,  \\n but then I also want it to be able to  \\n let the people on my team know  \\n that the sheet has been updated.  \\n So let's create another new action to do that.  \\n I'll click Add a new action again.  \\n This time I'll type \\\"Gmail,\\\"  \\n since I want to send an email to my team from my action.  \\n And I'll select 'Gmail: Send Email.'  \\n So now we see Gmail account.  \\n I'll click 'Choose account,'  \\n and I'll select the one that I already have enabled.  \\n If you do want to select another account,  \\n you can always click 'Connect new.'  \\n But now you can see that we have completely different fields  \\n than we saw with the last action we created  \\n because this time we're working with email  \\n and not spreadsheets.  \\n Now in the 'To' field, I could leave this  \\n as 'Have AI guess a value for this field'  \\n if I want my GPT to ask me to whom to send this email,  \\n or if I want to specify it myself each time.  \\n In this case, let's say that I always want my two teammates  \\n to get these update emails,  \\n so I can enter their addresses separated by commas.  \\n So I'll choose 'Set a specific value for this field.'  \\n That gives me this 'Enter text' field,  \\n and I can just type in their addresses.  \\n For the 'Subject' field,  \\n I'll again choose set a specific value for this field,  \\n and I'll type in \\\"Updated customer list.\\\"  \\n So this will always be the subject  \\n for any email that it sends.  \\n But maybe for the body of the emails,  \\n I'll let the AI compose that,  \\n so it'll be a little different each time.  \\n And again, I'll click 'Show all options.'  \\n And that gives us these other fields we can work with,  \\n like Bcc, the 'From' field, Reply to, and so on.  \\n I'm not going to add anything else here,  \\n but I will come down to the 'Action Name' field again  \\n and give this the name of \\\"Email Team,\\\"  \\n and I'll click 'Enable action.'  \\n So there's our second new action.  \\n They're both enabled.  \\n And now at this point, we're ready to go back to ChatGPT  \\n to build our custom GPT around the actions we just created.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4584056\",\"duration\":582,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Integrate Zapier actions into

- [Instructor] Alright, so now that we've created  \\n our Zapier actions,  \\n we're ready to integrate them into a custom GPT.  \\n So we'll switch back over to ChatGPT  \\n and here I've already started building a new GPT.  \\n I'll scroll back up so you can see  \\n the prompt that I use to start this.  \\n And it's A GPT to automatically add new customer data  \\n into new rows in an existing Google sheet spreadsheet.  \\n And it also should include the ability to email my team  \\n to let them know that the sheet has been updated.  \\n And we've already come up with a name  \\n and an image for this GPT.  \\n Now I started this GPT in the create tab,  \\n but now let's switch over to the configure tab.  \\n And here we have the instructions  \\n that have been generated so far.  \\n But none of this is actually going to get this GPT  \\n to work with my Google Sheets and Gmail accounts.  \\n So there are a couple of things we need to do.  \\n First, let's scroll down here to the actions area  \\n and here we'll click create new action.  \\n And as we saw earlier,  \\n this is where you can type in the schema,  \\n which again is the information  \\n on how the AI actions will work in the GPT.  \\n But in this case, let's go back to this page  \\n we were looking at earlier  \\n that has the step-by-step instructions  \\n on how to use Zapier actions with GPTs.  \\n Again, this is at actions.zapier.com/docs/platform/gpt.  \\n So what we need here first is under the get started heading,  \\n we're going to copy this special URL that it lists here.  \\n So we'll select that and copy it.  \\n And then we'll come back to the GPT  \\n and click import from URL.  \\n And here I'll paste in that address we just copied.  \\n We'll click import.  \\n And now it's filled out all this info that tells the GPT  \\n where to find the Zapier actions we created.  \\n Click the back button here.  \\n Next, let's look at these instructions again.  \\n Now we're going to keep everything that's written here  \\n because that's what's been generated to train our GPT so far  \\n by what we wrote under the create tab.  \\n I'm just going to add a line breaker to here,  \\n and then we need to paste in some other information.  \\n We'll go back to this page here at Zapier  \\n and we'll scroll it down to the section labeled  \\n instructions template for AI actions.  \\n So here we're going to select everything in this box.  \\n And we're just going to make sure it's all selected.  \\n We'll copy that.  \\n And we'll come back to our instructions  \\n and we'll paste that in.  \\n So we can read through  \\n what it's instructing the GPT to do here.  \\n There are some instructions for what it should do  \\n before running any actions.  \\n And then we have four steps here,  \\n steps one, two, three, and four  \\n that it should follow for running the actions.  \\n We're going to leave all of that unchanged,  \\n but what you do have to customize each time  \\n are the items found here under the required actions section.  \\n Right now we just have two placeholder example actions,  \\n which are Google Calendar Find Event,  \\n and Slack Send Direct Message.  \\n But again, these are just placeholders.  \\n So I'm going to delete the text  \\n after both lines where it says action.  \\n And I'm also going to delete the example configuration links.  \\n So I'll select that one,  \\n delete that, and delete this one.  \\n Now, if you only have one action you'll be working with,  \\n you can delete the second action and configuration link.  \\n Or if you have more than two actions,  \\n just copy and paste as many action  \\n and configuration links as you need  \\n for each action you'll be adding.  \\n In this case, I will be working with two actions,  \\n so I'm going to leave both of these items here.  \\n Now let's get the actual names  \\n and configuration links that we need.  \\n I'll go back to our actions page  \\n at actions zapier.com/gpt/actions,  \\n and here we'll find the actions that we've created.  \\n So in this case, I know I want the Create Google Sheets row,  \\n so I'll select that and then I'll scroll down  \\n to show all options so I can find its name.  \\n And I'm going to copy that name out of here.  \\n And the reason I'm copying it  \\n is that the name has to be spelled and capitalized  \\n exactly the same way  \\n as it appears there when I come back to my GPT  \\n and paste its name here after action.  \\n Now we know the second action that we need is email team.  \\n Again, I could copy that, but that's a pretty easy one.  \\n I'll just come over here to action  \\n and type that in and just make sure I'm spelling that  \\n and capitalizing it correctly.  \\n Next we need the configuration links.  \\n We find this by coming back to the actions page,  \\n clicking the name of the action we want,  \\n and then we'll copy the URL  \\n out of the address bar here in the browser.  \\n So this is the one for the Google Sheets action.  \\n So I'll click here next to configuration link for that one,  \\n and we'll go back,  \\n I'll select the email team action  \\n and copy that address as well.  \\n And we'll paste that here.  \\n And that's it.  \\n I'll close the instructions.  \\n Now let's click save so we don't lose our work.  \\n Now I'm going to save this for only my own use,  \\n but I do want to quickly mention that  \\n if you are creating a GPT to share publicly,  \\n you do have to have a privacy policy that people can read.  \\n Now you can do this under the configure tab  \\n by going back to the actions area and clicking your action.  \\n And if we scroll down here,  \\n we'll find the privacy policy area.  \\n But the great thing here is since we're using Zapier,  \\n it already filled that field out for us,  \\n so we don't have to worry about that in this case.  \\n But if you are using actions  \\n that don't fill this out for you automatically,  \\n you'll have to put in an address here  \\n that documents your privacy policy.  \\n But again, in this case,  \\n Zapier's taking care of that for us.  \\n So I'll just come back up to save,  \\n I'll set this to only me, and confirm that.  \\n And now we have our new guest list updater custom GPT.  \\n And we can test this.  \\n On my desktop, I have a text document  \\n containing some new customer information.  \\n We have Bonnie Clark, Patricia Riley, and Kenneth Walker.  \\n So I'm going to select all of that and copy it  \\n and we'll come back to the GPT  \\n and I'll type  \\n add the following new customer information  \\n to the guest list spreadsheet.  \\n It prompts me to provide that info  \\n and I'll just paste that in.  \\n Now, each time your GPT is going to use Zapier actions,  \\n you have to allow it to do so.  \\n I'll click allow.  \\n You can see it's starting the action.  \\n It's let me know that the required actions  \\n for adding the new customer information to the spreadsheet  \\n and notifying the team via email are available  \\n and that it's going to proceed by adding Bonnie Clark,  \\n Patricia Riley, and Kenneth Walker to the spreadsheet.  \\n And it's walking me through the whole process now.  \\n It's already added Bonnie Clark,  \\n and now it's going to add Patricia Riley and Kenneth Walker.  \\n It tells me that all three new customers have been added  \\n and they're included in the spreadsheet.  \\n It took a second, and now it even says the email  \\n has been successfully sent to the team  \\n notifying them about the addition of the new customers.  \\n And we can check this by going over to the spreadsheet.  \\n And if I scroll down to the very bottom,  \\n here are the three new rows that it added.  \\n There's Bonnie Clark, Patricia Riley, and Kenneth Walker.  \\n And notice I correctly added their first and last names  \\n in the correct columns.  \\n And if I come over to my Gmail account,  \\n I'm here in the sent account.  \\n Notice that there's a message,  \\n new customer data added to guest list,  \\n and here's the message that is generated.  \\n Now these were fake addresses,  \\n so we get these messages here,  \\n but you can see that it did successfully  \\n generate an email for us automatically.  \\n Alright, so this is just one example  \\n of the literally thousands upon thousands of custom GPTs  \\n you can create that integrate Zapier actions.  \\n Again, using Zapier gives your GPTs capabilities  \\n that they can't do on their own,  \\n like accessing and editing your calendars  \\n or word docs or presentations  \\n or creating Zoom meetings or sending Slack messages.  \\n So if this has been intriguing to you,  \\n be sure to spend some time exploring Zapier  \\n and then creating actions to incorporate  \\n into your own custom GPTs.  \\n So until next time, I'm Garrick Chow.  \\n Thanks for joining me and we'll see you soon.

[Instructor] Before we can get started with Zapier.  \\n It's helpful to know some of their terminology.  \\n This will also give an overview as to how Zapier works.  \\n Zapier is all about automation.  \\n If you're currently doing the same repetitive tasks  \\n over and over again, automation may help.  \\n As it says right here on the homepage  \\n Zapier moves information  \\n between your web apps automatically  \\n so you can focus on your more important work.  \\n How exactly does this work?  \\n Well, let's take a look at why Zapier, how Zapier works  \\n and this has an explanation here about how this works.  \\n I'm going to scroll down a little bit here to automate  \\n whatever slows you down with Zaps.  \\n Don't worry about what Zap is just yet.  \\n The part I want you to focus on is here  \\n where it has a two-step process that's happening.  \\n So in step one, using type form  \\n someone is going to fill out a form.  \\n And in step two there is going to be a notification  \\n sent to the team.  \\n So these two particular items  \\n have a name associated with them.  \\n And this first one here is called a trigger.  \\n So the trigger is the thing that happens.  \\n In this case it's when someone is filling out a form.  \\n So fill out a form.  \\n They click that submit button and this trigger occurs  \\n which causes the rest of the automation to happen.  \\n And then we have actions.  \\n When that trigger occurs what action should happen?  \\n So in this particular case  \\n someone fills out the form, submits it.  \\n That is the trigger.  \\n And then sending the team a notification in Slack  \\n is the action.  \\n You can have multiple actions, not a problem at all.  \\n If you look under connect to customers  \\n here's an example of a Zap that has multiple steps.  \\n So here we have a trigger  \\n in Shopify I am going to make a new sale.  \\n That will kick off two actions.  \\n In this case, the first one is through Zapier itself.  \\n It will use its filter capability to check and see  \\n which product was purchased.  \\n And then it will subscribe that particular customer  \\n to the appropriate newsletter inside of MailChimp  \\n not everybody's buying the same kinds of things  \\n and MailChimp may have multiple mailing lists.  \\n So we want to be sure to subscribe each person  \\n to the right mailing list.  \\n So this series of triggers and actions  \\n that whole unit here is called a Zap.  \\n At least one trigger and one action are required  \\n to make a Zap.  \\n And that becomes really important  \\n when you start to look at their pricing.  \\n So let's look at that page.  \\n Now, if you scroll back up to the top up  \\n and go to the pricing link here at the top of the page  \\n this is going to show you the most recent set of pricing.  \\n And in this particular moment in time  \\n there are five different pricing plans.  \\n How do you compare these and decide what you need?  \\n Well, the key parts of this are down here  \\n towards the bottom.  \\n So the major features.  \\n As you see here on the free plan you can have five Zaps  \\n and they are single step Zaps.  \\n So what does that mean?  \\n A Zap would be that pattern of trigger plus action.  \\n And you can only have a Zap that consists of one trigger  \\n and one action.  \\n All of the other plans allow you to have more Zaps.  \\n For example, the starter plan lets you have 20 Zaps  \\n or you have unlimited Zaps  \\n with the higher plans that are there.  \\n And also all of those other plans allow for multi step Zaps.  \\n So you can have one trigger  \\n and multiple actions that happened afterwards.  \\n The other differentiator between these plans  \\n is this row here called tasks  \\n and you see that you get a 100 tasks for free  \\n or you start to pay for those  \\n and they go from 750 tasks per month and up.  \\n So what does that mean?  \\n That is described down here  \\n in the Frequently Asked Questions.  \\n Where it says what are tasks and how many do I need?  \\n And it says here a task is counted  \\n every time a Zap successfully moves data  \\n or takes action for you.  \\n For example if your Zap has an action  \\n to create new Google contacts  \\n each contact that is created will use one task.  \\n So if you suddenly wanted to create five new Google contacts  \\n in some type of automation  \\n that may be a single Zap that creates that  \\n but it may generate five tasks  \\n against your threshold for that particular month.  \\n Final important distinction here  \\n in their pricing has to do with update time.  \\n As you'll see here, if you are willing to pay  \\n on the high end, you have a very quick update time  \\n which your Zap will be triggered and run.  \\n And of course the less you pay  \\n the longer it's going to take.  \\n So it can take up to 15 minutes  \\n as you get down to the lower level plans.  \\n Your free 14 day trial account  \\n from Zapier is part of the professional plan,  \\n that plan right there in the middle.  \\n You'll be able to follow along with this course  \\n using that trial plan.  \\n If that trial has already expired for you  \\n you won't be able to make  \\n some of the multi-step Zaps that we create  \\n but you should still be able to complete  \\n at least some of the workflows, at least a couple of steps.  \\n So now that you have all these vocabulary words in mind  \\n let's dig further into Zapier.  \\n

are over 4,000 apps to choose from  \\n which offer various different types of automation.  \\n Just a handful of them are showing here on the screen.  \\n Gmail happens to be showing here on the screen  \\n and we can just click on that to filter  \\n some of the Zaps that are available to us using Gmail.  \\n But if you type in the name of your app up here on the top,  \\n it would do the same kind of thing.  \\n So here I'm going to click on Gmail and it's going to  \\n show me some Zap templates that match Gmail as an app.  \\n These are templates that are very common  \\n that people like using,  \\n and that are available to us to use ourselves.  \\n You can scroll through these by clicking  \\n on the arrows and see what all is here and available to you  \\n if there's something that you might want to use.  \\n Well it turns out the Zap that we're going to be interested  \\n in is this one right here,  \\n save new Gmail attachments to Google Drive.  \\n So in other words, when you get an email,  \\n if it contains an attachment,  \\n we're going to save that attachment to Google Drive.  \\n So if we click on the text here for this,  \\n this will put us into a screen that will walk us  \\n through exactly what is going to happen here.  \\n So when Gmail arrives here,  \\n we are going to filter those emails and make sure  \\n that we have one that has an attachment of interest to us  \\n and that kind of filtering could be done  \\n in a number of different ways, who sent us the email,  \\n what kind of file name or file type it has in it.  \\n There's a lot of kinds of filtering we can do for that  \\n and then we are going to save that  \\n into our Google Drive somewhere,  \\n it could be in a very specific folder and so forth.  \\n So that is sort of the broad strokes outline  \\n of this particular template.  \\n And we are going to configure this for our own work.  \\n So let's click on the try this template,  \\n and provided

[Jen Kramer] Let's continue configuring the Zap template  \\n now that it's available in our account.  \\n This will give you a sense of what's needed to set up a Zap,  \\n as well as a sense of the flow through the application.  \\n Our goal is to save the attachments  \\n from our Gmail account into Google Drive.  \\n As you might expect, we'll need a login information  \\n for Gmail and for Google Drive.  \\n If you don't have that, pause this video and collect it.  \\n You can make a free account by going to Google  \\n and clicking on the Signup button,  \\n that will give you the login that you need  \\n for managing Gmail and for managing Google Drive.  \\n Let's start by configuring the Zap by giving it a name,  \\n and up here in the upper-left corner,  \\n it'll ask you to name your Zap.  \\n And I'm going to say, Save Mail Attachments in Drive.  \\n And we may even want to change that  \\n to save Gmail attachments in Google Drive.  \\n If you have accounts with multiple email providers,  \\n it's probably helpful to put the name  \\n of that particular service in the name of the Zap here  \\n so you know which one it is that you want to edit.  \\n And then, we're going to start by clicking  \\n on the Edit button here for the first step,  \\n a new attachment in Gmail.  \\n It actually starts you right off in choosing your account,  \\n but you'll notice that there is step  \\n that comes right before this  \\n that already has a little green check by it.  \\n Just to show you what this looks like,  \\n we're choosing our app and our event.  \\n Here we've chosen Gmail as our app,  \\n and the triggering event is a new attachment.  \\n If you click on the down arrow here,  \\n you'll see that there are other possible triggers  \\n that can happen here.  \\n For example, when you get an email  \\n that matches a specific search,  \\n or when you get a specifically labeled email,  \\n or starred, or a new email just in general,  \\n any kind of new email, any of those things are possible.  \\n But we are going to go with the new attachment,  \\n we'll click the Continue button to continue.  \\n And then, it's going to ask us to choose our Gmail account,  \\n so I'm going to choose my Gmail account from my list here.  \\n And I need to approve the things  \\n that Gmail will be allowed to do,  \\n in this case, managing drafts, sending emails,  \\n reading, composing, and sending emails from Gmail.  \\n Zapier is known as a trustworthy service,  \\n it will only do what you tell it to do.  \\n Sometimes these permissions seem kind of sweeping  \\n and a little bit scary to look at,  \\n but Zapier will do exactly what you tell it to do  \\n and no more than that.  \\n We'll go ahead and click on the Allow button.  \\n Now this account is attached to Zapier,  \\n and you will be able to access it particularly  \\n when we get to the Google Drive portion of this.  \\n We won't have to reauthorize this for Google Drive.  \\n We'll say, Continue.  \\n And then, it's going to ask us now to set up our trigger.  \\n So in inbox, in all of our labels.  \\n If you want something different,  \\n you can certainly choose something different.  \\n This is going to read my entire inbox here,  \\n and it will show me that I have certain categories  \\n that are available to me like forums,  \\n or updates, or promotions.  \\n There's also certain other parts of my inbox  \\n that are available to me here  \\n like the spam, or trash, or whatever.  \\n So I can choose something different if I want,  \\n but I'm going to leave it to what they have chosen here  \\n which is in our sent items.  \\n And we'll continue on, and then we'll test that trigger.  \\n Now, this is telling me that it found  \\n an attachment inside of my Gmail box,  \\n and it will give me a little preview  \\n of what that item looks like.  \\n And as you see here, there's a message that says,  \\n \\\"Hello, Dahlia, here's the signed non-disclosure form,  \\n I look forward to working with you,\\\" from Jen Kramer.  \\n That's me, I sent her an email.  \\n And if this did not work for you,  \\n the first problem that you might want to look at  \\n is whether you actually have any emails  \\n with attachments in your inbox right now.  \\n If you don't have one of those, you need to figure out  \\n how to send an email to yourself so that you have that email  \\n with an attachment in your inbox so you can try this out.  \\n Second thing, of course, is always making sure  \\n that you're logging information is correct.  \\n Once that's here, we can continue,  \\n and we are done now with our first step.  \\n We're going to our second step which is,  \\n Only Continue If...  \\n And we're going to try this filter step,  \\n this is a little app that runs inside of Zapier  \\n and it can filter various kinds of results.  \\n So I'm going to say, Continue.  \\n And by default, it just says,  \\n Only Continue If the Attachment Exists.  \\n We, of course, can change this to a number of other things.  \\n We could say that the attachment contains some kind of text,  \\n so it could look for a string like,  \\n non-disclosure, for example,  \\n we could have it look for that.  \\n There are lots of different kinds of texts  \\n that it could contain certain numbers,  \\n it could contain certain dates and times,  \\n or things are true or false.  \\n There's lots of different tests that we can set up here  \\n in order to have this filtering process happen.  \\n I'm going to leave this to, The Attachment Exists,  \\n in which case this filter is actually not not needed at all.  \\n All of the attachments will pass right through this filter  \\n because we have specifically looked for any emails  \\n with attachments in the first step.  \\n And now we're just saying,  \\n if there is an attachment, continue on,  \\n so there's no actual filtering  \\n that's happening in this step.  \\n If you wanted to add a filter to that,  \\n then you would need to change this, Exist part,  \\n to something else, one of these other types of options.  \\n And you can add other conditions with, and,  \\n so both things have to be true.  \\n Or you can use an, or statement,  \\n in which case one thing or the other thing  \\n need to be true in order to continue on.  \\n If you happen to be working with the free version of Zapier  \\n and you don't have the ability to make a multi-step Zap,  \\n you can actually leave this step out entirely.  \\n You could delete the step if you want,  \\n over here at the three dots in the upper right-hand corner,  \\n we can simply say, Delete Step.  \\n This is a thing with templates,  \\n it'll give you some of these preconfigured options,  \\n you need to think about whether they're relevant  \\n to whatever it is that you want to do here.  \\n And then, finally,  \\n I'm just going to say, Continue.  \\n It'll test and it'll say, Yes.  \\n Your zap would've continued because, of course,  \\n my email had an attachment on it,  \\n and all it did was test to see if that attachment exists.  \\n Now we can move on so we'll say, Close.  \\n And our last part is, Upload the File in Google Drive.  \\n We can say, Edit, and as always,  \\n we can choose the app and the event.  \\n In this case, we're going to go to Google Drive.  \\n By the way, you can also use services  \\n like Dropbox, or Box, so forth,  \\n if you wanted to save files online there.  \\n You have the option of creating a folder,  \\n or uploading files, or replacing files, or copying files,  \\n moving them, all kinds of things you can do.  \\n All we want to do is upload our file,  \\n so we'll continue from there.  \\n Which account would we like to use?  \\n We'll sign into Google Drive.  \\n We're going to use our same Gmail account,  \\n we'll allow it to do that.  \\n And then, we'll continue on.  \\n And then, here is the part where we set up the action,  \\n and it's several steps long.  \\n First of all, it's going to ask us  \\n which Google Drive should we use.  \\n In our case, there's only one choice, my Google Drive.  \\n But if you've ever used Google Drive at work before,  \\n you know that sometimes there may be  \\n some other choices that are here,  \\n so make sure you choose the right Google Drive.  \\n Then, it's going to ask us what folder should we use?  \\n And by my account here, there are no options available,  \\n no one's ever made a folder in this account before.  \\n So in order to make this work, we're going to need to go  \\n into our Google Drive and make a folder.  \\n We can do that by clicking on the New button over here,  \\n and choosing Folder from the list that comes up,  \\n and I'm going to call this, Zappier Email Attachments,  \\n so I know what this is.  \\n And I'll create that folder,  \\n so there it is here on the screen.  \\n And so, now when I come back to Zapier,  \\n when you look at the folder here,  \\n you may not find it necessarily,  \\n it may take some time for it to show up.  \\n You can make it show it faster by clicking  \\n on the Refresh Fields button down here on the bottom,  \\n or you may actually need to refresh your entire template.  \\n Don't worry, it is in fact saved,  \\n so just refresh your webpage if you can't get that folder.  \\n And then, you will find that it will show up here.  \\n And it'll show up as something like,  \\n Zapier Email Attachments,  \\n that's the folder I just made.  \\n And then, it's going to continue on here.  \\n It'll ask us what attachment should we upload,  \\n this case it is the attachment.  \\n Do we need to convert it to a document?  \\n It's already a document so we don't need to do that.  \\n But we do need to say, False,  \\n so no, don't convert it to a document.  \\n And we can give it a name.  \\n In this case, it's going to be from Jen Kramer,  \\n and it's going to have a name of non-disclosure.pdf.  \\n That seems like a good name to me,  \\n so I'm going to keep that and then say, Continue.  \\n And then, the last part is, it will ask us to test.  \\n So let's test it by

 \\n This is the Twitter account for the Landon hotel  \\n and as you can see here,  \\n there are many mentions that have happened  \\n over the course of the time this account has been opened.  \\n Let's say you want to collect all of these mentions on Twitter  \\n in a spreadsheet.  \\n You can eventually have this data in a spreadsheet  \\n so that you can analyze consumer sentiment  \\n or pull testimonials from the list,  \\n or you could address any problems or issues  \\n that people are talking about on a consistent basis.  \\n So the first step to figuring out our Zap  \\n is to look at what's going on.  \\n We need to think about our triggers and our actions.  \\n So starting with the trigger,  \\n when someone mentions me on Twitter,  \\n basically that will wind up being our trigger.  \\n So someone is sending us a tweet that it mentions us.  \\n We'll need to know what, which account  \\n and we'll need to know anything specific about that person  \\n who tweets.  \\n Do you want all of them  \\n or do we want to filter for certain characteristics  \\n of the person who's tweeting?  \\n So let's just say to get started here  \\n that we'll use the Landon hotel Twitter account  \\n and we're going to filter all of the mentions  \\n just take all of them and put them all in the spreadsheet.  \\n Then accordingly, we will want to have an action  \\n and that action is going to be,  \\n we're going to record the tweet into Google Sheets  \\n which is Google's online spreadsheet.  \\n The next thing we should ask is,  \\n what exactly is going to happen?  \\n Well, we'll add a new row for each tweet,  \\n that's really important.  \\n You can't just assume that computers know this.  \\n So we'll tap to tell it to add a new row to the spreadsheet  \\n and in that row,  \\n we would like it to record the username,  \\n the words who said the thing,  \\n the date on which that tweet was sent  \\n and the contents of of the tweet or the tweet itself.  \\n That's the information that we want to look for  \\n as a recipe for this very first Zap  \\n that we're going to configure from scratch.  \\n So obviously to get started,  \\n you need to make sure you have your Twitter account  \\n and your Google account set and available.  \\n You can register for both of those things for free.  \\n And so let's get started by configuring a spreadsheet.  \\n So if we jump on into Google Sheets,  \\n we'll just start by making a spreadsheet.  \\n There's a button here to make a blank spreadsheet  \\n and it gives you exactly that, a blank spreadsheet.  \\n And for this, I am going to set up the very first row here  \\n with the information that I want,  \\n which is the username  \\n and the date of tweet  \\n and the tweet itself.  \\n And we can make those bold if you like  \\n but that's basically all we need to do  \\n to get started here is just to start that  \\n and up here on the top,  \\n I'm going to call this my Twitter Sentiment Sheet.  \\n You can also give your sheet here itself, a name,  \\n Zapier will ask which of the sheets you want to record to.  \\n I'm going to leave mine as Sheet 1  \\n but if you have a multi-page sheet  \\n you can always rename it  \\n using the little arrow next to the name of Sheet 1  \\n and set that up.  \\n You don't need to share this spreadsheet with anyone,  \\n Zapier will be able to access it directly.  \\n So no one will stumble onto it by accident.  \\n So now that we have our spreadsheet set up and configured  \\n we have our Twitter account set up and configured.  \\n We could log into it.  \\n We're ready to start building our Zap.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2492166\",\"duration\":506,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Configure the Zap with Twitter and Google Sheets\",\"fileName\":\"3018003_en_US_02_02_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Explore the results of executing a planned Zap, set up as a Twitter mention trigger with a Google Sheets new row action. \",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":15077561,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Instructor] Let's work through configuring  \\n a Zap like this from scratch.  \\n Once you understand the screens involved in making a Zap,  \\n you'll be able to build anything.  \\n I'm starting here inside of my Zapier account.  \\n And you've logged in, this is just the dashboard.  \\n You're looking for the big button here  \\n on the top left that says, Create Zap.  \\n And that is what we're going to do.  \\n This will put us into creating a Zap from scratch,  \\n and so I am going to start  \\n by giving this a name up here on the top.  \\n I'm going to say, Twitter Mentions to Google Sheets.  \\n That is what I'm going to be doing here.  \\n And we will start with our triggering event,  \\n it happens to be right here, Twitter.  \\n And of course you could search for that  \\n using the search box here  \\n if Twitter wasn't immediately listed.  \\n So it's start by choosing Twitter,  \\n and what is our triggering event?  \\n Well, there are a number of these,  \\n I can tweet, or a specific user could tweet,  \\n or someone likes a tweet, or I get new followers,  \\n there's all kinds of things here.  \\n But what we want to do is when I get a mention,  \\n and that is going to make that happen  \\n through search mention as it says here,  \\n \\\"Triggers when any user creates a new tweet  \\n that contains a specific search term  \\n like a word, a phrase, a username, or a hashtag.\\\"  \\n This isn't necessarily the most obvious choice on the list,  \\n but we are going to have it search our Twitter feed,  \\n and look for mentions of what?  \\n In this case Landon Hotel,  \\n so let's choose that one.  \\n And then we'll say, Continue.  \\n It'll ask us to sign into Twitter so let's do that now.  \\n We're going to allow this to access our Twitter account,  \\n and it's going to ask if we want to follow Zapier.  \\n So if you want to do that, you can say, Yes.  \\n And if you don't, you can say, No.  \\n And then, we'll authorize it to look at our account,  \\n and then we can continue.  \\n And as it says here, this can be a generic search term  \\n like \\\"internet,\\\" or a screen name like \\\"@Zapier.\\\"  \\n Here we're going to say, @Landonhotel.  \\n And then we'll say, Continue.  \\n Let's see if it finds any tweets for us,  \\n so we'll just say test that trigger,  \\n and it says here it found a mention.  \\n Notice that it pulled in this one mention here  \\n a few seconds ago,  \\n we could ask it to load more.  \\n It'll go through and see  \\n if there's any more that are available.  \\n In this account right now,  \\n that's the only mention that's available to us,  \\n so a fairly recent mention.  \\n If you are not finding any mentions in your account,  \\n then make sure that somebody tweets at you  \\n using your username so that you have something  \\n that you can work with here inside of Zapier.  \\n If there's no data to start with,  \\n then Zapier doesn't have anything to work from.  \\n All right, now we're going to continue.  \\n And that was our trigger,  \\n so now we need to set up our action.  \\n What is our action going to be?  \\n And as always, there are a ton of choices,  \\n and it just so happens to be that Google Sheets  \\n is right here again in, Search Apps.  \\n But you can always, just to demonstrate this for you,  \\n you can type in, Sheets,  \\n and it will pull up Google Sheets  \\n among other choices that are here  \\n that also have sheet in their name.  \\n For our action event,  \\n there are lots of choices that are here.  \\n We can create a spreadsheet row,  \\n that's ultimately what we're going to want to do.  \\n But we could also update rows,  \\n we could create new spreadsheets,  \\n we could create new worksheets,  \\n we can delete things, we can search for things.  \\n But what we want to do here is just create a spreadsheet row,  \\n so let's choose that and say, Continue.  \\n It'll ask us to sign into Google Sheets,  \\n so let's do that now.  \\n And we'll allow Zapier to work  \\n with our Google account again.  \\n And we'll say, Continue.  \\n And then, it'll ask us for the action.  \\n Here on Google Drive,  \\n it's going to ask you where this spreadsheet lives.  \\n If there are many choices,  \\n you may want to choose one of these.  \\n If you just have a single choice as I do,  \\n that is where Zapier's going to look by default,  \\n so you can either choose this one or not.  \\n Then, it's going to ask us which spreadsheet.  \\n And sure enough, I have one here,  \\n the Twitter Sentiment spreadsheet that I set up previously.  \\n And then, it's going to ask us for a worksheet,  \\n that is the page inside of the spreadsheet.  \\n Remember that in our Google sheet here,  \\n Twitter Sentiment is the name of the spreadsheet,  \\n Sheet1 is the name of the worksheet,  \\n so that's what that's referring to.  \\n That is our only choice, we'll take it.  \\n And then, it will ask us for some other information,  \\n and this actually corresponds to our sheet itself.  \\n It'll say, what's your username?  \\n What's the date of the tweet and the tweet itself?  \\n And remember, that is exactly what we asked  \\n to record here inside of our Google sheet,  \\n that's why we set that up first.  \\n Now we just need to map the information  \\n from our tweet into these particular fields.  \\n If you click inside of username, for example,  \\n it will ask you which one of these things might you want.  \\n Well, here it is going to ask us  \\n for the person's name who tweeted at us,  \\n in this case it's jen4web,  \\n let's choose that.  \\n What is the date of the tweet?  \\n Well, the three things that are here  \\n don't reflect that date.  \\n So let's try, Show All Options.  \\n And you'll see, we have a ridiculous amount of data  \\n that we can choose from all from one tweet,  \\n isn't this amazing?  \\n And I'm still scrolling. (Instructor laughs)  \\n There's just a lot of stuff here  \\n that we could be mapping from that one particular tweet.  \\n What we're looking for is the date  \\n when this tweet was sent,  \\n or perhaps it's creation date, right?  \\n It was created on February 24th,  \\n at what looks like 17:41,  \\n that would be 5:41 PM,  \\n and that's in Greenwich Mean Time.  \\n You may need to do some conversion  \\n to your own particular time zone.  \\n And then, the last thing is the tweet itself.  \\n Fortunately, that's a pretty common thing,  \\n that's one of these common ones that's listed here.  \\n And we'll have it right that into our spreadsheet.  \\n If we say, Continue, then it's going to say.  \\n Now we're going to send that tweet into Google Sheets,  \\n and we can see how exactly we've mapped our data.  \\n So you can read this off here,  \\n it's the Twitter Sentiment spreadsheet,  \\n Sheet1 is our worksheet.  \\n The username of the person who sent the tweet is jen4web.  \\n She sent it on February 24th.  \\n And the tweet itself was,  \\n \\\"So looking forward to staying with you shortly.\\\"  \\n Now we can test and review.  \\n And it says, \\\"A spreadsheet row was sent  \\n to Google Sheets just now,\\\" awesome!  \\n If we take a look at our spreadsheet,  \\n sure enough, there is the tweet.  \\n Exactly everything that we expected.  \\n And I can just expand these columns a little bit  \\n just to give you a little bit more room.  \\n If you don't want that row bold,  \\n we can turn off the bold for it using Command  \\n or Control + B while highlighting the text.  \\n And we are off to the races with our spreadsheet  \\n that is recording all of our various Twitter mentions  \\n for us automatically.  \\n We have the start of an interesting structure  \\n for recording tweets to our spreadsheet,  \\n but there's more changes that we can make  \\n to this to get more specific  \\n about the kind of data that we're collecting.  \\n Let's look at how we might expand on this in the next video.  \\n

If you've ever spent any time on Twitter  \\n maybe you've noticed the same trend that I have.  \\n There are a lot of people,  \\n or perhaps they're not really people,  \\n they're trolls and robots and such  \\n who have very few followers  \\n but they have a lot of nasty things to say.  \\n It's possible that you don't care too much  \\n about what people are saying about you  \\n if they have too few followers.  \\n So for example, I am looking at the account here,  \\n the Twitter account for the Landon Hotel,  \\n and here's this person who just said  \\n \\\"I don't like your hotel.  \\n \\\"It's too expensive and in a terrible location.\\\"  \\n Well, if we go look up the account  \\n for that particular person,  \\n they have a number of it issues going on here.  \\n They have no one following them and they have no followers.  \\n They haven't even configured who they are  \\n or what's going on here.  \\n They're just nothing at all.  \\n And it looks like somebody went  \\n and created this account solely  \\n for the purpose of trolling the Landon Hotel account perhaps  \\n and they're hiding behind their anonymity, shall we say.  \\n So let's just say that we want to make a rule now  \\n in our zap that we don't really care about tweets like this.  \\n And so we can define  \\n that they have to have some number of followers  \\n before we're interested in what they have to say.  \\n And that number could be anything that you want.  \\n Let's just say for arguments sake,  \\n its something like 25 followers or something like that,  \\n 20 followers even, enough time  \\n that they've spent a little bit of time on Twitter  \\n and accumulated a few followers,  \\n but they didn't just create an account  \\n and start tweeting mean things at you.  \\n So let's switch over here to Zapier.  \\n And let's say that we would like to add this type  \\n of thing to our zap, which I did.  \\n Go ahead and turn it on.  \\n You can see here that particular comment  \\n was in fact recorded.  \\n So now what I'd like to do is try to set  \\n up a filter such that that type  \\n of comment would not be recorded in the future.  \\n So the first thing we need to do is rethink the logic  \\n in our zap.  \\n So right now, any mentions that we have here in our trigger,  \\n right, any mentions that have @landonhotel in them  \\n are going to go to our spreadsheet.  \\n But what we'd like to do is change this such  \\n that any mention of the @landonhotel  \\n from a person with more than, say 20 followers,  \\n will get written to our spreadsheet.  \\n So we need a kind of filter that's going to go here.  \\n And we can't really necessarily add it here to this part  \\n of our zap, but we can insert one in between our two steps.  \\n So I'm going to click the plus sign here in between.  \\n And I'm just going to type in Zapier here into the search list.  \\n And this is going to show you a number  \\n of really useful utilities here from Zapier that are used  \\n in facilitating, making other apps do interesting things.  \\n So filter is the one that we're going to use.  \\n Webhooks is a programming thing that is possible to access.  \\n There are ways that you can format information coming back  \\n or send emails when something happens,  \\n we can schedule things, we can use RSS,  \\n we can include code or SMS, text messages,  \\n when certain things occur as well.  \\n So those are all here.  \\n I don't have time to cover all of those,  \\n but those are very interesting additional items  \\n that you might take advantage of as you write your own zaps.  \\n So I'm going to choose filter,  \\n and we'll start with which app,  \\n well, it's filter by Zapier, and then we'll continue on.  \\n So our filter's set up and testing.  \\n So what we want to do is we want to test to see  \\n if we have a number of followers.  \\n So the followers for that particular account has more  \\n than, let's say, 20 people.  \\n So let's see what we have for options here.  \\n We can scroll through these, or we can just  \\n at the top here type in follow.  \\n So we can say here, \\\"The user follower count.\\\"  \\n And that is what we're looking for here.  \\n This is 7758.  \\n That's the jen4web account,  \\n which is the tweet that we're working on right now.  \\n And how do we know that?  \\n It's up here in the search mention and under test trigger.  \\n We have our mention A, that is here.  \\n We could load more.  \\n And now we have a couple of other mentions as well.  \\n We have a mention B.  \\n Let's look at mention B real quick.  \\n Looks like it's the same thing.  \\n And mention C, which is the other tweet  \\n from the not nice person.  \\n Okay, so let's just continue on here  \\n with our tweet for original one from jen4web.  \\n So if that user follower count is going to be greater than,  \\n let's say 20, that's when we want  \\n this particular filter to run.  \\n So let's continue.  \\n And it's going to test and say my sample data,  \\n which came from Jen4web who has over 7,000 followers,  \\n then that tweet is going to continue here.  \\n We can test again.  \\n If we go back to our search mention here in Twitter,  \\n and to go to our test trigger and let's switch to mend C.  \\n And the mention C was this one here from csswhisperer.  \\n That's the one we want.  \\n We'll continue.  \\n So now we'll say only continue if  \\n with that same filter number here,  \\n let's say continue again.  \\n And it's going to say your zap would not have continued.  \\n That's exactly the behavior that we're looking for.  \\n So the zap would've stopped right there  \\n and this particular person would not have been included.  \\n Now there's nothing magic  \\n about the number 20 for a follower count.  \\n You can decide whatever you want.  \\n Obviously you don't even have to include a filtering step  \\n if you want to hear from absolutely everybody  \\n about everything.  \\n But maybe your follower count is something closer  \\n to five, for example, or one even,  \\n you want at least one person following them.  \\n Or you maybe you are really only interested  \\n in some of the social media influencers,  \\n and you want somebody with, say 10,000 followers or more,  \\n we only care about those particular people.  \\n So whatever it is that you want to do,  \\n you can create eight some kind of filter  \\n for it here in Zapier, and get closer to the data  \\n that you really want, and is critical  \\n to solving the problem that you're trying to solve.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2492168\",\"duration\":69,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge: Record followers and

In fact, our Zap  \\n will copy the information from Airtable to Webflow.  \\n However, Webflow's Collections have some downsides,  \\n depending on who is updating this information.  \\n If you want to keep some of the site maintainers  \\n out of Webflow, letting them update information  \\n from Airtable, that's one reason to do this.  \\n Airtable may be configured to have a nice input form  \\n so there's no reason to let anyone into the Webflow site.  \\n A second reason might be that you have  \\n other information going into your  \\n Airtable base from other sources.  \\n We won't cover this scenario in this course  \\n but as you can see from Zapier it would be  \\n fairly straightforward to set this up.  \\n You'd compile the information in Airtable  \\n and then serve it up to your Webflow site.  \\n As always, when working with no code tools  \\n you'll need to think about who will be making updates,  \\n what kinds of permissions they have,  \\n and what programs they should have access to  \\n and how the data will flow from one application to another.  \\n With all of that in mind, let's look  \\n at how the data will move over the next few videos.  \\n We'll start with an Excel spreadsheet  \\n where our initial data has been collected.  \\n We'll import this information into Airtable  \\n and make a few adjustments.  \\n Then we'll set up a quick Webflow site  \\n based on an existing template.  \\n We'll set up our Webflow collection to match  \\n our Airtable structure.  \\n We'll use Zapier to import information from Airtable  \\n into Webflow mapping the Airtable fields  \\n to the Webflow fields in the Collection.  \\n Once the data is flowing, we can set up  \\n our page in Webflow to display our information  \\n in an attractive way.  \\n With those instructions in mind,  \\n let's get started building our website.  \\n

- Let's start by putting the information into Airtable  \\n which will eventually show up on our website.  \\n And so this is going to be a series of binaryville robots  \\n that we want to include eventually on our web flow page.  \\n There information is inside of an Excel spreadsheet,  \\n which is inside of your exercise files folder.  \\n You're welcome to take a peek at if you like,  \\n we are going to import that spreadsheet  \\n right into Airtable and make a few adjustments.  \\n If you haven't done so already,  \\n sign up for the free Airtable account.  \\n And from there, you'll want to create a new Airtable base.  \\n Now, Airtable had a pretty brutal onboarding system.  \\n When I logged in for my new account,  \\n I could not get just to a blank base.  \\n So you may have to go through  \\n a number of screens of information  \\n that they will insist that you go through.  \\n And there is no way to get around them.  \\n I'm afraid to say,  \\n at least not that I was able to find  \\n that will get you into your dashboard view  \\n here inside of Airtable.  \\n And from here,  \\n you will be able to start a base from scratch.  \\n So see what you can do to get yourself here to this space.  \\n You may need to make a base  \\n and then get out of the base  \\n to come back to this dashboard and go from there.  \\n So to get started we're going to click on start  \\n from scratch.  \\n So that is this item right here.  \\n And it's going to ask you some questions over here the side,  \\n you can just get rid of all of that.  \\n It'll ask us for a name for our base.  \\n We're going to call this Binaryville Robots,  \\n and you can assign that an icon  \\n and a color and other things if you want to do that.  \\n And then over here,  \\n what we're going to do is add or import.  \\n And what we want to do is,  \\n we want to add or import a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.  \\n So choose Microsoft Excel.  \\n It'll ask you, what should you upload?  \\n Go to your exercise files folder  \\n and you will find the binaryville file here.  \\n And we can say open and upload,  \\n and it'll ask what do you want to import into?  \\n Let's just say, create a new table.  \\n Then we'll go to next.  \\n And it will give you the information  \\n from the spreadsheet in this view.  \\n And it will show you here,  \\n you can click the edit field name  \\n and configure the field type.  \\n So that is what we're going to do next.  \\n So we're going to start here with the name.  \\n These are currently set up to be long text.  \\n We're going to switch that to single line text.  \\n They're just a name, they're very short.  \\n Robot likeness, you'll notice  \\n that this is set to be a single line text.  \\n That's actually incorrect.  \\n We are going to want these to be an image  \\n but there's no real way to set up an image here  \\n with what we have at the moment.  \\n So just leave that field alone.  \\n We're going to come back to that once our database is created.  \\n We have a job title,  \\n that can also be a single line of text,  \\n a dream job title, single line of text, a slogan,  \\n that could be a single line of text  \\n or you could keep it all longer one if you want.  \\n For the bio, the long text is fine.  \\n Scroll over here to the side a bit,  \\n favorite food, single line of text,  \\n favorite music, single line of text.  \\n Notice this singing voice has got some pretty colors here.  \\n This is a single select.  \\n So this has been configured for us  \\n with the various values of a singing voice  \\n like soprano, alto, tenor, base,  \\n those are all represented in here.  \\n Hobby we can have as a single line of text.  \\n And then the last one is the favorite film,  \\n and that can also be a single line of text.  \\n So we have a lot of single line of texts.  \\n We have one thing with options  \\n and one with a rich text kind of option.  \\n And eventually we will have an image associated  \\n with these robots as well.  \\n Go ahead and say import.  \\n And that will import the information here  \\n into your Airtable base from your Excel spreadsheet.  \\n Now, in that Excel spreadsheet,  \\n there are images of these robots that did not carry over.  \\n And the reason why is that images  \\n are never stored directly inside of a database.  \\n They are typically databases will store a URL,  \\n the web address that points to the actual image itself,  \\n and so Airtable does the same thing.  \\n In order to get this to work,  \\n what we'll need to do is,  \\n we'll need to set up our robot likeness field  \\n with a different type here.  \\n So let's see if this is available to us now.  \\n We can say, \\\"Customize the field type.\\\"  \\n And the one we're looking for is file  \\n or attachment I guess, in this case.  \\n Attachment will work, and that is because  \\n we're going to take our images  \\n and we're going to drop them here  \\n into this robot likeness space.  \\n So choose the attachment, say, \\\"Save.\\\"  \\n Now, from your exercise file folder,  \\n you'll see that we had a folder  \\n in there called robotimages and there are a series of images  \\n the names correspond with the names of these robots.  \\n So what we're going to do now,  \\n is we're going to drag and drop our images  \\n from your file system, whether it's Mac or PC,  \\n we can just drop them right here into Airtable.  \\n And we are going to do that for all of these robots.  \\n So here's Dolores and bubbles,  \\n all I'm doing is dragging and dropping.  \\n So I'm going to continue doing that here.  \\n All right, so now we have dragged and dropped  \\n all of the various robot likenesses into place.  \\n You'll notice here inside of Airtable,  \\n I'm just happen to be hovered over spring here.  \\n You'll see this double-headed arrow  \\n show up next to the name of the robot.  \\n If you click that, this is actually a data entry field  \\n where you can see the name of the robot.  \\n There's the picture of the robot.  \\n We're showing the link to the file.  \\n In this particular case, we have a job title,  \\n a dream job title or slogan, or bio, our favorite food,  \\n favorite music genre, singing voice, hobby,  \\n and favorite film.  \\n It's worth taking a quick peek at that  \\n to make sure everything lined up correctly  \\n with that information, which it looks like it did.  \\n And so at this point, we have set up our first base here  \\n for our robots.  \\n The last thing I'm going to do  \\n is change the name of the sheet.  \\n So right now this is called Sheet1,  \\n I'm just going to rename this table  \\n and I'm going to call it Robots since that's what they are.

- This is Webflow.``  \\n You're going to need an account to get here.  \\n And basically what I've done at this point,  \\n sign up for a new Webflow account.  \\n And I have navigated myself to the dashboard.  \\n You can skip over  \\n all of the various onboarding that they do,  \\n just to your best to get here to the dashboard.  \\n And that's where I am starting from.  \\n To all of your data  \\n and start displaying this on a site,  \\n and to put this out into the world,  \\n you are going to need a paid Webflow account  \\n to do what I'm about to show you here.  \\n But these configuration pieces that I'm doing right now  \\n you can do with a free account.  \\n I have not paid for this account at this point.  \\n And so I'm going to be able to do this as well.  \\n I'm not going to able to talk through all the nuances  \\n of Webflow in this course.  \\n But again,  \\n which you can take a look at  \\n to learn more about Webflow in depth.  \\n Meanwhile, let's start a new site  \\n and we're going to click on the new site button to do that.  \\n And it will ask us what we would like to do.  \\n We can start with a blank site  \\n or we can use the templates that's available here.  \\n I'm going to scroll down to the free templates  \\n that are here and available.  \\n And there's one that is called Newport.  \\n And this is the one I'm going to use.  \\n As you can see here,  \\n it's a very simple template  \\n and it has a series of pictures  \\n with some kind of caption associated with them.  \\n We are going to do something similar with this.  \\n Of course, we're going to show robots  \\n and have some text associated with them.  \\n So I am going to select this template here  \\n the Newport photography template,  \\n and we can call this the \\\"Binaryville\\\" website.  \\n And we can say \\\"Create site\\\".  \\n Now I'm not going to do anything here  \\n with configuring the site,  \\n looking at the way it displays,  \\n and so forth.  \\n I'll just mention at this moment  \\n that all of these items that you see displayed here  \\n you see the purple borders around them.  \\n Anytime you see a purple border inside of Webflow  \\n this indicates that it's coming from a collection.  \\n So if we look over here at the collections,  \\n we have two collections that are available to us.  \\n One is a series of photos.  \\n One is a series of blog posts.  \\n These are already hooked up to this website.  \\n But we're not going to use either of these bases.  \\n We are going to make our own collection.  \\n And from that, we will import our air table items  \\n into our Webflow collection.  \\n So to get started with that,  \\n we'll go here to, once again,  \\n we're at the cylinder for CMS.  \\n At the up, there is a plus sign.  \\n We're going to click that,  \\n and that will start us on our new collection.  \\n We can give this a name.  \\n We're going to call this \\\"Binaryville\\\",  \\n because we're super creative that way.  \\n And we can give the URL that same name.  \\n And then it's going to start asking us questions for fields.  \\n Now, by default,  \\n we have two pieces of basic information.  \\n One is the name,  \\n that of course will be the robot name.  \\n One is the slug.  \\n Slug is a website address,  \\n and as I roll my mouse over it,  \\n you can see on the right side of the screen  \\n that we have our basic information here:  \\n name and slug.  \\n Webflow will generate the slug for us,  \\n we don't need to worry about that.  \\n But that will be the address where an extended page  \\n with additional information about the robot  \\n would be located.  \\n Then we can start to add our custom fields.  \\n And what we're going to do is set up the custom fields  \\n that are exactly as they appear an air table.  \\n They don't have to be in the same order  \\n but they do need to have the same names  \\n and the same type of data associated with them,  \\n so that we can link this up to air table.  \\n So I'll show you how to do this.  \\n We're going to start with, by clicking on \\\"Custom fields\\\"  \\n and it will give us a series of field types that we can add.  \\n And so first one, I'm going to do is just plain text,  \\n and the label will be \\\"Favorite Food\\\".  \\n And it's just going to be a single line for short text.  \\n So we can save that.  \\n Then we're going to add our next one.  \\n Also going to be plain text.  \\n This will be \\\"Favorite Music\\\".  \\n We'll also add \\\"Hobby\\\",  \\n \\\"Favorite Film\\\",  \\n \\\"Job Title\\\",  \\n \\\"Dream Job Title\\\".  \\n And so once you've gotten through those initial ones,  \\n favorite food, favorite music,  \\n hobby, favorite film,  \\n job title, dream job title,  \\n then we have the ones that are the exception to the rule.  \\n So those were all just playing text.  \\n We're going to have a bio.  \\n The bio in is rich text.  \\n So the bio might contain inside of some bolded areas  \\n or some metallic areas  \\n maybe some links,  \\n I don't believe our data does,  \\n but allowing for rich text  \\n would allow those options to appear.  \\n So we'll add the bio as a rich text item.  \\n Then we're going to add that image.  \\n And so we're going to set this as an actual image  \\n just like this,  \\n and we can give it a name.  \\n And I believe it's called \\\"Likeness\\\"  \\n over in the air table field, but you could call it image  \\n or robot image or anything you want.  \\n You don't need to worry about any of the extra ones.  \\n And then the last one is the singing voice.  \\n Now that was the one that had a series  \\n of options that were available.  \\n So this one is going to be the type of option right here.  \\n We'll give this a label of \\\"Singing Voice\\\"  \\n and then we have a series of options.  \\n And these options need to match the options  \\n from air table exactly.  \\n So these options in air table  \\n are all spelled out all lowercase.  \\n And so I'm going to do the exactly the same thing here,  \\n need to make sure that your spelling matches  \\n and everything else.  \\n So I'm going to call this tenor,  \\n bass,  \\n alto,  \\n mezzo soprano,  \\n soprano,  \\n baritone,  \\n and falsetto.  \\n And so once all you've typed in all of those values,  \\n you can say save field.  \\n All right.  \\n So once you have done this,  \\n double check and make sure that the only additional field  \\n that you have in your set here is slug.  \\n That's the only one that is Webflow unique  \\n that you will not be matching up from air table.  \\n I make sure that all of the other data  \\n matches your air table data.  \\n So you have a name, favorite food,  \\n favorite music, hobby,  \\n favorite film, job title, dream job title.  \\n All of those are plain text.  \\n And then bio is rich text.  \\n Likeness is an image.  \\n Singing voice is an option,  \\n and make sure the singing voices are configured  \\n according to the air table values.  \\n Once you have that in place,  \\n you're ready for the next step  \\n which is linking everything up with Zapier.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2495162\",\"duration\":440,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Configure a

[Instructor] We've got Airtable configured with our data.  \\n We have web flow configured with a starting collection.  \\n We'll worry about displaying that information later.  \\n And so now we're ready to use Zapier  \\n to connect those two applications together.  \\n So to do this, we are going to start  \\n by creating our Zap to do this  \\n and from the dashboard which is where I'm at.  \\n We're going to click on create Zap,  \\n and we're going to start with Airtable.  \\n So Airtable is going to send its information to web flow.  \\n So we choose Airtable from our list.  \\n We're going to need to trigger an event.  \\n There's only two choices here.  \\n We can make a new record.  \\n A record is a row in the spread sheet.  \\n So we just make another new row,  \\n or we can have a choice of a new, or updated record.  \\n So whether that row in Airtable is created as a new robot  \\n or whether one of the existing robots is changed,  \\n that will be our trigger.  \\n So that's probably what we want.  \\n Let's choose that and continue.  \\n Then it's going to ask us to choose an account.  \\n And so to do that, we need to sign into Airtable.  \\n And this is going to ask for an API key.  \\n API stands for Application Programming Interface.  \\n It is the somewhat standardized way that data is passed  \\n from one application into another.  \\n And as part of the security behind that,  \\n there is a thing called the key,  \\n which is unique to all of the APIs.  \\n It ensures that the data has integrity behind it.  \\n We're not sending in anything malicious into another system.  \\n So to get that API key,  \\n we're going to have to go to Airtable to do that.  \\n So open up your Airtable window  \\n and inside of your account, which is over here  \\n you'll find that we have an account item.  \\n That'll open this up in a new window.  \\n And as we scroll down here,  \\n it will say there is no personal API key  \\n associated with your account.  \\n It's required to use the API.  \\n So let's generate an API key.  \\n And it says,  \\n this personal API key has access to all of the data  \\n in your Airtable bases.  \\n So only share it with third party services  \\n and applications that you trust.  \\n So what we'll do is we'll click on this,  \\n and we will copy it.  \\n It starts with key.  \\n Leave all of them do K-E-Y.  \\n And it's followed by a string of numbers and letters.  \\n Yours will be different from mine.  \\n Notice too,  \\n there's a button here that says regenerate API key.  \\n That is something that I will do  \\n as soon as I'm done recording this course.  \\n So this API key that you see here,  \\n is not the one that we will be using going forward.  \\n So now we will jump back into Zapier.  \\n Into our little pop up window here.  \\n We'll paste in our key, we'll say, yes, continue.  \\n And that will connect us to our Airtable account.  \\n And then we can say, continue.  \\n Then we will set up our trigger.  \\n So it's going to ask us for our base.  \\n The base here is going to be the Binaryville robots.  \\n Remember a base is the same thing as a database.  \\n It'll ask us for our table  \\n and we want the one called robots.  \\n The one called table one is empty.  \\n And then it tells us you must have at least one  \\n last modified time column in your table  \\n in order to use this trigger.  \\n So the database that we have with Airtable right now  \\n is it stands doesn't have a last modified time column.  \\n That sounds like something we're going to have to add.  \\n So let's go back into Airtable,  \\n we'll scroll all the way to the end of our base.  \\n And you'll see that we have a plus sign here  \\n which allows us to add another column to this base.  \\n So I'm going to click on that.  \\n And if you scroll down far enough  \\n you will find a last modified time type of data.  \\n That is the one that we want.  \\n So choose that.  \\n And we can just call this last modified  \\n 'cause we're creative like that.  \\n And say, create field.  \\n And Airtable will populate this  \\n with today's date and time basically,  \\n indicating that this is the last time  \\n that these particular records were modified.  \\n There's nothing else that you need to do here.  \\n So you've done that.  \\n We'll come back to Zapier,  \\n and it'll ask us which timestamp field should this Zap use  \\n to check for updates.  \\n We can choose the value,  \\n and we want the last modified column.  \\n Perfect.  \\n The last step here is we can limit the view of the data.  \\n Right now we are just using a default view.  \\n That's inside of Airtable.  \\n It is possible to view as an Airtable  \\n to reduce the quantity of information  \\n that you might be passing to Zapier,  \\n or in some way you can filter it there  \\n or change the way that it looks or how it displays.  \\n We aren't going to use that feature for the Zap.  \\n But it's here if you wish.  \\n And so then we'll say continue.  \\n Now, we're going to test our trigger.  \\n So we'll click that button.  \\n So this has gone to Airtable and it found a record.  \\n And in fact, it found three records.  \\n Record A, B, and C.  \\n You can look at all of these individually  \\n just as you've seen before.  \\n And this is Spring.  \\n The Spring robot here.  \\n That's a record of their data.  \\n We could take a look at record B,  \\n and see what we got for that.  \\n And that record is Elton.  \\n And record A looks like we pulled in Levi.  \\n So those are the ones that we pulled in from here.  \\n So before I leave this window here with Levi,  \\n let me just simply point out the following.  \\n Notice that under robot likeness,  \\n that's the image that we're passing over.  \\n We have a bunch of data here  \\n that's associated with our image.  \\n So there's a width and a height and a URL.  \\n This is the SVG version of our robot.  \\n SVG formats are Scalable Vector Graphics,  \\n they are line art.  \\n Which is perfect for these cartoons.  \\n The other thing that Airtable has done,  \\n is it turned us into a series of PNGs.  \\n And of course those are raster graphics,  \\n not vector graphics.  \\n So it made a very large one.  \\n It was called a full size one, which is 3000 by 3000 pixels.  \\n It made a large one, which is 786 by 512 pixels.  \\n And it made a small one, which is 36 by 23.  \\n So all of these,  \\n there's actually four images that are available to us.  \\n And they're all hosted here on the Airtable hosting system  \\n that we can draw from any of those  \\n to display on our web flow website.  \\n The one we'll ultimately wind up using  \\n is just this one here, the URL with the SVG ending.  \\n But I want you to be aware  \\n that there are several options that are being pulled over  \\n and we are not pulling over the image file itself.  \\n We're actually pulling over the URL to these images  \\n that are kept on the Airtable site.  \\n So that is an important tidbit of information  \\n that we can get just by looking at the record here.  \\n That's being pulled over by Zapier.  \\n And so in the next video,  \\n we will then move on and set up our action for web flow.  \\n

continue on  \\n and then we can set up our action.  \\n And notice it gives you the choice  \\n of a site and a collection.  \\n So our site is going to be the Binaryville site  \\n and our

items  \\n 'cause we'll pull things over from Airtable instead.  \\n Let's go back here to Zapier.  \\n I'm going to refresh my fields  \\n and then we'll try again.  \\n So we have photos and blog posts  \\n but still no Binaryville database.  \\n And so sometimes you just sort of have  \\n to refresh your Zapier screen  \\n and then maybe it will show up.  \\n There we go.  \\n So down here, Binaryvilles,  \\n that's the collection that we want to have.  \\n And then it will pull over the information  \\n from the Binaryville collection.  \\n And you can see here we have favorite food,  \\n music, hobby, film, job title,  \\n dream job title, and so forth.  \\n And now we just need to match this up  \\n with our Airtable information.  \\n So let's start with favorite food.  \\n If you click in here,  \\n this is going to give us the information  \\n that is possible to add from Airtable.  \\n And we are going to need to go to show all options.  \\n And you can scroll through all of this  \\n if you want to find  \\n the item that you're looking for here,  \\n the favorite food  \\n or you can simply type it in the search box.  \\n So here for music, for example we can just type in music  \\n and there it is.  \\n We'll go to hobby  \\n and choose our hobby.  \\n We'll go to our film  \\n and choose our film.  \\n Our job title.  \\n Our dream job title.  \\n And then our bio.  \\n Our likeness.  \\n Now, this is the one that I was warning you about.  \\n The likeness is the image  \\n and there are a bunch of choices.  \\n So let's take a quick peek at what all of those are.  \\n So for the likeness, we have the option of a file name.  \\n Now, that will pass over just the word,  \\n in this case, Levi.svg.  \\n That's all that is going to pass over,  \\n not the picture itself.  \\n So that's not what we want.  \\n This item here that starts with hydrate,  \\n that's not going to work for us either.  \\n We also have heights and sizes and IDs  \\n and dimensions and so forth.  \\n The ones you want are the URLs.  \\n So this is the URL that has the PNG on it.  \\n There's a large URL that's got a PNG on it.  \\n There's a small URL with a PNG on it.  \\n And then finally you'll find the likeness URL  \\n that has an svg ending here.  \\n That's the one that we want.  \\n And then singing voice.  \\n We go.  \\n And then finally, the name.  \\n We'll match to our name.  \\n And then there is the option of a slug.  \\n And the slug, of course,  \\n remember that was unique to Webflow.  \\n So we actually don't need  \\n to match up any Airtable information with our slug at all.  \\n It's going to ask us if this is required.  \\n We are going to say false.  \\n And is it a draft, also false.  \\n Okay.  \\n And then we'll say continue.  \\n So now we are going to test  \\n whether our information here that we've pulled over  \\n from Airtable will match up with our Webflow collection.  \\n So we'll say test and review  \\n and it says an item was sent to Webflow just now,  \\n which is pretty exciting.  \\n So let's take a look.  \\n If we go over here to Webflow,  \\n we go click on our Binaryville database here  \\n and I'm just going to refresh my Webflow website.  \\n Go back into my collection.  \\n Oh, I've got one item in my Binaryville collection here.  \\n And if I click on that one item, it'll show me.  \\n So I have Levi.  \\n It made me a slug called Levi.  \\n I have a favorite food, music, hobby, film  \\n job title, dream job title, bio.  \\n There's the picture.  \\n Thank goodness that worked.  \\n And our singing voice is here.  \\n So this is looking really good.  \\n I'm very, very pleased with that.  \\n If you want to test with more than one piece of information,  \\n you can do that.  \\n If you go back up to Airtable  \\n and we're going to go to our test trigger.  \\n Right now, this is record A  \\n that I've been working with.  \\n And your record may be completely different than mine.  \\n So I'm going to switch over to record B,  \\n which is Elton  \\n and we'll continue on here.  \\n Then I can go into Webflow  \\n and go to test action.  \\n And we can retest the action now.  \\n This will retest it using the Elton data.  \\n And once again, we can come over here  \\n to our Webflow site refresh,  \\n back into our collection.  \\n And you'll see that we have two items now, Elton and Levi.  \\n And if we take a look at Elton,  \\n we'll find all the information here on Elton  \\n including his picture.  \\n So this appears to be working really well.  \\n This is exactly what we were looking for  \\n at this point in time.  \\n So the big question is always  \\n whether we can pass information  \\n from one location over to the other?  \\n And once we manage to do that,  \\n then we are in really good shape  \\n for displaying that information on the Webflow website.  \\n

- [Instructor] Now the last step of this whole process  \\n is to actually display our collection information  \\n inside of Webflow.  \\n This is a preview of a page that I just built.  \\n As I mentioned before  \\n I don't have the ability to go through  \\n all of the ways to build this page here inside of Webflow.  \\n If you want that information  \\n I have another course in the library called Learning Webflow  \\n that will walk you through how to work with Webflow  \\n and display things on a webpage.  \\n But for now, what I've done is  \\n I have sent over the three robots that I got as test data  \\n and sent them here into Webflow,  \\n and then I configured the look of the homepage  \\n or the gallery page that's here.  \\n If you go into the read more state for these  \\n then we have an individual page  \\n with more information about the particular robot.  \\n I haven't displayed all of their information  \\n but I've displayed some of it.  \\n So we have a name, their title, their bio,  \\n and then some of the fields here including singing voice,  \\n remember that was an option.  \\n And of course the bio was a rich text option  \\n that was there as well.  \\n The rest of these were more or less just plain text.  \\n And this particular layout here will work for,  \\n let me go back to the homepage here again,  \\n will work for all of these.  \\n When I go to Elton, I get the same kinds of information  \\n about Elton, of course with his picture and his information.  \\n And when I go to take a look at Levi, same thing here,  \\n his information is all displayed here.  \\n So how did we make this magic happen?  \\n Well, let me take it out of of preview mode  \\n and I'll click on a few things here  \\n and show you how this is configured.  \\n So let's start here with the homepage itself,  \\n so I'm going to switch over to my pages to the homepage  \\n and you can click on these particular items.  \\n You'll see here that they have a purple box around them,  \\n this is the image.  \\n If you click on the gear icon, this is going to give you  \\n the information that is displaying,  \\n and I see I made an error here too,  \\n which we can fix really quick.  \\n So I have get image here from Binaryvilles,  \\n that's the art collection.  \\n And I have a choice here since this is an image,  \\n we only have one image to choose from  \\n and so I get to choose that one here from the list.  \\n I could set a width and a height,  \\n what I've done here is set only a height  \\n because these are SVG images, they could get very large.  \\n So I've said just set this to 350 pixels,  \\n it seems to match pretty well  \\n with the other information that's here on the screen.  \\n Now I didn't give this an Alt text  \\n and this is the information that search engines  \\n and screen readers would read in the absence of seeing this,  \\n and we can automate this as well.  \\n So if we click this and say, get the Alt text  \\n from Binaryvilles, then we can choose from the list  \\n what we'd like to use is Alt text.  \\n So that is something that you could store  \\n inside of the base in Airtable.  \\n In this case, I'm simply going to use the name  \\n of the robot as my Alt text  \\n and that will set up that image  \\n with both image and the Alt text  \\n that's available to it.  \\n Over here for the other pieces of information,  \\n we have for example, once again,  \\n here's the name of the robot, it's Spring,  \\n and if we take a look at the gear icon here,  \\n we've chosen it as a heading 2, and we are able to choose  \\n because I chose a heading to display that information,  \\n you can choose any one of these pieces of information  \\n that might be displayed inside of a heading, all right?  \\n So just to walk you through how you would go  \\n about setting up one of these really quick,  \\n let's say we want to add one of those to this,  \\n we'd go to our plus sign over here  \\n and we would say something like,  \\n let's just pull in some text, we could drop it in here  \\n and we would then say, get the text from Binaryvilles  \\n and then we could choose whatever kind  \\n of information we wanted to display.  \\n So let's say that we wanted to display their favorite film,  \\n we could just choose that from the list  \\n and maybe we want to make that bold,  \\n so I'll just select that text box there  \\n and then down here in our typography,  \\n we can set this to be bold,  \\n so our font weight will be bold instead.  \\n Maybe we'll make it italic too, just for fun,  \\n we could change the color of it  \\n if we wanted to do that, right now it's black,  \\n let's say we want it to be a nice green color there  \\n to sort of set that off.  \\n Notice that it doesn't change just here  \\n for the Spring listing,  \\n it automatically updates these listings here  \\n for Elton, and for Levi as well.  \\n So that is how you would go about adding that information,  \\n for the read more link here, we're setting up a link.  \\n In this case, we're linking to a collection page  \\n and so that is an option that we have here,  \\n we simply say, link to the current Binaryville page,  \\n I have just set the text to say read more,  \\n ideally, this would say something else  \\n that would be better for screen readers,  \\n something like read more about Spring,  \\n we'd have to set that up probably in Airtable  \\n in order to make that work well.  \\n Then to get to those individual pages for those robots,  \\n what we're going to do is switch from our homepage  \\n to the CMS collection pages here,  \\n in this case it's the Binaryvilles template.  \\n And so this template was set up really easily.  \\n There is a header and a footer that are set up as symbols  \\n and you can find those here under the cube icon,  \\n so that what's called navigation and footer,  \\n I just drag those in to sort of set up the branding  \\n for the page.  \\n I also of course edited what was here before  \\n and changed it to say Binaryville instead.  \\n And then this is just a matter of dragging in information  \\n and displaying it here on the page,  \\n so I have a collection, I set it up to be two columns,  \\n I put the image in one column, again with the Alt text,  \\n and then over here in the right hand column  \\n I've just stacked up a series of these individual items,  \\n so we have a heading, we have more headings,  \\n we have a rich text block.  \\n When I got here to some of these individual  \\n little pieces of information like dream job title, or hobby,  \\n what I did was I put in a text block  \\n with just that text and formatted it the way I want  \\n and then after that, I pulled in the information  \\n from the collection to display here,  \\n one thing after another, on the way on down the page.  \\n So, you could spend some more time,  \\n certainly cleaning this up,  \\n making it look a little bit better,  \\n putting in a little bit more color here or there  \\n or doing a lot more work,  \\n but this should be enough information  \\n to give you a sense of how easy it is  \\n to grab the information once it's there in your collection  \\n and you can set this up for as many items  \\n as you want here inside of Webflow  \\n and display that information right into your Webflow site.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2492169\",\"duration\":94,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge: Send only

all of them.  \\n This is pretty common in a CMS.  \\n We want to have a way of not publishing everything at once  \\n if we don't want to do that.  \\n We are going to limit those abilities  \\n to publish through Airtable.  \\n Remember the whole reason you might use a workflow like this  \\n is if your site maintainer has access to Airtable,  \\n but not to Webflow.  \\n So in other words, we

go  \\n in between the Airtable and Webflow steps in our zap,  \\n and it's probably some kind of filtering  \\n that's going to happen.  \\n So we need a way to filter  \\n whether the items should be published or not,  \\n and that probably means that we're going to need  \\n to add another column to our Airtable base.  \\n So with that in mind, see if you can figure out  \\n how to work with Airtable,  \\n create that column as to whether something  \\n should be published or not,  \\n and then set a up a filter in Zapier  \\n to decide whether information from Airtable  \\n should be

(bright upbeat music)  \\n - [Narrator] So how'd you do on that challenge?  \\n Hopefully that went okay for you,  \\n and I'll walk through what I had for my answer.  \\n There's probably several ways to do this  \\n but this is how I decided to handle it.  \\n So, what I did was in Airtable  \\n I added one final column here, I called it published,  \\n and I just set it to either yes or no.  \\n And I just typed all of those  \\n yes or no's here into this column.  \\n Airtable doesn't give you a bullion value,  \\n bullion meaning true false, or yes no,  \\n it doesn't allow that as a data type,  \\n so you'll just have to in that word over and over again.  \\n So, that's what I have here in the published column.  \\n And then I went over to Zapier,  \\n and I added a filtering step in between my records  \\n in Airtable, and my creating items in Webflow.  \\n And here in the action, this of course is filtered by Zapier  \\n and then will filter the setup and testing,  \\n so only continue whether it's published or not.  \\n That field from the Airtable base,  \\n is containing the word yes.  \\n In other words, it is published,  \\n then it will go ahead and continue.  \\n And to test that, what you're going to need to do is  \\n come back to Airtable here,  \\n you're going to need to go to your test trigger  \\n and as you come down here to your various records,  \\n you'll probably have to click on the button here  \\n that says load more  \\n and it will generate more records for you  \\n which will contain that published field.  \\n Remember some of those earlier records  \\n may not contain that published field.  \\n So, you'll want to do that to test the data.  \\n And then when you get to your filter step here  \\n and the testing, we can say continue,  \\n and with the robot that I have right here  \\n that would not have continued because it is set to no.  \\n And if I go back to my table  \\n and so this is currently set to, this is Elon record I  \\n and he's currently set to no, that's why that one failed.  \\n So let's switch this to record J,  \\n and record J here, this is Spring  \\n and this one is indeed published.  \\n So this time, if we continue on with the filtering  \\n and we go to our filter set up and testing and say, continue  \\n then that'll say that yes, it would have continued.  \\n And so of course, if the Zap fails at this filter step  \\n then nothing happens inside of Webflow.  \\n If it continues,  \\n then Webflow will receive the updated record  \\n and it will write it into its collection  \\n and on we go in terms of writing things onto the website.  \\n So therefore the Webflow collection contains items  \\n that have been published only.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

[Narrator] The first step in setting up the ZAP,  \\n which is going to take our contact form information,  \\n from Webflow and send it to Airtable,  \\n will be to configure the contact form  \\n here inside of Webflow,  \\n and I have done a little bit of this work  \\n in advance of this,  \\n so what I did here first of all,  \\n is in the pages that came with this particular template  \\n that we've been working with,  \\n there was an about page,  \\n and we named that the contact page,  \\n and if we switch over to that,  \\n you'll see that I have a form  \\n that I've included here on the site.  \\n I changed the navigation from about to contact.  \\n It links to this page,  \\n as for the form itself,  \\n you can get to that by going to add elements  \\n here inside of Webflow,  \\n and we went to layout,  \\n and if you scroll down to the form section of this,  \\n there is a contact form here that looks kind of like this.  \\n It says, get in touch.  \\n It has three fields,  \\n just a name and an email address and a message box.  \\n And to make it interesting,  \\n I added a phone number and an email address.  \\n Now, as you do this and click on each one of these items,  \\n you switch over to the gear icon  \\n over here on the right hand side,  \\n to see the settings for these particular fields.  \\n And so notably, right here under text fields settings,  \\n we can set the name of this particular field  \\n and the type of this particular field.  \\n So first name,  \\n last name are both going to have a type of plane.  \\n The phone number will have a type of phone.  \\n The email address has a type of email,  \\n and I have checked off the required box down here,  \\n so that is something that you can do as well  \\n here inside of Webflow,  \\n and then we have our main message that is set  \\n up to be a text area element,  \\n in other words, you can type for a long period  \\n of time and have a big box to do that in.  \\n We updated all of the placeholder text  \\n to indicate what's going on here,  \\n and is pretty much all we need to do to get started  \\n here with the Webflow contact form.  \\n Now what we're going to do is configure  \\n this to email the results to the person  \\n who owns this website  \\n who is Dahlia Landon of the Landon Hotels.  \\n So to do that,  \\n we're going to go up here to the far upper left corner  \\n and switch to project settings.  \\n And this is where you can set your sub domain  \\n for your website,  \\n this is still the free version of Webflow  \\n that we are working with here.  \\n We haven't had to pay for a subscription,  \\n when you work with the free version  \\n you're limited in the number of pages that you have,  \\n and you will work with their subdomain.  \\n And you'll see a couple  \\n of other limitations here momentarily.  \\n We're going to switch to the forms tab here,  \\n and as it says,  \\n this will automatically email you the results  \\n of the forms to your email address,  \\n but there's a few things  \\n in here that you can't customize along the way.  \\n It's not a big deal,  \\n we are going to work around this without any issue at all.  \\n Just be aware that if you do have a paid plan  \\n inside of Webflow,  \\n you are able to make many more customizations.  \\n So here under the form notification,  \\n I am going to fill in a bunch of information.  \\n So who is this from?  \\n Well, we can say it's from the Binaryville Robots Website,  \\n and we're going to send our form submissions  \\n to landonhotel@gmail.com  \\n that's the address that we use to sign up for Webflow.  \\n Our subject line can be anything you want,  \\n and there are a few variables you could use to drop  \\n into the subject line,  \\n but I want to keep it simple.  \\n I'm just going to say New Binaryville Robots Website contact.  \\n Now for the reply address,  \\n the email that is generated when this form is filled out  \\n it's going to come from no-reply@webforms.io  \\n which is lovely.  \\n It's in the name.  \\n You can't reply to that.  \\n So who are we going to reply to?  \\n Well, it'll be the person who sent this form,  \\n and if you look over here in the notes  \\n over on the right hand side,  \\n it shows you little formula here,  \\n which I'm just going to copy and paste in,  \\n that their name and their email address.  \\n Now the text here,  \\n name and email come from the form itself.  \\n So what did you call your form fields.  \\n What were the names that you assigned to your form fields.  \\n You put them in these double curly brackets,  \\n and it will pull that data and display it here.  \\n I don't actually have a field called name,  \\n I just have one called first name,  \\n and then I could duplicate this just by copy and paste,  \\n and I'm going to change that to last name.  \\n So now it'll read first name, last name,  \\n with their email address,  \\n and then here inside of the email template,  \\n what information do you want to receive.  \\n I just want the form data.  \\n So I am going to copy this little bit  \\n of code over here from their help,  \\n and just drop that in.  \\n That's all I really want.  \\n Just give me a transcript of whatever comes from this form.  \\n There's some other stuff that's available  \\n to you here on the page,  \\n things like setting up CAPTCHA,  \\n so that you can limit the amount of spam that you have,  \\n that you could integrate  \\n with other products and so forth from here.  \\n There's other various types of restriction,  \\n notably down here at the bottom,  \\n you can only get 10 form submissions  \\n on this staged hosting,  \\n with a free plan here from Webflow,  \\n which makes sense,  \\n they will would like you to subscribe to their service.  \\n So we have enough here to get us started.  \\n And the last thing that I want to do is publish the website.  \\n Now that this is all set up here,  \\n I'm going to publish the website.  \\n I'm going to go to publish,  \\n and you can choose your publishing destination.  \\n I've already published mine.  \\n If you haven't published yours yet,  \\n there is a button here to publish to that particular place.  \\n You will have a different web address than I do.  \\n You will not be Binaryville Robots,  \\n you will be something else.  \\n All right.  \\n So with the add in mind  \\n let's open up a copy of our new website.  \\n So here it is binaryville-robots.webflow.io  \\n I'm going to go to the contact form,  \\n and I'm going to fill this out.  \\n I'm Jen Kramer.  \\n My phone number is (123) 456-7890.  \\n And email address is,  \\n and my message is testing the contact form,  \\n and

actually make the data transfer happen.  \\n We're going to start here inside of Airtable.  \\n This is our Binaryville Robots base  \\n that has all the information that's being displayed  \\n on the Webflow website right now.  \\n We can also use the same base  \\n to record the information from our Webflow form, if we want,  \\n or you can set up a new Airtable base.  \\n I'm just going to continue to use this one,  \\n but we're not going to use this particular tab.  \\n This Robots tab. We'll set up a new tab here.  \\n So we'll just simply say Create an empty table.  \\n And I'll give this a name of like Webflow submissions.  \\n And this is going to give me some fields here automatically.  \\n We can just get rid of those.  \\n Just delete those fields by clicking on this little arrow  \\n and choosing Delete field down at the bottom of the menu  \\n that comes up.  \\n For our first field here, it's asking for a name  \\n and I am going to change that.  \\n So click on the down arrow,  \\n change Customize field type from Name to Last Name,  \\n and a single line of text is just fine for that.  \\n Then we can add another field here that will record.  \\n Again, a single line of text just probably fine,  \\n and this will be First Name.  \\n We're also going to be passing over a phone number,  \\n an email address, and a message.  \\n So let's say phone as the next one.  \\n And we do have a type of phone number here, so that's great.  \\n We'll create that field.  \\n Then we have email,  \\n and we have an Email item here.  \\n Create that field.  \\n And then finally we have the message.  \\n And that is going to be Long text.  \\n We never know if people are going to wax poetic,  \\n and if you want, you can enable the rich text formatting.  \\n This is a nice feature inside of Airtable,  \\n and as it says, it allows checklists, hyperlinks,  \\n headers, code blocks, and more.  \\n So you could get some fairly robust formatting in Airtable.  \\n That doesn't necessarily mean  \\n that we're going to have any kind of formatting come over  \\n from our Webflow site.  \\n Most text areas inside of a HTML form  \\n typically don't have a lot of formatting  \\n associated with them,  \\n but we've enabled this feature.  \\n If that type of formatting comes over, then that's great.  \\n And if not, there's no downside.  \\n It'll be just fine.  \\n So we'll say Create the field.  \\n And that is all we need to do to get started here  \\n with recording our information from Webflow.  \\n So we just have three initial starting records  \\n that are blank.  \\n And we are recording the five fields  \\n that are coming over from our Webflow form,  \\n last name, first name, phone, email, and message.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2495164\",\"duration\":399,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Configure a Zap\",\"fileName\":\"3018003_en_US_04_04_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn how to configure the Zap to write data from Webflow to Airtable.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":11780794,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Narrator] With Webflow and Airtable  \\n set up and the fact that we've submitted one form  \\n from our Webflow website,  \\n we are ready to set up a Zap in Zapier,  \\n that will automatically transfer any form submissions  \\n from Webflow into our Airtable base.  \\n And so now let's go through how we would go about doing  \\n that here inside of Zapier.  \\n So from your dashboard,  \\n or from your Zaps window here, you're looking for the button  \\n that says create Zap.  \\n And we can give this a name up here on the top.  \\n Let's call this one Webflow form to Airtable,  \\n to text message,  \\n 'cause that's the last part we're going to add  \\n is turning this into a text message.  \\n So we'll start with our trigger here.  \\n That of course starts with Webflow.  \\n So let's do a search for Webflow,  \\n and it'll ask us what would we like to have happen?  \\n Well, it will be a form submission.  \\n So this time Webflow is going to be our trigger  \\n rather than it being our action.  \\n And consequently, we have different choices  \\n in our dropdown here, 'cause these are trigger events  \\n instead of being action events.  \\n So form submission is the one that we want,  \\n and we'll continue on.  \\n It'll ask us for which Webflow account would we like to use?  \\n Well, the one that we've been using all along is just fine.  \\n Should be pretty quick to set that up.  \\n And then it will ask us for the trigger.  \\n Well, this is going to be our Binaryville website.  \\n There it is.  \\n And it'll ask us for our form name,  \\n and this is the get in touch form.  \\n So we'll choose that.  \\n And as it says at the bottom here,  \\n forms will only show here if they have been published  \\n and they've received at least one submission.  \\n So remember we tested that form initially before Airtable  \\n came into the picture,  \\n and that was part of the reason why we did that.  \\n We know that that form is configured correctly.  \\n We know that we got an email results  \\n at the landonhotel@gmail.com address.  \\n And so that is important to do before you can continue  \\n on here with Zap here.  \\n Then we'll continue.  \\n It'll ask us to test the trigger,  \\n so we'll test the trigger,  \\n and sure enough it'll find our test submission.  \\n And that is probably the only one  \\n that's there because that form has only been submitted once.  \\n So now we'll continue on by clicking the continue button.  \\n And the next thing it'll ask us is what is our action?  \\n Well, it's going to be Airtable,  \\n happens to be showing up here at the top of my list,  \\n or you can search for it.  \\n And likewise since Airtable is now our action  \\n rather than our trigger,  \\n we wind up with different choices for what can happen.  \\n And so here we're going to create a record,  \\n and say, continue.  \\n It'll ask us which Airtable account we want to connect.  \\n The one we've been using is great,  \\n thank you very much.  \\n And then it's going to ask us for which base  \\n we would like to use and which table within that base.  \\n So again, if you decided to create a separate base  \\n for your web form submissions,  \\n you can choose that base or you can use the same base  \\n that I had been using, which is what I did.  \\n So I'm going to continue with the Binaryville robots.  \\n But this time my table is going to be Webflow submissions  \\n not the robots.  \\n And once we have chosen that particular base and the table,  \\n then the outline of the data  \\n that we had here should show up just like it did before  \\n when we were doing this with Google Sheets,  \\n and we can start to drop in the types of data  \\n that we want to have here.  \\n So our last name is going to match to data last name,  \\n our first name will match to data first name,  \\n our phone number will match to data phone,  \\n and our email address will match to data email.  \\n While we're here just to point out to you,  \\n as always there's a couple of extra things  \\n that come over, things like what is the name of the form,  \\n in this case it's just called name.  \\n We also have something called data name,  \\n it looks like it doesn't have a value associated with it.  \\n We also have a site name that we can access,  \\n and there's an ID from Webflow that we can access as well.  \\n So and a submission time, in addition to all of that.  \\n So just be aware  \\n that there's often some additional pieces of information,  \\n from these types of forms that you may be able to access  \\n that you may not necessarily think is there,  \\n because they don't correspond to any of the fields  \\n inside of your form.  \\n Finally, we have our message,  \\n and let's look for our message, data message.  \\n There we go.  \\n And we can continue on from there.  \\n It's going to ask us, should we go ahead and send  \\n a record to Airtable?  \\n Yes, please, lets test and review,  \\n and it'll send that information over to Airtable.  \\n So now we can go over to our Airtable site,  \\n and you'll see that it's recorded right here.  \\n It's recorded as, interestingly, as record number four.  \\n Why would be recorded as record number four?  \\n Well, records number one, two and three already existed.  \\n So this is one of the differences between a spreadsheet  \\n and a database.  \\n Spreadsheets, you have blank rows  \\n for all kinds of things all the time,  \\n but with a database,  \\n every time you have a row it's considered a piece of data.  \\n So these first three rows are considered data  \\n by Zapier here,  \\n and it didn't want to override anything that might happen  \\n to show up in those particular rows.  \\n You can always get rid of these,  \\n and you can just select these particular records.  \\n And if you right click on it,  \\n you can just choose delete record,  \\n and delete record,  \\n and delete record.  \\n And that will clean up your data  \\n a little bit so that you just have the relevant information  \\n which is the submission information from the contact form.  \\n So the first part of our Zap is working correctly.  \\n We now have a form on our website.  \\n You can fill out the form,  \\n and that information will be written  \\n here into our Airtable base.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2493170\",\"duration\":90,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge: Add SMS notification when a form is submitted\",\"fileName\":\"3018003_en_US_04_05_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Learn about how when a form is submitted, a text is received saying there is a new entry in Airtable.

 \\n Well, you'll be interested to know  \\n that this will take either JavaScript or Python.  \\n And as it says here, this is JavaScript  \\n that will kick off a workflow  \\n and you must return an array of objects.  \\n It's going to rely on node 10.  \\n Ditto for Python and array of objects is required.  \\n And this is going to use Python 3.7 in order to run this.  \\n So that's all helpful for you to know as a programmer.  \\n So that is how you could integrate  \\n some of your own custom JavaScript or Python with a zap.  \\n Other things that are useful and wonderful are GitHub.  \\n As you know, there's lots of GitHub going on  \\n inside of programming.  \\n This is being used as an action,  \\n and there are a bunch of possible events  \\n that as a result of something triggered from your code,  \\n it could be doing something with GitHub  \\n in this particular case.  \\n It could be creating or updating issues,  \\n creating or updating pool requests,  \\n making comments, creating Gists, deleting branches,  \\n doing a review of some kind,  \\n or doing all kinds of different search functions  \\n that are here.  \\n So, these might be useful things for you  \\n if you are working with GitHub  \\n and you want to have your custom code trigger something  \\n inside of GitHub.  \\n Imagine for example, some kind of error is caused  \\n inside of your JavaScript or Python,  \\n that gets logged then to GitHub as an issue for example.  \\n That would be one type of zap you could put together.  \\n GitHub of course can also be a trigger.  \\n When it's a trigger,  \\n there's a whole different set of actions  \\n that are possible here.  \\n So, you can make new organizations, repositories, branches  \\n notifications, mentions, commits,  \\n oh, there's so many things.  \\n Pull requests and review requests and Gists  \\n and all kinds of things that you could do here  \\n with GitHub as the trigger itself.  \\n Another interesting part of Zapier  \\n that's just for programmers, are Web hooks.  \\n So, these Web hooks are available here as a premium feature.  \\n So, it'll be on some of the more expensive Zapier plans  \\n that this is available.  \\n But as you see here, it'll allow you to catch a hook  \\n or catch a raw hook using Post Put or Get to the URLs  \\n or you can retrieval poll in this particular case.  \\n And you can also of course use Web hooks  \\n as the action as opposed to the trigger,  \\n and of course here you can fire off various events  \\n using Get, Post or Put or some kind of custom request.  \\n Get looks like it's using optional query strings,  \\n Post and Put are both using JSON in order to do that.  \\n There's more here inside of the documentation.  \\n I'm looking here at the top developer tool apps.  \\n Some of these we've already covered in the course  \\n things like Filter, for example,  \\n and I just talked about Code and GitHub,  \\n Paths would allow you to have conditional logic  \\n for your Zap, your Workflows,  \\n we didn't cover it in this course  \\n but it works exactly as it sounds.  \\n You can have a decision point happening  \\n in your Zapier workflow, and things go one way or the other.  \\n If you're interested in monitoring your server with Zapier  \\n this is going to integrate  \\n with all kinds of interesting server monitoring apps  \\n and it could generate whatever you want.  \\n It could generate a notification to slack  \\n or to a text message or an email  \\n or all of the above,  \\n send it it to all kinds of different people.  \\n So, that would be something that you could do pretty easily  \\n and with any of these server monitoring apps.  \\n And of course there's security issues as well,  \\n if you were thinking about single login type of work  \\n a lot of these do single login type of things  \\n and Zapier might be part of your integration  \\n to use any these types of things.  \\n So, that might be something that you would want  \\n to consider integrating for your coding purposes  \\n as part of your programming workflow.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"5.
