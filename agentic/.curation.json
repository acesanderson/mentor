Are you looking for a true job description\\nfor an administrative professional?\\nWell as it turns out, there isn't a formal job description.\\nRather, as an administrative professional,\\nit's your job to support the executive\\nand to make sure that things run well\\nwithout any hitches.\\nSometimes I like to call this a duck swimming in the water.\\nBasically, it's your job to ensure\\nthat everything is smooth on the surface\\nwhile all the necessary wheels are being turned\\nunderneath you.\\n\\nIn other words, you're there to support your executive\\nand to make sure their calendar is up to date.\\nYou're the one in charge of ensuring\\nthat all the right meetings are booked\\nand that they attend those meetings on time,\\nthat they take the necessary phone calls,\\nand that they have all the pertinent information\\nthey need to attend a meeting.\\nYour responsible for preparing budget spreadsheets,\\nPowerPoint presentations, etc.\\nAs you can see, the job of an administrative\\nprofessional is to support the executive in all ways.\\n\\nThere are however some basic duties\\nmost admins will also have like filing, typing,\\nand answering phone calls.\\nWorking as an admin is a prestigious role\\nbecause you touch every aspect of the business\\nand you work side by side as a team player\\nwith your executive working together to accomplish\\nthe same goal.\\nOne great thing about this role is that\\nit's a position that allows for your growth.\\nFor instance, you can start as an entry level\\njunior administrative assistant\\nwith the aim of working your way to the level\\nof a senior executive assistant.\\n\\nKeep in mind, each manager works differently.\\nThe only way you can get your true\\njob description is by discovering the needs\\nof the executive or manager whom you work with.\\nAlthough every administrative professional has\\na generic job description and we know what\\nthose basic things are, a true job description is\\nnot something you can just type up.\\nIt's one that you actually have to sit\\nwith your executive to come up with\\nwhen you start working with them.\\nUnderstand their needs, how they work,\\nhow they operate, how they like things done.\\n\\nSome may want phone calls in the morning.\\nSome may only want to take these calls in the afternoon.\\nSome may want to start work at a certain time\\nwhile some may want to end at a certain time.\\nOnce you get the feel and really start working\\nwith your executive, you'll be able to come up\\nwith a true job description for yourself.\\nAnother important part of this role is that\\nit's one which is never really going to be\\nconstantly rewarded.\\nYou know that when you do a good job you're thanked,\\nbut your main responsibility is to support that executive,\\nmake them look good and make sure\\nthat they're reflected in a positive light.\\n\\nSo the reality is you'll likely be doing a lot\\nof the legwork behind the scenes\\nwhile the executive is the one in the public eye.\\nHowever, when you work as a team with your executive,\\nyou can share in their successes.\\nAlthough they may be the ones presenting,\\nyou'll know you're the one that worked with that executive.\\nAnd guess what?\\nThey know it as well.\\nSo you're going to have to learn every aspect\\nof the business.\\nAnd with that, you'll grow in that position\\nand realize that you're supporting someone fully\\nand are playing a very vital role.\\n\\nYes, an admin professional can be\\na behind the scenes role, but it has a

work for a CFO,\\nyou're going to have access to financial data.\\nIf you work for the CEO,\\nyou're probably going to have access\\nto most of the business data.\\nIf you work for a sales

yourself up\\nfrom being an entry-level administrative professional\\nto becoming a senior-level administrative professional.\\nAnd remember, as always,\\nyou're there to support your executive\\nand

complete it.\\nThe way to delegate is make a list of the projects\\nyou have and the time it will take you to complete them.\\nIf one of those projects requires making copies\\nof something, making presentation binders,\\nordering lunch, booking a meeting room, etc.,\\nthose tasks can be delegated to another person.\\nYou may have more you can delegate\\nthan you actually realize.\\nFor example,

doesn't make total sense right now.\\nIt's a beginning and will take shape as you move forward.\\nThere is something about the act of putting it down on paper\\nor typing it up that activates you in a way\\nthat just dreaming about it, does not.\\n\\nIt also gives you clarity so you can start focusing.\\nLastly, based on what you documented,\\nbegin to formulate specific and measurable goals\\nthat will get you moving in the direction\\nof the vision you just created for yourself.\\nYou may need to do some research to determine next steps.\\nIf for instance you can see yourself\\nin a certain career position,\\ninvestigate the qualifications and educational requirements\\nso that you begin to formulate a plan\\nto attain what is needed.\\n\\nRegularly, you should return to and review your vision.\\nThis will ensure that you are spending your time\\non the things that will move you forward in your life.\\nIt is also beneficial to get a life coach\\nor accountability partner at this pont.\\nA life coach is a professional\\nthat you hire to assist you as you move forward\\nto determine and achieve goals.\\nAn accountability partner can be a friend\\nor a relative that you trust\\nwho helps you to stay true to your commitments.\\n\\nPlease note, that a life coach\\nand an accountability partner can be one in the same.\\nYou will need to share your vision and goals\\nwith whomever you designate to be in this role.\\nVisioning is an important part of your personal\\nand professional development.\\nDon't let other people or circumstances\\ndictate your

phone calls,\\noffice visits, priority emails,\\nor an irate customer who needs attention immediately.\\n\\nWhat is the best way to handle these inevitable distractions\\nwith grace and ease while continuing to be productive?\\nWell I'm glad you asked.\\nHere are some tips to do so.\\nFirst, break down your time\\ninto focused blocks on your calendar.\\nSet aside a specific amount of time,\\neither one hour or two, to work on a priority task.\\nFor example, I may work on cleaning out my inbox\\nfrom eight to 10 a.m. in the morning.\\n\\nThis is the only thing I'm scheduled to do during this time.\\nIf any non-urgent emails come through during that period,\\nI don't read them until my two hours are up.\\nI allow my calls to go to voicemail whenever possible.\\nIf I can close my office door, I do that as well.\\nIf a critical interruption must occur,\\nI handle it quickly and then get back\\nto what I was working on.\\nIt's easier to refocus my attention back on the task,\\nas this was the one thing I was working on.\\n\\nAlso learn to separate urgent matters from important ones.\\nThe urgent matters need to be handled right away\\nor they may cause a detrimental effect on my executive\\nor the business in general.\\nImportant matters need to be dealt with expeditiously,\\nbut can normally be scheduled.\\nOften the person who does the interrupting\\nlabels the item as urgent when in reality it's important\\nand can wait until I am finished\\nworking on the task at hand.\\n\\nIt's up to me to make this determination\\nand ensure all matters are handled professionally.\\nFinally, to support your executive.\\nKeep a sufficient buffer of time in their schedule\\nfor the things you are certain will arise.\\nFor example, if I book back-to-back meetings for my boss,\\nand there is a situation that she has to deal with,\\nmeetings will become backed up\\nand some may even need to be canceled.\\nThat will result in my having\\nto do additional work in rescheduling.\\n\\nManaging interruptions is a necessary part of our jobs\\nas administrative support professionals.\\nThroughout our day we are consistently prioritizing\\nthe various situations that we will encounter.\\nBy having a plan in advance,\\nwe will lower our frustrations and meet each interruption\\nas an opportunity to skillfully\\nmanage our time and

what you have in the works.\\nYou can do this by keeping in touch with your\\nprofessional contacts via email, social media,\\nand face-to-face meetings.\\nSecond, attend networking events, both on and offline.\\nEvery industry has conferences that provide\\nnetworking opportunities.\\nThere are also local meetups and organizations that\\nhold regular events for building your network.\\n\\nThird, hang out at the same places the people you want\\nto connect with can be found.\\nThis creates an opportunity to strike up conversation\\nand connect.\\nThis could be online as well as offline.\\nFourth, networking isn't just about receiving,\\nit's about giving as well.\\nIt's important for you to share your knowledge\\nand expertise and offer to help when you see an opportunity.\\nThere is actually a term for this.\\nIt is called positive networking,\\nwhich means discovering what you can do for someone else.\\n\\nIn other words, networking is not about you and how\\nothers can help you, instead,\\nit's about others and how you can help them.\\nYou could also serve as a connector\\nby introducing people you know.\\nFifth, be a good listener.\\nWe shouldn't try to dominate the conversation\\nby talking about ourselves primarily.\\nWe should, instead, listen to other people talk.\\nPeople naturally love to talk about themselves,\\nso if you can show that you are\\ngenuinely interested in what they have to say,\\nit will help to build that connection.\\n\\nSix, we shouldn't be afraid to ask for what we need.\\nIt's better to be direct in this area and to be upfront.\\nThe answer could be a resounding yes.\\nSeven, you should be thinking about cultivating\\nlong-term relationships that are\\nmutually beneficial for both sides.\\nBy fostering these types of connections,\\nover time you may experience multiple ways in which\\nyou can help each other that you can't even\\nbegin to imagine currently.\\n\\nLastly, you should follow up with everyone you connect with.\\nThis can be done by email, letting the person know\\nit was a pleasure to meet with them.\\nI have personally used networking in several instances\\nto land paid speaking engagements and job opportunities.\\nMost recently, after I won an award for an\\nadministrative professional development program\\nthat I created, I stayed in touch with several people\\nin the organization.\\nThat connection resulted in my speaking\\nat their conference, three years in a row.\\n\\nBuilding your professional network is not about quantity,\\nbut rather about quality.\\nYou

Who should you talk to?  \\n Now, sometimes, that's obvious,  \\n but let's say you want to vent about something at work.  \\n There are only a few appropriate people for this,  \\n so choose wisely,  \\n or maybe you plan to make a change of some sort.  \\n Who are all the people affected by that change?  \\n Have you included them in your communication?  \\n Once you've decided with whom you should communicate,  \\n it's important to think about that person's perspective  \\n and tailor to your audience.  \\n For example, Tatiana and I  \\n have been colleagues and friends for years.  \\n We have deep trust,  \\n and I know that she's a busy person who prioritizes action.  \\n If we need to edit some writing, I can simply say,  \\n \\\"Hey, our deadline's Tuesday.  \\n You edit the odd chapters.  \\n I'll do the even ones. Sound good?\\\"  \\n But with another colleague, Irene, who I don't know as well,  \\n that message might sound bossy or overbearing.  \\n I tailor by softening the language to something like,  \\n \\\"Hey, to get the ball rolling for our Tuesday deadline,  \\n I thought you could edit the odd chapters  \\n and I'll do the even,  \\n but if you had something else in mind, let me know.\\\"  \\n When deciding how to adapt your communication,  \\n consider the think, feel, do model.  \\n What did I want Irene to think? \\\"Mm, time to start editing.\\\"  \\n What do I want her to feel? Respected.  \\n And what do I want her to do? Get started.  \\n Tailor to your listeners' knowledge level  \\n and preconceived notions about the topic  \\n and maybe about you.  \\n Another example.  \\n can be too theoretical, so when I'm speaking to a group,  \\n I try to manage that perception  \\n by including lots of real-world work examples.  \\n Think of a conversation you have coming up soon.  \\n What assumptions might your conversational partner have  \\n about you or the topic?  \\n How much does the person know about the subject?  \\n What do you want the other person to think, to feel, to do?  \\n Let your answers inform the words, the tone,  \\n and the body language you use during the conversation.  \\n If you want to be a great communicator,  \\n begin with the people building block.  \\n Do your best to understand a message  \\n from the other's perspective.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4521949\",\"duration\":194,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"The four building blocks: Message\",\"fileName\":\"4476110_en_US_01_02_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":321,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"After watching this video, you will be able to describe how to choose the best channel for your message and how to provide primary and secondary information to strengthen that message.

the sessions I attended,  \\n the amazing venue, the latest trends?  \\n I wasn't prepared to make a mini presentation.  \\n But giving an update is just that: a mini presentation.  \\n When you

stage for people wanting to listen.  \\n When I was asked for a conference update, I could think,  \\n was there an emerging trend in the sessions?  \\n Was there a particular session I attended  \\n that identified as a game changer?  \\n I need to think of the most important concept  \\n and focus just on that.  \\n In this example that I'm giving you,  \\n since artificial intelligence was the overarching theme,  \\n I could have said,  \\n \\\"Well, AI could be the event organizer next year.\\\"  \\n Now, that will catch attention.  \\n Second, why should your audience care?  \\n Think, what do your stakeholders value?  \\n How will your organization benefit from what you say?  \\n Asking these two questions helped me to edit my comments.  \\n I might have made comments about the cool location  \\n or the attraction of the venue.  \\n But I focused on the cutting-edge technology  \\n presented in the session.  \\n Finally, what are the subpoints  \\n that will make my comments memorable?  \\n Our brains operate well when we think  \\n and receive information in patterns,  \\n and three seems to be the magical retention number.  \\n When you share an update,  \\n consider

tools.  \\n Let me give you an example of what others are doing  \\n with their market research.\\\"  \\n So each of those subpoints I can share details in  \\n that are consistent and concise  \\n and relevant to the audience.  \\n Since an update is a mini presentation,  \\n you will want to be sure to wrap up  \\n with the point that reinforces your opening line  \\n and opens the conversation to additional questions.  \\n I would've said something like,  \\n \\\"AI is moving very fast  \\n and it can help us with all aspects of our business.  \\n Overall, it was a great

increase your visibility  \\n and boost effectiveness  \\n during the many, many meetings you attend.  \\n John has to attend a ton of meetings,  \\n and here we see him sitting in his usual corner spot.  \\n He's listening but not saying much,  \\n trying not to take up too much space.  \\n People might leave this meeting  \\n and not even remember that John attended.  \\n But with some simple changes,  \\n he'll get noticed and add value to these meetings.  \\n These tips will help you as well.  \\n First, arrive early and take a seat in the center.  \\n Corners are psychological weak spots  \\n according to Preston Ni,  \\n a communication professor and executive coach.  \\n If you're meeting online, be sure your camera is on.  \\n Greet people by name as they enter,  \\n whether face to face or virtually.  \\n Next, check your seat height.  \\n Bring your chair level with others at the table  \\n or so that your camera has a good view  \\n of your face and upper torso.  \\n Consider whether your posture is communicating interest  \\n and engagement or boredom.  \\n Make some small talk as people arrive,  \\n even in the chat function.  \\n Getting to know people  \\n or building rapport is a good reason  \\n to have a meeting instead of an email.  \\n Use people's names during the meeting,  \\n and they won't forget that you were there.  \\n Notice how John shows his attentiveness by taking notes.  \\n Be careful when on camera though,  \\n when note taking may look like you're just distracted.  \\n Smile at speakers.  \\n See what a difference these changes make  \\n to John's visibility.  \\n Along with increased visibility,  \\n you can improve the problem solving  \\n and decision making at your meetings.  \\n The best decisions are those based  \\n on all the relevant information known in the room.  \\n But according to research by Stasser and Titus,  \\n that happens less than 20% of the time, why?  \\n Because groups tend to focus on shared information.  \\n Individually known but vital information  \\n tends to get withheld or overlooked in meetings.  \\n Here's what I mean.  \\n At John's meeting, he knows three pieces  \\n of relevant information for the problem they're working on,  \\n A, B, and C.  \\n Chris knows A, B, and D.  \\n While Lauren knows A, C, and E.  \\n The best solution requires knowing A, B, C, D, and E.  \\n But in most meetings,  \\n information A, which all three people know,  \\n will get discussed a lot.  \\n B and C will get some airtime  \\n because at least two people in the meeting know about that.  \\n But D and E, the information that only one person knows,  \\n is likely never to be heard.  \\n That's the common knowledge bias.  \\n Now, here's what you can do.  \\n Acknowledge the bias.  \\n Remind your other attendees  \\n that just because something is commonly known to the group,  \\n it doesn't make it the only important information.  \\n Probe for the hidden treasure.  \\n Try saying, \\\"Sounds like we all came in  \\n knowing about A and B.  \\n It would be great to hear something  \\n that hasn't surfaced yet, somebody surprise us.\\\"  \\n Pay attention to nonverbal cues.  \\n When you notice someone looking pensive,  \\n hold space for them.  \\n Say something like, \\\"Wait, John, did you have a thought?\\\"  \\n Express gratitude and respect for diverse ideas.  \\n When someone shares something unique,  \\n don't let it get dismissed.  \\n Common information seems more valid.  \\n It's like, \\\"Well, we all know this fact,  \\n so it must be true.\\\"  \\n Don't let that bias derail your attempt  \\n to unearth unique knowledge.  \\n Say, \\\"Thanks, John.  \\n That's the first time this has come up  \\n and I think we should talk about it.\\\"  \\n You can create an environment  \\n where people feel safe to share.  \\n Practice three then me to equalize talk time  \\n and allow everyone a chance to contribute.  \\n Once you've spoken, don't talk again  \\n until at least three other people have shared.  \\n Use these tips and you'll see your visibility go up  \\n and decision making improve.  \\n Now those are meetings worth attending.  \\n

- My daughter Molina recently graduated from college  \\n and has been conducting informative interviews  \\n to gather career advice.  \\n What Molina didn't realize  \\n was that she was getting a crash course on rapport building.  \\n Even if you're not in her shoes,  \\n using rapport- building skills  \\n will benefit you in any situation  \\n when you are connecting with other people.  \\n Here's some tips to use in your next conversation.  \\n Find or build on common ground.  \\n When you connect with someone you don't know well,  \\n start with discussing the external environment  \\n or a common context.  \\n For example, I recently encountered  \\n a group of women in a hotel elevator  \\n who were all wearing historical costumes.  \\n I opened with, \\\"I must have missed the invitation.  \\n Have you all been having fun?\\\"  \\n This led to an engaging conversation about their evening.  \\n If you are more familiar with the person,  \\n you can initiate a conversation on a more personal note.  \\n Follow up on a previous topic  \\n or something specific from your last conversation.  \\n For instance, if they mention their kids' birthday party,  \\n ask how it went.  \\n I often use the note section on my phone  \\n and I document things like names of spouses,  \\n or kids' grade levels, degrees, colleges.  \\n This allows me to make more personalized comments.  \\n Leverage virtual connections.  \\n Strategize about your virtual connections  \\n as much as you do with your in-person ones.  \\n A comment about a post or article  \\n in someone's LinkedIn page,  \\n A separate private message thanking them  \\n for sharing information or even passing along an article  \\n you think they may be interested in  \\n are all examples of virtual rapport building.  \\n Show interest and engagement.  \\n Our listening building block in this course is essential  \\n when you are building rapport.  \\n Listen with your whole body.  \\n Nod, lean in.  \\n Encourage the speaker verbally with words such as,  \\n \\\"Really?\\\"  \\n \\\"Wow.\\\" \\\"Oh, I see.\\\"  \\n Don't neglect eye contact  \\n and varying your facial expressions  \\n just because the meeting is virtual.  \\n Yes, they can be incredibly exhausting,  \\n but a direct camera connection is crucial  \\n to successfully engaging with others.  \\n Voice inflection and energy also matter.  \\n If you're in an audio only meeting or on the phone,  \\n your vocal inflection is your only tool  \\n for conveying friendliness.  \\n I found it interesting that a study  \\n in the \\\"Journal of Evolution and Human Behavior\\\"  \\n looked at the relationship of voice pitch  \\n and trustworthiness in different social contexts.  \\n They found that an enthusiastic vocal pitch  \\n can convey energy, engagement and sincerity.  \\n If you don't know  \\n how your conversational vocal pitch comes across,  \\n record an audio sample of yourself  \\n and feed it into an AI tool such as Yulee  \\n or AI to get valuable feedback about your speaking style.  \\n Finally, stand or sit tall.  \\n Strong posture and a steady gaze  \\n tell everyone around that you're comfortable and attentive.  \\n Practice these tips daily to become comfortable  \\n with building rapport.  \\n It will increase your network  \\n and enhance your professional growth.  \\n In the Toolkit video

- Let's begin with what I call neutral context drills.  \\n Next time you're at an airport,  \\n find someone nearby who you can share something in common.  \\n Maybe they have the same briefcase,  \\n or they're wearing the same team logo on their shirt,  \\n or the same watch.  \\n If appropriate. make eye contact and greet them,  \\n and comment about the item you have in common.  \\n Your goal is to use the common item to create rapport.  \\n If the person is responding positively,  \\n continue discussing the common item  \\n and then switch to some open-ended questions.  \\n For example, if you're sitting across  \\n from a person wearing your favorite team shirt, you can say,  \\n \\\"You are also a fan?  \\n Did you watch the game last night?\\\"  \\n See if you can maintain the conversation  \\n for two to three minutes.  \\n Now, practice this drill each time you travel,  \\n or you're in a similar social setting.  \\n Now, let's move to workplace context drills.  \\n Go to your next meeting committed to ignoring your phone,  \\n your tablet, and other electronics.  \\n Instead, tune into the people.  \\n Make a point to ask an open-ended question  \\n to the person on your right.  \\n Do this for three consecutive meetings.  \\n Keep the conversation light.  \\n Ask and encourage the other person to talk.  \\n Practice your open gestures, your stance,  \\n and your nonverbals.  \\n Practice your listening injections, those ahas, yeah.  \\n Stay attentive with your eyes.  \\n Finally, let's focus on drills you can use  \\n in other professional contexts.  \\n At the next professional conference  \\n or meeting you attend,  \\n find three people you haven't met before  \\n and try to connect with them.  \\n At first, comment on the environment,  \\n maybe the keynote speaker  \\n or a news piece related to your industry.  \\n Follow up with open-ended questions about them  \\n and their work.  \\n Practice repeating their names a few times,  \\n or ask them something specific about their name.  \\n Think of a visual or a verbal reminder  \\n to help you retain that name.  \\n After your conversation,  \\n make note in your contacts  \\n so you can follow up with them later.  \\n Being comfortable communicating in any social setting  \\n is not easy, but you will get better with practice.  \\n Use these drills to

- Annabel Acton, a Forbes contributor,  \\n said she likes her email like her dentist visits,  \\n short, to the point, and only when necessary.  \\n That's great advice for most of our digital communication.  \\n Use these tips when emailing, texting, or messaging.  \\n Consider your communication building blocks,  \\n starting with people.  \\n Who really needs your message?  \\n If action is not required by your reader,  \\n do they really need this?  \\n What do you want your reader to think, feel, and do?  \\n What preconceived notions do your readers have about you  \\n or the topic of this message?  \\n Your answers to these questions clearly define  \\n what you hope to achieve.  \\n If you plan to use an AI writing assistant,  \\n this clarity helps create an effective prompt  \\n and very specific instructions.  \\n Next, think about which channel  \\n is best for your message.  \\n Chat, or text for very short updates or requests like,  \\n I'm ready, or, can you meet on the 15th?  \\n Chat is so informal  \\n that it's tempting to ignore customary grammar  \\n or punctuation, don't do it.  \\n Clarity and professionalism are your goals, always.  \\n It's okay to use an occasional emoji to express emotion  \\n with the right reader, but do so sparingly.  \\n Use your company's collaboration apps  \\n for messages connected to specific projects  \\n or when you need feedback from lots of people.  \\n If some of your intended readers  \\n aren't great about checking the collaborative space,  \\n use @ mentions with their names so they get notifications.  \\n Include a read me first or table of contents document  \\n in collaborative spaces  \\n that have lots of files and messages.  \\n Writing a summation document  \\n is something that your AI writing assistant could do well.  \\n When sending email, write short subject lines,  \\n just four to five words  \\n that tell the reader the most important information  \\n like response needed by Wednesday,  \\n or agenda for litigation meeting.  \\n Your reader should be able to find your message  \\n with just a quick scan of their inbox.  \\n Regardless of the channel you choose,  \\n carefully organize your thoughts.  \\n Most written communication can follow this pattern,  \\n message first, action next, and details, third.  \\n Isha, a project manager, sent this message to her team.  \\n Your activity report is mandatory and due Wednesday.  \\n Now this is the bottom line message  \\n of interest to her readers.  \\n Then in her very next sentence,  \\n she makes the action clear and easy to follow.  \\n Complete the attached report and email it to me  \\n by noon on Wednesday.  \\n She thought about ending here,  \\n but Isha is aware that some people on her team  \\n think these reports are a waste of time.  \\n She decides to add a claim and some evidence  \\n from an expert to back up her claim.  \\n I spoke with the VP who assures me  \\n that these reports are used by our managers  \\n during performance evals.  \\n Include enough evidence to convince your reader  \\n that your claims are correct.  \\n Supporting evidence can be an example,  \\n expert opinion, voice of the customer data,  \\n financials, or case studies.  \\n Isha organized for action and supported for credibility.  \\n Before sending, though,  \\n she edits for tone and accuracy.  \\n She changes one pronoun, your activity report, to our,  \\n then she changed one adjective,  \\n she deleted mandatory, and she adds a please.  \\n Voila, the tone is now still direct, but also polite.  \\n Finally, don't forget to format wisely and to proofread.  \\n Add formatting like bullet points, bold font, headers,  \\n or text boxes and lines  \\n to draw your reader's attention to key ideas.  \\n It's easy to skim right over mistakes,  \\n seeing only what we meant to write.  \\n Make it a game to find mistakes  \\n so that your proofing protects your credibility.  \\n Let's remember Anabel Acton's analogy  \\n and aim to make our written communication  \\n as efficient and impactful as a quick dental visit.  \\n

 \\n Or is this someone who is more emotional  \\n and makes decisions by processing the effects on people?  \\n Head or heart, thinker or feeler?  \\n Your thinker needs evidence, facts,  \\n comparisons, and benchmarks.  \\n For example, these are the three most popular  \\n platforms in our industry.  \\n The heart decision maker needs  \\n to make sure people will benefit, values will be honored,  \\n and harmony will be upheld.  \\n Here's some comments from our engagement survey  \\n pointing to people's frustration with our system.  \\n Then consider your message.  \\n A great pattern of organization when pitching  \\n an idea is the what, why, how one.  \\n Immediately overview the what of your suggestion.  \\n Then give two to three compelling reasons  \\n why your idea is a good one.  \\n Back up those reasons with solid evidence, statistics,  \\n industry data, case studies, and specific examples.  \\n Make sure these reasons are aligned with the values  \\n and priorities of your decision maker.  \\n And finally, explain to your decision maker  \\n how your idea can be implemented.  \\n Prove feasibility.  \\n What, why, how.  \\n Your pitch may sound something like this.  \\n We need to think about transitioning to a teams  \\n or slack type of platform for our internal communication.  \\n I know that last week you stayed late trying to find  \\n those customer files buried in your email threads.  \\n One of those new platforms will help us improve response  \\n time by 50% and will decrease negative comments  \\n in our year end engagement survey.  \\n So let's meet with our IT folks  \\n and get them to help us transition and train the staff  \\n before the end of the month.  \\n And that's how you use the what, why, how pattern.  \\n Now when you influence, we also want you  \\n to consider the context building block.  \\n Think carefully about your timing  \\n and location of your message delivery.  \\n So the communication platform idea should not reach your  \\n manager when they are burdened with a hundred other things  \\n and definitely not after the end of the meeting  \\n or in a hallway encounter.  \\n Timing and context matter when you try to influence.  \\n Finally, remember our listening building block.  \\n Train yourself to ask questions, talk less  \\n and listen to deeply understand the needs  \\n of those we're trying to influence.  \\n The communication platform example  \\n is a simple tactical idea.  \\n However, some of your pitches may be more complex.  \\n The same principles apply,  \\n but your pitch may need to evolve into more of a campaign.  \\n You may need to recruit other members of your team  \\n to help you pitch, do additional research  \\n and add to the conversations with your manager  \\n to help influence their approval.  \\n Take the time to strategize.  \\n Use the what, why, how formula,  \\n and always consider your audience's needs.  \\n The toolkit following has a great practice drill  \\n that you can work on.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4520983\",\"duration\":112,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Tool kit: Pitching your ideas\",\"fileName\":\"4476110_en_US_02_10_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":307,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"After watching this video, you will be able to practice putting together a pitch for one of your ideas.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":5596064,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Quick, look around your space.  \\n Pick three items, literally three items, like a pen  \\n or a pack of sticky notes, or even a coffee mug.  \\n Three items.  \\n Now, think of the audience.  \\n Think of someone in the service industry, for example,  \\n that you interact with.  \\n Maybe it's the barista at your regular coffee shop.  \\n If they don't have sticky notes  \\n and you want to suggest that they buy them,  \\n could you craft a what, why, how message for them?

 \\n Or is it solid enough to handle differing viewpoints?  \\n Second, consider the power dynamics.  \\n If you are in a leadership role and you fail to listen,  \\n empathize, or appreciate diverse perspectives,  \\n you may appear dictatorial.  \\n Similarly, if your boss holds a different viewpoint  \\n and you can't express your disagreement tactfully,  \\n it might be wiser to remain silent.  \\n In a few words, choose your battles carefully.  \\n So here are three steps to consider  \\n as you find yourself disagreeing with someone.  \\n Step one, prepare, before a tough conversation  \\n that's likely to create disagreements,  \\n list some possible assumptions that you're making.  \\n Then make a list of three positive intents  \\n that the person may have.  \\n Mark Goulston the author of a Harvard Business Review  \\n article on how not to get defensive,  \\n suggests that you ignore the initial two reactions.  \\n The first one is likely to be defensive,  \\n and your second one is likely to be accusatory.  \\n Lead with the third thing that comes to mind,  \\n because by then you're focusing on problem solving.  \\n If you have time, practice what you plan to say  \\n to a trusted friend or colleague.  \\n Pace, enter the conversation being mindful  \\n of your pace and your emotion.  \\n Ask questions to help you understand  \\n where the person is coming from.  \\n Acknowledge the other person's position  \\n and show that you appreciate it.  \\n Express your point of view and reasoning  \\n calmly and factually, but avoid making judgements.  \\n Listen intently, hold your position lightly,  \\n and even express some appreciation.  \\n Process, what you do after a contentious conversation  \\n is as important as what you do during it.  \\n Move beyond disagreement towards problem solving,  \\n mutual action and understanding.  \\n Reflect on how you handle the situation,  \\n and if you need to adjust your approach  \\n for the next time the disagreement comes up.  \\n Our natural tendency is to avoid conflict,  \\n whether it involves our boss or a good colleague,  \\n but as noted by the authors of the very popular book,  \\n Crucial Conversations, our greatest risk  \\n is to remain silent.  \\n Practice the prepare, pace, and process steps,  \\n so the next time you get into a disagreement,  \\n you'll be prepared to speak up effectively and tactfully.  \\n Now, make sure to check out the toolkit  \\n in the upcoming video, where you can test these techniques  \\n in a variety of situations and topics.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4521952\",\"duration\":178,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Tool kit: Managing disagreement\",\"fileName\":\"4476110_en_US_03_04_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"4476110_en_US_03_04_DisagreeScenario_01_A.mov\\n4476110_en_US_03_04_DisagreeScenario_01_B.mov\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":true,\"rawDurationSeconds\":142,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"After watching this video, you will be able to practice verbiage and structure that allows you to be diplomatic while getting your point across.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":9902093,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Prepare, pace, and process.  \\n Watch me work through these steps  \\n in a conversation with Brenda.  \\n Then make a list of topics  \\n and the people you will practice with.  \\n Brenda is playing the role of our human resources director  \\n who wants us to follow a standard training agenda  \\n for the onboarding training we trainers conduct.  \\n I believe that we should allow our human resources trainers  \\n to add their own personal stories and anecdotes.  \\n Prepare.  \\n I feel strongly about this.  \\n I always bring my stories into training content,  \\n and I think that a formal agenda  \\n would make the onboarding experience boring,  \\n but what exactly does Brenda have in mind?

 \\n Want an introduction to someone?  \\n Our work lives are filled with opportunities  \\n to ask for what we need, and yet, for many of us,  \\n advocating for ourselves is tough.  \\n We worry that we'll look bad if we need to ask for help,  \\n even though research shows that if you ask for help  \\n with a simple task,  \\n it has no effect on how people perceive your competency.  \\n And if you ask for help with a complex job,  \\n it actually increases the perception of your competency.  \\n We also worry that people will tell us no,  \\n but we underestimate how many people are willing to help us  \\n and the amount of effort they're willing to expend.  \\n Even if someone does turn us down,  \\n a no is not the end of the world.  \\n Women tend to ask for things  \\n that they need even less often than men do,  \\n according to numerous studies.  \\n How can we become better at making polite requests?  \\n Well, remember your four building blocks.  \\n People.  \\n Consider how this request might affect the other person.  \\n Message.  \\n Try to make your request face-to-face.  \\n In-person requests are 34 times more successful than email.  \\n When it's time to ask for what you need,  \\n be direct and polite.  \\n Our third building block was context.  \\n Is the timing and location right for you to make an ask?  \\n And then listening, you are making the request,  \\n but this is a conversation.  \\n Be sure to listen attentively  \\n when the other person responds.  \\n Now, once you've thought through the building blocks,  \\n jump right in.  \\n Say something like, \\\"I need a favor.  \\n Can you show me how to enter these invoices?\\\"  \\n Give a reason for your request.  \\n I've tried doing it two or three different ways,  \\n and I'm worried that I'm messing up the whole system.  \\n Give the person an out.  \\n More important than any favor  \\n is maintaining good relationships.  \\n Provide an escape clause  \\n so the other person can decline  \\n without it being too awkward.  \\n If this is a bad time, I can keep plugging away at it.  \\n And then make the next steps obvious and easy.  \\n I love it when someone asks me for a recommendation letter  \\n and they've already sketched out a rough draft  \\n of what the letter might say.  \\n They make my job so easy that I'm more inclined to say yes.  \\n So a request put all together might sound like this.  \\n Could you review the presentation I've been working on?

 \\n These tips will help.  \\n First, buy time before responding.  \\n The trick to avoiding a verbal blunder  \\n or overcommitting yourself  \\n is to build a delay  \\n between something popping into your head  \\n and popping out of your mouth.  \\n Take a sip of water.  \\n Say something like, \\\"This is catching me off guard.  \\n \\\"Give me until tomorrow to think about it.\\\"  \\n If you must respond on the spot, say things like,  \\n \\\"Tell me more about that,\\\"  \\n or, \\\"Help me understand your thinking.\\\"  \\n While your conversational partner is responding,  \\n you can take a moment to regulate your emotions.  \\n My face reads like an open book,  \\n but in some contexts  \\n it's better not to share everything I'm feeling.  \\n Self-regulate when you're about to yell, cry, storm out,  \\n or say something out of line.  \\n Silently inhale for a count of four.  \\n Exhale for a count of four.  \\n This counted breath will bring your heart rate down  \\n and erase a lot of the emotion showing on your face.  \\n Break eye contact.  \\n Look at the wall or your feet.  \\n Write down key words the other person is saying.  \\n And for a neutral face,  \\n relax your eyebrows, which furrow when you're upset;  \\n drop your tongue away from the roof of your mouth,  \\n which will unlock your jaw,  \\n and neutralize your expression.  \\n Relax your shoulders.  \\n Now you're ready to respond to tough questions.  \\n Answer hard questions with this three-part formula:  \\n \\\"Here's what I do know.  \\n \\\"I don't know about what you asked,  \\n \\\"but here's how I will find out.\\\"  \\n This \\\"I don't know\\\" formula preserves your credibility  \\n while being honest about what you don't know.  \\n It might sound like this.  \\n - Hey, Brenda, why on earth did the numbers  \\n get included for the Southwest region on these projections?  \\n - I, well, you know,  \\n I know we have been including  \\n some regional data on those reports.  \\n I'm not sure why Southwest is there,  \\n but I will call Chris in finance and find out.  \\n Now you have a credible way  \\n to manage questions when you don't have answers.  \\n You could probably tell that Tatiana,  \\n in our hypothetical scenario,  \\n was unhappy with my performance.  \\n Let's look at how to deal with criticism.  \\n Feedback is a gift,  \\n but it sometimes feels like a slap in the face.  \\n When someone is courageous enough  \\n to give us their honest opinion,  \\n even if we disagree with it,  \\n even if they didn't say it very tactfully,  \\n begin by saying, \\\"Thank you for the feedback.\\\"  \\n Then clarify vague or confusing criticism  \\n using the SBI model.  \\n The SBI, or Situation Behavior Impact model,  \\n is a tool taught by the Center for Creative Leadership  \\n to give feedback to others.  \\n I've found it works great to get clear feedback as well.  \\n When someone criticizes you  \\n and you're not even sure what they're talking about,  \\n ask for situations when they've noticed a specific behavior.  \\n Or if you understand what behavior they're criticizing  \\n but you aren't sure why it's a problem, ask,  \\n what impact did that behavior have?

of the more advanced features of SharePoint.  \\n And this listen, I'm going to show you how to use sections  \\n and web parts to add more features  \\n within your SharePoint site.  \\n To get started, I'll open SharePoint.  \\n I've already created a communication site  \\n and named it skills conference page  \\n for an upcoming conference.  \\n Now I want to change the layout  \\n and look of the site and add some content.  \\n I want to start by changing the layout on this page.  \\n The layout of a SharePoint page is made up  \\n of different sections.  \\n Sections are distinct areas on the page  \\n and each component in a section is called a web part.  \\n Before I can make any changes, I need to go  \\n to the top right corner and select edit,  \\n on the left bar I can edit my sections.  \\n I simply click the plus and options open up,  \\n I can add, edit, move, duplicate,  \\n or delete a section from here.  \\n I want to remove one of my sections,  \\n so I'll scroll down to the section  \\n I'd like to remove, select it,  \\n and in the options on the far left, select delete.  \\n I can see the section has been deleted.  \\n Now I want to edit the web part  \\n in the section at the top of this page,  \\n this web part is a hero which allows you to display  \\n up to five items using text, images, and links.  \\n To edit this web part  \\n I'll select it and select edit web part,  \\n I can display my hero web part as tiles or layers.  \\n Selecting tiles displays my hero with images and links,  \\n selecting layers displays my hero with images,  \\n text, and links.  \\n I want to display text and images,  \\n so I'll keep layers selected from my layout options.  \\n One of the features that makes SharePoint so useful  \\n is you can easily edit when you need to add more content.  \\n Currently, my site has three layers.  \\n A layer contains an image, text, and a link.  \\n I only have a small amount of content that I want to share,  \\n so I only need one layer.  \\n So under layout, I will choose the one layer layout.  \\n Now that I've got the right layout,  \\n I can start to edit the image,  \\n text, and link for my web part.  \\n To edit the individual components of a web part,  \\n I need to go to edit web part details.  \\n I need to select the web part  \\n and find the edit details button,  \\n once selected an edit menu pops up with the edit options,  \\n right now I don't need to link anything,  \\n so I want to remove the link.  \\n I just need to go down to the options menu and expand it,  \\n for this web part the link is actually  \\n a part of a call to action,  \\n so to remove the link  \\n I'll just select no for show call to action link.  \\n When I'm ready to add a link I can move show call to action  \\n to yes, and add my link and call to action  \\n text when I'm ready.  \\n I want to change the text for this web part,  \\n so I'll edit the title and description  \\n to be specific to

Because the biggest obstacle  \\n to effective time management  \\n isn't that we lack enough time to get things done.  \\n It's that we're trying to do too many things  \\n in the time we have available.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3042383\",\"duration\":131,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Reducing the costs of switchtasking\",\"fileName\":\"2423850_en_US_02_02_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn the three primary costs of switchtasking (or multitasking) to create early awareness of the costs of attention switches, and discover the power this course has in helping you reduce these switches.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2004360,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Multitasking, or more accurately, switchtasking,  \\n forces us to pay switching costs.  \\n Hidden time expenses we pile up hundreds of times per day.  \\n There are three main switching costs to switchtasking.  \\n First, the amount of time  \\n it takes to complete things increases, in some cases,  \\n up to twice as long as the first time.  \\n Consider an everyday occurrence.  \\n You're responding to an email from a coworker,  \\n you're crafting a careful response,  \\n and then a text message comes in.  \\n Most will stop typing the email and check the message.  \\n They send a quick reply,  \\n then they have to return to the email and do what?  \\n Reread what they wrote, get their mind in the right place,  \\n and continue writing.  \\n This costs a lot of extra time,  \\n maybe a five minute loss or more.  \\n And when you consider Microsoft research  \\n found that workers on average switch apps 566 times per day,  \\n you can see how lost time starts to accumulate.  \\n Second, the quality of the work decreases,  \\n or the likelihood of mistakes increases.  \\n How many times at work  \\n have you seen someone given very clear instructions,  \\n yet they still messed it up?  \\n Frustrating, right?  \\n As I consult companies,  \\n I've found that when intelligent people  \\n make obvious mistakes, it's almost always  \\n a symptom of switchtasking, not incompetence.  \\n The third cost of switchtasking is stress.  \\n Switchtasking makes everything more stressful.  \\n Even with something as simple  \\n as copying numbers and letters on a piece of paper.  \\n We have so many ways to reduce stress,  \\n and so many time-saving devices,  \\n and yet we're more stressed than we've ever been.  \\n A big part of that  \\n is because of the cultural acceptance of switchtasking.  \\n Switchtasking is a thief.

In my decades of consulting people and organizations,  \\n I found there are six fundamentals to help you get the most  \\n out of your calendar.  \\n First, think of your calendar as your time budget.  \\n When you schedule things into your calendar,  \\n think of it like withdrawing money from a bank account.  \\n We each have a maximum weekly limit of 168 hours.  \\n We need to live within that limit and never overdraw.  \\n Otherwise we go into time debt  \\n and must pay interest on time.  \\n When we try to do too many things in too little time,  \\n we pay lots of switching costs.  \\n Things take longer, we make more mistakes  \\n and we increase our stress.  \\n Use the calendar to track your time withdrawals  \\n so you can avoid overspending.  \\n This leads to the second principle,  \\n avoid double booking yourself.  \\n There's only one of you  \\n so don't try to schedule two things at once.  \\n Otherwise, you create lots of time debt and switching cost.  \\n Third, never commit to an appointment  \\n without putting it into your calendar.  \\n Sometimes people casually say something like,  \\n \\\"Let's do lunch next week.\\\"  \\n If you don't put that in your calendar,  \\n you put pressure on your mind to keep track of it  \\n which often leads to lost time and feeling overwhelmed.  \\n If it's important to you, if it must be done, schedule it.  \\n Fourth, schedule buffer and travel time.  \\n Avoid having appointments that are back to back to back  \\n to back, one o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock  \\n with no room to breathe between them.  \\n Leave space for unexpected interruptions  \\n or just a moment to relax.  \\n And if you must physically travel from one meeting  \\n to the next, schedule that on your calendar.  \\n Fifth, think of your calendar as a commitment to others  \\n and to yourself.  \\n Stick to the time you budget in your calendar.  \\n The calendar isn't a place for tentative or perhaps.  \\n It's a place for you to choose what you'll do  \\n and when you'll do it.  \\n And if you're not committed yet, don't schedule it.  \\n And finally think long term.  \\n Most feel like they don't have enough time  \\n to get everything done because they're thinking in terms  \\n of what can be done within two weeks.  \\n As you open your perspective to months and years from now,  \\n you'll realize you have an abundance of time.  \\n Schedule deeper into the future.  \\n These six mindsets lay the groundwork  \\n for using your calendar productively.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3049051\",\"duration\":120,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Saying no to others\",\"fileName\":\"2423850_en_US_05_03_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to develop a plan for saying no to others to help you stay focused on prior commitments, and still maintain positive relationships while creating healthy boundaries.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":1849607,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

 \\n Well, I need to open my slide deck  \\n and make adjustments.  \\n When will it be done?  \\n This definitely needs to be scheduled  \\n for two reasons.  \\n It will take me more than 15 minutes  \\n and it has a deadline.  \\n The event is six months from now  \\n but I should get it done a little ahead of time.  \\n So I open my calendar and schedule an hour  \\n to work on it four months in the future,  \\n leaving buffer time on each side.  \\n Where is its home?  \\n Well, I already have a previous version saved  \\n so I make a note in my appointment  \\n where the digital file is located.  \\n And this note to myself.  \\n Well, that goes in the recycling bin.  \\n When in doubt, if physical, throw it out.  \\n Now it's processed.  \\n Here's one more quick example.  \\n Another note I made to myself  \\n to follow up with Angelina, a CEO.  \\n She's interested in receiving coaching  \\n and wanted me to check back in a few months.  \\n I ask, what's the next step?

 \\n It's very possible though.  \\n Most of my clients do this.  \\n First, set a recurring appointment in your schedule  \\n for processing.  \\n My recommended weekly allowance  \\n of processing is about five hours a week.  \\n Try five hours a week for a couple of weeks  \\n and then adjust as needed.  \\n I know this may sound like a lot  \\n but remember processing is just another word for deciding,  \\n deciding what, when and where.  \\n Most people already spend 10 to 15 hours per week processing  \\n because they constantly switch their attention  \\n from decision to decision.  \\n This system asks you to spend less processing time  \\n by doing it in a more focused way.  \\n When should those five hours per week happen?  \\n Most jobs have natural ebbs and flows.  \\n Aim for times when you're least likely to be interrupted.  \\n So if you're not usually interrupted first thing  \\n in the morning, you could test processing  \\n from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, Monday through Friday.  \\n That would give you five hours a week.  \\n I recommend blocks of at least one hour at a time.  \\n Most people get into a productive processing rhythm  \\n at around the 25 minute mark.  \\n When you process for at least an hour at a time,  \\n you'll make the most of that rhythm.  \\n I personally prefer scheduling two large chunks  \\n of time on Monday and Friday for processing.  \\n Give a schedule a try, then adjust over time.  \\n Pause this video and create a recurring schedule  \\n in your calendar for processing  \\n at least least five hours each week.  \\n Then come back for one last step.  \\n Okay. We're almost done.  \\n What about the backlog of all those boxes?  \\n During the initial gathering, you may have finished  \\n with several boxes, perhaps dozens.  \\n Also, if you completed the mind clearing exercise,  \\n you have gathered dozens of incomplete tasks to a notepad  \\n or other gathering point.  \\n This means you'll need to spend extra time processing,  \\n just this once.  \\n Generally, you'll schedule one extra hour  \\n per large unfinished box  \\n and one hour for every 30 unresolved tasks you gathered  \\n from your mind.  \\n So if you had five box boxes beyond your normal inbox  \\n and 60 unresolved tasks, you'll need about eight extra hours  \\n for processing.  \\n Don't try to do it all now.  \\n A good target to aim for  \\n is completing this backlog processing within the next month.  \\n Yes, it'll take some work to get to zero  \\n but the payoff is amazing.  \\n It's a liberating feeling  \\n and one I'd love for you to experience.  \\n So go to your calendar and schedule that extra time  \\n for your backlog processing.  \\n It'll be worth it.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"8.

 \\n Visit the site.  \\n When will it be done?  \\n Well, I want to put some thought into this.  \\n It may take me 30 minutes.  \\n Since that's more than 15, I know it must be calendared.  \\n I open the calendar, create a new appointment  \\n and enter the email info.  \\n By the way, some email apps that are integrated  \\n with a calendar may allow me to drag the email  \\n to the calendar.  \\n I schedule 30 minutes making sure I have buffer time  \\n on either side so I don't overschedule.  \\n If I wanted to, I could color categorize this  \\n to identify the kind of work I'm doing, but that's optional.  \\n Finally, where is its home?  \\n Well all processed email except for obvious deletions  \\n go into the archive.  \\n Now it's your turn.  \\n Pause the course and practice what, when,  \\n where processing your email for one hour.  \\n The time spent will help you develop a lasting,  \\n productive habit.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3046335\",\"duration\":164,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Processing email vs. checking email\",\"fileName\":\"2423850_en_US_09_05_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to create a plan and a system for doing quick spot checks of email to help you stay on top of everything that is time sensitive, while appropriately delaying responses to everything else.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":2496720,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - At this point,  \\n If you haven't, please pause  \\n and schedule this before proceeding.  \\n Because our goal is to bring your email inbox to zero,  \\n at least once per week,  \\n you'll likely need to do a little catch up.  \\n But first, we may need to make your inbox more manageable  \\n if it holds hundred or thousands of emails.  \\n So let's archive everything older  \\n than a reasonable date of your choice.  \\n Maybe everything older than two months.  \\n Use your app's search engine and ask it to display  \\n everything older than your chosen date,  \\n select them all, and then click archive.  \\n Then schedule extra processing  \\n spread out over the next month  \\n to catch up with everything left in your inbox.  \\n Typically one hour  \\n per 100 unprocessed emails is about right.  \\n Pause this video to schedule that extra time.  \\n Now let's discuss processing email versus checking email.  \\n This also applies to messages.  \\n At this point  \\n you've already scheduled your regular processing time  \\n around five hours per week.  \\n But what about email and messages  \\n that arrive before your scheduled processing.  \\n Checking email is different than processing.  \\n It's just looking at your email and answering one question,  \\n \\\"Can this wait?\\\"  \\n Meaning, can this wait until my scheduled processing time?

before.\\nHave you ever spaced out while you were in school\\nor when someone was talking to you?\\nThat's passive listening.\\nYou're hearing the words,\\nbut you're not really understanding much.\\nActive listening requires focus,\\nso you first need to make sure\\nthat you try to eliminate distractions.\\n\\nThat may include turning off your phone\\nor getting rid of your laptop\\nif you absolutely don't need it during the meeting.\\nAnd I'm not just talking about putting your phone on vibrate\\nbecause even that can distract you\\nfrom actively listening.\\nI've heard of some companies that even\\ncollect cell phones at the door before the meeting starts\\njust to ensure people don't get distracted.\\nGetting rid of distractions\\nwill help you listen with more focus.\\nActive listening also requires\\nthe right kind of body language.\\nLeaning in, nodding at the appropriate moments\\nand maintaining eye contact are all great ways\\nto stay attentive.\\n\\nAnother key to listening is paraphrasing\\nand repeating back what you heard,\\nor to ask questions that clarify what's being discussed.\\nWhile you're listening, you also want\\nto be on the lookout for main points\\nthat are being discussed.\\nListen for statements like the thing to remember is,\\nor phrases like my point is.\\nThese phrases should trigger you\\nto pay more attention so you can listen more effectively.\\nAnd of course, always try\\nto let the person who's talking finish\\nrather than interrupting them.\\nThis is not just common courtesy,\\nbut it also ensures that your fully listening to them\\nbefore making points of your own.\\n\\nSo, if you keep these techniques in mind,\\nyou'll become a more active listener,\\nand therefore, a more effective

In this video, we're going to discuss\\nhow you can use the results of brainstorming\\nas an alternative way to efficiently capture notes.\\nBrainstorming can be done individually, or with a group,\\nand it involves an informal approach to solving problems.\\nIt's really a creativity technique that requires\\nyou or a group of people to create\\na list of spontaneous ideas.\\nThere are four major guidelines for effective brainstorming.\\nOne is to withhold judgement of other people's ideas.\\nThis encourages everyone to contribute\\nand think more creatively.\\n\\nBecause the ideas are spontaneous,\\nand sometimes just random,\\nit usually makes brainstorming a pretty fun exercise.\\nThe second major guideline for brainstorming\\nis to focus on quantity.\\nThe more ideas that are generated,\\nthe more likely we'll be able to solve the problems at hand.\\nThe third guideline to effective brainstorming\\nis that strange ideas should be welcomed and encouraged.\\nThese ideas can be created by looking at things\\nfrom a new perspective, or making different assumptions.\\nThe fourth and final guideline is\\nto combine and improve ideas.\\n\\nThis can happen during the brainstorming process,\\nor afterward.\\nIf you're brainstorming with a group,\\nyou need to designate someone as the note-taker.\\nThey need to quickly and efficiently jot down\\nall the ideas as they're being stated.\\nAs we mentioned before, use abbreviations and symbols\\nto speed up this process.\\nYou want to make sure you capture everything.\\nIf you're doing this on your own,\\nyou still want to take notes quickly\\nso you can keep up with your own thoughts.\\nSometimes ideas fly in and out of our head,\\nso we need to capture them the moment they come along.\\n\\nIf you're working with a group to brainstorm,\\nhere's a nice variation that you might find helpful.\\nEveryone in the group sits in a circle,\\nand each person has to write down one idea\\non a sheet of paper.\\nEach person then passes their idea\\nalong to the next person, who elaborates on the idea,\\nadding some more thoughts of their own.\\nThis continues until everyone gets their original idea back.\\nAt this point, the group will have effectively elaborated\\non each and every idea.\\nThose ideas can then be submitted\\nto the group leader for analysis.\\n\\nBrainstorming in this manner is an effective way\\nto harness the collective intelligence of the group.\\nIt's also a great way to generate a lot of ideas\\nin a very short period of time.\\nYou can also brainstorm individually\\nthrough a number of techniques.\\nOne such brainstorming technique is called free writing,\\nwhich involves continuously writing\\nfor a set period of time, without worrying about\\ngrammar, spelling, or even topic.\\nThis technique produces raw content,\\nwhich is often unusable, but it has been shown\\nto help writers overcome self-criticism and writer's block.\\n\\nThe technique can be used to generate initial ideas\\non the topic, and is a very rough draft\\nbefore formal writing.\\nThis is very different from typical brainstorming,\\nin that it doesn't produce a list of ideas,\\nbut instead a stream of thoughts, in paragraph format.\\nThe same brainstorming approach with free writing\\ncan be done with free talking,\\nthe difference being that you just continuously talk,\\nthe downside here being that you aren't\\nwriting anything down, but you can always record yourself\\nif you prefer this method.\\nOne of the most useful brainstorming techniques\\ninvolves the creation of something called a mind map,\\nwhich is a visual note-taking technique\\nthat helps people organize their thoughts.\\n\\nMind maps can be used in a variety of ways,\\nbut they usually consist of a central idea\\nwith surrounding topics and sub-topics.\\nThis mind map is about insurance,\\nand has topics that include property,\\ntravel, liability, life, and health.\\nYou can also see the sub-topics under property\\nthat include vehicle and home.\\nA mind map gives you a nice bird's eye view\\nof the information, so you can see how it's structured.\\nLater in this course, we'll talk about\\nhow to use mind maps for specific situations.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

sentence and realize that's really important\\nso they highlight it.\\nThen they read the next sentence\\nand realize that's also kind of important,\\nand they highlight that as well.\\nThen they read the third sentence,\\nand now they realize this sentence is way more\\nimportant than the previous two, maybe they'll use\\na different color this time around.\\n\\nYou already see where this is going.\\nHave you ever heard the phrase, \\\"When you get caught\\n\\\"up in details, you lose sight of the big picture.\\\"?\\nThis is one of the biggest issues\\nwhen it comes to note-taking.\\nPeople get caught up in details.\\nA better way to handle this would be\\nto finish reading the paragraph and then decide\\nwhat you want to highlight or take notes on.\\nAnd keep in mind, you don't have\\nto write out full sentences.\\nYou could highlight just a word or short phrase, and\\nthat would remind you what the section was about.\\nFor example, when I say the word \\\"Katrina\\\",\\nwhat's the first thing that pops into your mind?\\nFor many people, the word \\\"Katrina\\\"\\nmight remind them of a hurricane.\\n\\nRather than highlighting an entire sentence\\nthat discusses Hurricane Katrina\\nand its effects on the city of New Orleans,\\nyou might instead highlight\\nor take note of the word \\\"Katrina\\\"\\nand that would be enough to remind you of the details.\\nIf you focus on noting just a word or short phrase,\\nyou'll be much more effective with your note-taking.\\nSo again, make sure you finish a paragraph\\nat the very least before taking your notes.\\nIf you still feel like you're spending\\ntoo much time taking notes, you may even want\\nto finish reading a section of text before taking notes.\\n\\nNote-taking is without a doubt helpful,\\nbut if you spend too much time with your notes,\\nit could make you less effective.\\nIf you're wondering how much time should be spent on notes,\\nfollow the 80/20 rule.\\nEighty percent of your time should be spent reading,\\nwhile no more than 20% should be spent taking notes.\\nSo if you're reading for 60 minutes,\\nthis would translate into 12 minutes of notes\\nand 48 minutes of reading.\\nIt doesn't have to be exact, but if you're spending\\nmore than 12 minutes of every hour on notes,\\nyou're probably spending too much time.\\n\\nSo try to follow these

getting you familiar with the material.\\nThis reading strategy is called\\nThe Multiple Reading Process.\\nThe first step in the process is called the Preview.\\nDuring the step, you simply read the introduction\\nand conclusion to the information you're reading.\\nIf you're reading a short article,\\nthis could simply be the first and last paragraph.\\nIf you're reading something longer\\nlike a book chapter or a detailed blog post,\\nthis could be a few paragraphs at the beginning,\\nand a few at the end.\\n\\nKeep in mind that the introduction and conclusion\\nmight be labeled as objectives

have tons\\nof things to write down.\\nYou've only read the introduction and conclusion,\\nso your notes should initially be pretty basic.\\n\\nNow we move on to step number two in the process.\\nThe Overview.\\nIn this step, you'll want to read the headings,\\nsubheadings, and bold-faced words.\\nOr if you don't have headings,\\njust read the first sentence of each paragraph\\nsince first sentences tend to be main ideas.\\nOnce you're done with this,\\ntake some more notes.\\nAt this point, you'll be taking note of the big ideas\\nthat were present in the text.\\nRather than just copying each of the headings,\\nI'd suggest initially writing things down\\non the top of your head.\\nThis is much better for your memory\\nbecause you're forcing yourself\\nto try and recall the information\\nrather than just mindlessly copying headings.\\n\\nOnce you run out of things to write down\\noff the top of your head,\\nthen you'll want to flip through the material\\nto see if there's anything else you'd like\\nto add to your notes.\\nAnd as usual, keep your notes concise.\\nAs soon as you're done with your notes,\\nyou're on step number three,\\nwhich is simply Read.\\nRead the rest of the material.\\nBefore you start reading,\\nthink about how these first two steps have helped.\\nYou've already previewed and overviewed the information.\\nSo you'll know what to expect.\\nYou'll now be able to read the information\\na little more quickly than if you didn't do these steps.\\n\\nAnd you'll also be able to comprehend\\nthe information more easily\\nbecause you'll know what to expect.\\nBut most importantly,\\nyour retention of the material will be better\\nbecause you've had two exposures to the material\\nduring the Preview and Overview,\\nand you've taken notes on both occasions.\\nWhat you remember is largely a function of repetition,\\nand before even reading the material,\\nyou've had four repetitions of the information.\\nOne repetition was from the Preview.\\nRepetition number two was from the Notes\\nbased on that Preview.\\n\\nRepetition number three was based on the Overview.\\nAnd repetition number four\\nwas from the Notes of your Overview.\\nWith this process you should read more confidently.\\nWhy?\\nBecause you'll know what to expect.\\nEven if the information is very technical,\\nyou've made the process easier\\nby getting familiar with the information\\nbefore you start reading the nitty gritty details.\\nAs you read through your text,\\ntake notes here and there\\nas you come across essential information.\\nAs we discussed earlier, make sure you\\naren't notes excessively.\\nAnd be sure to keep your notes concise\\nso you can keep making progress through the material.\\n\\nIf you approach the material in this

easier to remember\\nwhat you're reading, because you'll be\\nin the habit of constantly thinking, \\\"What did I just read?\\\"\\nPart of the reason why we forget information is\\nbecause sometimes we weren't paying attention to begin with.\\nThe Read and Recall Method helps you pay attention\\nbecause if forces you to take notes after every paragraph.\\nIf I know I need to write something down,\\nthen I'm more likely to pay attention while I'm reading.\\nIt's a simple but effective exercise\\nfor improving your retention.\\nAnd here's a little variation of this method\\nthat you can apply to courses here on lynda.com.\\n\\nInstead of the Read and Recall Method,\\nlet's call it the Watch and Recall Method.\\nYou may have noticed the My Notes tab\\nwithin lynda.com courses.\\nHere you can add notes for any video that you watch.\\nThe nice thing about this feature is that it will keep track\\nof the time when you take your notes.\\nSo all of the notes during the video will be associated\\nto a specific place where you added them.\\nAt the end of chapters, or when the course is over,\\nI recommend that you review the\\nnotes that you previously made.\\nSo whether it's the Read and Recall Method,\\nor the Watch and Recall Method, keep in mind that\\ntaking notes will help you better remember the material.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:459926\",\"duration\":52,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge: Read and

just pressing the Delete key\\non my keyboard to do this.\\n\\nSometimes, the things we need to do\\nare related to various parts of our life.\\nFor example, you might have tasks\\nthat you need to get done at work.\\nOther tasks that need to get done at home.\\nAnd, if you're a student, you may\\nhave tasks related to school.\\nSo notice how you can easily add\\nthese general areas and their related tasks.\\nThis gives you almost a bird's eye view of things\\nthat need to get done in your life.\\nThere are a variety of icon markers\\nthat you can add to each task.\\nYou can find these markers in the insert menu,\\nor by simply clicking the red icon\\nthat looks like a flag, in the program's tray.\\n\\nYou'll see that this allows you\\nto add a variety of markers to any of the tasks.\\nFor example, you might want to assign\\na task priority, task progress, flags,\\nstars, arrows, among many other things.\\nOr if there is a specific due date associated with the task,\\nyou can use the month or the day of the week icon.\\nAnd if you're using these icons a lot,\\nyou may want to click on the \\\"More...\\\" menu\\nand that will add it to the side of your
