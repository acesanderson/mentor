[Instructor] Let's take a moment\\nto talk about the relationship\\nbetween Adobe Firefly and Adobe Creative Cloud.\\nNow, first off, it's important to understand\\nthat Adobe Firefly is a web service, which means\\nthat it lives online and you can use a web browser\\nto open up the Adobe Firefly webpage, which is something\\nthat you'll learn in just a couple of videos.\\nNow, you can also use the majority of the Firefly technology\\ndirectly from within that same web browser.\\nNow, Firefly also fuels existing services and features\\nwithin existing Adobe Creative Cloud products.\\n\\nSo this includes Adobe Express,\\nwhere you can use text effects, just to name one example,\\nor maybe Adobe Stock, where you can use\\nthe text-to-image functionality.\\nAnd then there are desktop applications.\\nSo in this case, you are using Photoshop,\\nor maybe you're using Illustrator,\\nto use a very specific Firefly feature\\nlike generative Recaller or generative Expand.\\nAnd those features are going to talk\\nto the Adobe Firefly web service online\\nto get you to the result that you're looking for.\\n\\nSo you do need to have an active internet connection\\neven while you're working on your desktop.\\nNow, Adobe has also recently started to show off\\nthe first automation features and techniques\\nfor generating assets in bulk,\\nthanks to Adobe Firefly, APIs and other services.\\nAnd then there's Adobe Experience Cloud, where we can\\nopen up the journey of AI technology to online marketers.\\nBut at the time of this recording, the most common use cases\\nfor using Firefly are the following,\\nIdeation, where you have the ability to maybe create\\nfive ideas in the same time where you would normally\\nonly create two or maybe get a different perspective\\non a project where Firefly might create an idea\\nthat you never really thought of before.\\n\\nAsset creation, simply creating the asset you're looking for\\nby just typing in a prompt\\nand then having that image magically appear in front of you.\\nAnd then there's implementation.\\nThis is something where you can use Firefly\\nto simply implement requested changes by your customer\\nand then quickly help to update specific projects,\\nfor example, just changing a background.\\nAnd then there's retouching.\\nNow you can use Firefly, for example, in Photoshop\\nor Illustrator as part of your regular toolbox.\\n\\nSo maybe you want to remove an item from a picture\\nand then Content-Aware Fill\\nis just simply not cutting it for you.\\nNow you can try Firefly\\nand see if it does a better service for you.\\nOr how about recoloring a set of icons?\\nYou could potentially use something like generative Recaller\\nin Illustrator to dynamically recall the whole set,\\nbased on the feedback that you got from a customer.\\nBut Firefly truly gives you value as well.\\nNow, let's take a look at a very simple example\\nof how this can boost your productivity.\\n\\nSo here in this example, I have a simple image of a pool.\\nAnd let's imagine that your customer says\\nthat you have to get rid of these deck chairs here.\\nNow this would be a very difficult task for you to perform\\nas the Content-Aware Fill functionality,\\ninstead of Photoshop, or even the Clone Stamp Tool,\\nfor that matter, always relies on the information\\nthat is already available within the image.\\nThe only problem in this example is that there is\\nhardly any source material for you to work with.\\n\\nSo the only thing we have left to do\\nis just to make a selection around the chairs,\\nhit that one magical Firefly button,\\nand then watch those chairs disappear.\\nAnd then it's just a matter of maybe adding\\na couple of different prompts.\\nFor example, a noodle, a floaty, and a beach ball,\\njust to kind of add to the image,\\nand then create something that was virtually impossible\\nto do before using traditional tools in Photoshop.\\nAnd if you're wondering how fast this actually goes,\\nlet's take a look at this here.\\nSo I made a comparison\\nbetween doing this the traditional way\\nand then doing this the Firefly way.\\n\\nNow, traditionally I needed about 30 minutes\\nfor cloning and filling in backgrounds.\\nI got to say I had pretty bad results\\nbecause I hardly had any source material\\nto work with in this image.\\nSecondly, I needed about 25 minutes\\nfor searching the correct stock assets\\nfor everything that's floating in the pool.\\nTheir perspective has to match,\\nthe lighting has to match somewhat, and I just basically\\nhave to try and find the image I'm looking for.\\nAnd then I got about 10 minutes\\nfor extracting and selecting these assets\\nand then another 30 minutes for all the special effects,\\nretouching, changing their perspective, adding shadows,\\nreflections, highlights.\\n\\nThis was a ton of work\\nand I had a very, very bad result, let me tell you.\\nAnd then I used Firefly to do the exact same thing.\\nAnd the only thing I needed was a single minute\\nto select the chairs and then press the Generate button\\nand then simply wait for 20 seconds or so.\\nSecondly, I spent about two minutes to prompt a beach ball,\\nsix minutes to prompt a flamingo.\\nI was very specific on the flamingo I wanted,\\nand I just couldn't, I couldn't find the right flamingo.\\n\\nSo I had to go through a few iterations\\nto find the exact flamingo I was looking for.\\nFlamingos are important.\\nAnd then lastly, I needed just a simple minute\\nto prompt that pool noodle in the background.\\nAnd that was my final result.\\nAnd having this quality this fast\\nin merely 10 minutes was virtually impossible before.\\nNow you can do a lot more\\nthan simply just retouching images.\\nSo you can, for example, also use Firefly for things\\nlike creating storyboards, where you simply describe\\nthe scene that you want and simply adding the fact\\nthat this should be part of a storyboard,\\nwhich is going to give you a sketch effect.\\n\\nNow, this is great for initial ideation\\nand then basically just boosting your productivity.\\nOr what if you're a UX designer\\nand you have to come up with a set of virtual icons\\nor a type of interface for a phone or a computer.\\nNow you can use these exact prompts within Firefly as well.\\nAnd then lastly, there's a a photo shoot\\nand other types of product photography,\\nwhere you can use these dummy objects\\nthat you simply generate using Firefly\\nto put these into a different scene,\\nso you can create any object that you want\\nor any product that you want.\\n\\nAnd then you can put this in any background or any scene\\njust to get that first impression off your customer\\nway before you even want to organize that actual photo shoot\\nor having to invest money, time, or other resources.\\nAnd these are just a couple of examples\\nof what is you can achieve by using Adobe Firefly.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5940031\",\"duration\":266,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"How does Firefly differ from other generative

[Instructor] Let's take a moment to talk\\nabout what makes Adobe Firefly unique.\\nNow, first of all, Firefly is integrated\\nwithin your existing Creative Cloud applications,\\nso you can use your familiar user interface, like Photoshop\\nand Illustrator, to use specific Firefly functionalities\\nwithout having to leave the application,\\nwhich can be a massive production booster.\\nThe second reason why it's unique\\nis because of how Firefly was created.\\nAdobe put out a very bold statement,\\nsaying that Firefly is designed to be commercially safe.\\n\\nSo this means that if you're looking to use Firefly\\nto generate an image, then you can just go ahead and do so\\nand use that image commercially.\\nAnd the reason why is because of the database,\\nthe algorithm that's fueling the Adobe Firefly experience\\nbecause it's based on three things.\\nThe first one is the Adobe Stock database.\\nSo this is Adobe's own stock service\\nthat feeds about 400 million images to Adobe Firefly\\nto help train and maintain the algorithm.\\n\\nAnd these images have already been curated\\nwhen they were initially submitted\\nto the Adobe Stock Service.\\nSecondly, images available within the public space\\non the internet are also used for training.\\nSo these are images\\nwhere there's no copyright in the first place.\\nAnd then thirdly, images of which the copyright has expired,\\nand this gives you a very, very decent database to work with\\nto create images that are free from royalties\\nand free from copyright.\\nNow, there's also a whole conversation\\nabout the relationship\\nbetween using generative AI technology,\\nand then harm and bias towards ethnic groups\\nand other genders, so let me give you an example.\\n\\nIf you're looking to create an image of a nurse\\ntending to a patient, will that nurse always be a woman?\\nOr how about you wanting to create an image\\nthat involves religion?\\nWhich religion will be picked by Firefly?\\nAnd there's just a whole variety of conversations\\nthat you can have around this,\\nbut Adobe has trained Firefly in such a way that there is,\\nwell, there should be more than enough diversity\\nif you're looking at the results of specific images.\\nSo let's take a look at just a couple of examples here\\nof how Firefly is helping you\\nkeep these images commercially safe.\\n\\nNow, the first one, I typed in the prompt,\\n\\\"Superman flying through the sky\\nwith a city in the background.\\\"\\nAnd then, obviously, I'm referring to the Superman.\\nHowever, the result I'm getting is this,\\nand I have to say, initially, this result got flagged\\nby the Adobe Firefly Services\\nbecause I was using the term Superman,\\nwhich is a copyrighted character,\\nand Firefly was blocking me\\nfrom trying to create Superman images,\\nso I had to rephrase this a little bit,\\nand I basically said I want to have a superhero\\nflying through the sky,\\nand obviously, because it's a little bit cliche,\\nthe superhero was automatically getting a red cape.\\n\\nLet's look at a second example,\\nHere, I typed in, \\\"A Van Gogh style painting\\nfeaturing beautiful, green fields, cows, and the blue sky.\\\"\\nSo the prompt concept remains,\\nif you look at the results here,\\nbut there are no real references to real artists\\nor the visual style inside of Adobe Firefly.\\nNow, you do have ways\\nof bringing your own visual style references if you want,\\nand you'll learn all about that later in this course,\\nbut just know that we're not specifically looking at images\\nthat are exact copies of a Van Gogh style,\\nor any other famous painter for that matter.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, I tried this one,\\n\\\"Disney's Mickey Mouse performing a magic spell.\\\"\\nThis also got flagged and I wasn't even able to create\\nor use any of the Disney character names\\nbecause this is intellectual property,\\nso Firefly is shielding me\\nfrom using those specific characters.\\nInstead, I had to reside to using a simple mouse\\nperforming a magic spell,\\nso I have to change how I prompt things,\\nand it's important that you realize\\nhow Firefly is basically trained and maintained\\njust to match expectations about what is that you want to do\\nand what is that you want to create.\\n\\nSo if you want to create celebrities in various poses\\nor in fancy, fast cars and other types of scenes,\\nthen Firefly is probably not the solution for you,\\nbecause it's really difficult to depict real people\\nand real intellectual property products and characters.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2722033\",\"duration\":128,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Is Firefly

[Instructor] Is Adobe Firefly free?\\nWell, the short answer is yes,\\nbut there are some things you do need to know.\\nAdobe Firefly uses its own currency system\\ncalled generative credits, or,

using the Generative Fill option\\nin Photoshop,\\nor how about text effects in Adobe Express,\\nor how about when you're recoloring\\nor creating vector artwork using Adobe Illustrator?\\nNow, this all sounds fine,\\nbut how many credits do you have available?\\nBecause every single time you use any of these prompts,\\nthis will consume one credit.\\n\\nWell, that depends on whether you are\\na paying subscriber or not.\\nIf you use a free Firefly account,\\nwhich you can register directly on the Firefly webpage,\\nyou will have a total\\nof 25 credits available to you per month,\\nwhere unused credits will not transfer into the next month.\\nBut if you have some type of an Adobe subscription,\\nfor example, an Adobe Creative Cloud membership\\nor even a single app membership,\\nlet's

[Instructor] Now let's start by adding\\nsomething that's very simple.\\nSo, make sure you are clicking inside\\nof the prompt command box\\nand let's type in something to start with.\\nI'm going to type in a dog reading a book,\\nI'll hit Enter or Return to confirm,\\nand while the results are loading,\\nlet me tell you now that we're getting four results\\nand not just one single result.\\nAnd that is just Firefly's default behavior.\\nWith every prompt that you type in,\\nyou're getting four results for the price of one.\\nNow you might remember the generative credit system\\nI explained to you before.\\n\\nWell, this is only consuming a single credit,\\nand while you're still getting four results,\\nwhich I think is a pretty good deal.\\nNow, let's take a look at some of the results here.\\nThere's a couple things I do want to point out.\\nFirst of all, I'm getting four square results\\nand the reason this is happening\\nis because here on the left-hand side,\\nby default, the aspect ratio is set to square.\\nNow, you have more options available here\\nand we'll change that in just a few minutes.\\nNow if you look at these results you have here,\\nyou can actually click the one you like best.\\n\\nLet's click the first one here on the top left,\\nand then you can see a larger version of that result.\\nYou can even use the left or right pointing arrows\\nto go through the other results,\\nor press the left or right arrows on the keyboard\\nto navigate through these different results I have here.\\nNow, keep in mind that you will see different results\\nthan what I see on my screen,\\nand that's because with every prompt that you type in,\\nthere's a certain randomness factor\\nthat's being added to the prompt itself,\\nwhich means that you can not\\nreally create the same image twice.\\n\\nWell, in theory it's possible,\\nbut you're just as lucky\\nto win the lottery while getting eaten by a shark probably.\\nBut, anyway, keep in mind that you have a unique result,\\nwhich means that if you are fearful of losing that result\\nfor whatever reason, for example, you close your browser,\\nyou can always just hover over any of these results here\\nand then choose to click the star icon\\nto add that to your personal gallery of favorite images.\\nOr you can down the image by clicking the download option,\\nor you can click the export option here to copy the link\\nto save that as a backup, or share this with other people,\\nor copy the image into Photoshop,\\nsave it to a library to bring it\\ninto the Adobe Creative Cloud ecosystem.\\n\\nYou have a lot of different options.\\nThe left-hand side, you can even choose\\nto take this image deeper into Adobe Firefly\\nby choosing any of these options,\\nor take this image out of Firefly\\nand into Adobe Express by adding text, shapes\\nand converting this to a social media post.\\nNow, you can also give Adobe feedback\\naround the results that you see on screen.\\nIf you like the results,\\nyou can give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down,\\nor you can click the report option\\nif you do think that this might be harmful\\nor offensive content to you,\\nadd a note to help Adobe understand\\nwhat is wrong with the result,\\nand then click the Submit Report option\\nto help fine-tune the Adobe Firefly algorithm.\\n\\nI'll choose Cancel for now,\\nand I'm going to go ahead and just click\\nthe Close button here to go back to the Main options.\\nLet's make a few changes.\\nFirst of all, I want to change the aspect ratio.\\nTo do this, simply click the Square option\\nwe have here under Aspect Ratio,\\nand then switch this to something that you want to change,\\nfor example, Landscape.\\nAnd notice that absolutely nothing happens.\\nSo, how this works is the following,\\nyou go in and you change your settings\\non the left-hand side, for example,\\nyou can change the Aspect Ratio,\\nor any of these other options you have available\\non the left-hand side.\\n\\nAnd then you simply go back\\nand click the Generate option again\\nto have Firefly reinterpret the prompt,\\ntogether with your updated settings.\\nIn this case, I want to create landscape images.\\nNow this also means\\nbecause of that randomness factor,\\nthat I'm getting different results than what I had before.\\nSo it's not really expanding the existing images,\\nit is just merely trying\\nto give you a new version of the prompt,\\nbut in a landscape orientation.\\nLet's make a few changes to the prompt itself.\\n\\nA dog reading a book is a bit, you know, it's a bit generic,\\nso there's a lot of room for interpretation.\\nI seem to be getting a lot of Christmas-themed images\\nfor whatever reason,\\nand I have another versions here where the dog is not,\\nyou know, at a table,\\nbut it's mainly sitting on the floor, I guess.\\nLet's change a couple things.\\nFor example, let's update the prompt to the following,\\na dog reading a book\\nwhile sitting\\nat a desk by,\\nlet's try this,\\ncomma space,\\nwhile wearing glasses\\ncomma space with a library of books\\nvisible in the background.\\n\\nNow let's hits Enter or Return to confirm,\\nand let's see what we get as a result.\\nNow, what I've done is I have been very specific\\nwith Firefly,\\nand that's exactly how you start\\nto build a really good prompt.\\nSo, what I've now described is I have a subject,\\nwhich is a dog, I have an activity, he's reading a book,\\nI have a location, he's sitting on a desk,\\nand I have circumstances because it is by candlelight\\nand he's wearing glasses.\\nAnd then something that a lot of people seem\\nto forget about, it's the background.\\n\\nWhere is this happening?\\nWell, it's happening in a location\\nwhere there is a library of books visible in the background.\\nNow, I can add additional elements to this prompt.\\nFor example, I can say that this should be a a closeup shot,\\nor this should be shot from above,\\nor this should be a wide-angle shot.\\nOr I can add different other themes to the prompt itself.\\nOr you can even add different things, for example,\\nyou can say that something is exciting\\nor cozy or mysterious.\\n\\nAnd so you can add these different aspects to your prompt\\nwhere you're not really explaining what that is,\\nlike, what does mysterious look like?\\nSo you're giving Firefly room for interpretation,\\nand that's where things get really, really interesting.\\nBut for now, I got to say, I end up here\\nwith four very, very smart dogs.\\nI mean, look at these guys.\\nSo, these guys have been studying all night by candlelight.\\nThey have to go through all these books here,\\nI really feel for them,\\nbut I really have the image I'm looking for.\\n\\nAnd you can always go back\\nand help refine that prompt specifically.\\nSo you can kind of call going back to the prompt,\\nsomething like prompt sculpting or something.\\nIt's like, you know, while you're acting like a

[Instructor] Adobe Firefly is driven\\nby a large data model, and that algorithm is giving you\\nthe results that you currently see onscreen.\\nSo this really big algorithm is driving a lot\\nof the functionality,\\nnot just here within the Adobe Firefly web page\\nwhere we're currently using the Text to Image functionality,\\nbut also when you launch Photoshop\\nand you're using additional functionalities,\\nlike Generative Fill or Generative Expand,\\nor in Illustrator when you're using Text to Vector,\\nor Adobe Express or any other application\\nthat's fueled by Adobe Firefly.\\n\\nSo what Adobe's doing is,\\nit is regularly fine-tuning and updating\\nthat specific algorithm to make it smarter\\nand to make sure that you are getting far better results\\nthan what you were able to do before.\\nAnd this results not just in having a better quality,\\nas in a visual quality image or an image result,\\nwhich might result in larger resolution,\\nas in more pixels, or an image that's clearer or sharper\\nor that looks less AI-generated or less CG-generated,\\nfor example, but this also allows you\\nto interpret the prompts in a different way.\\n\\nWhich means that Firefly is going to get smarter,\\nand it's going to get a lot better at interpreting the prompt\\nand interpreting the words that you type in here\\ninto this text box.\\nNow, if you look at the model options on the left here\\nof my screen, you can see\\nthat there's a Firefly Image 3 model,\\nand there is a Firefly Image 2 model.\\nAnd this is what I currently see at the time\\nof this recording.\\nSo at the time of this recording, for me,\\nAdobe has just released Firefly Image 3\\nas a preview version, and this is the version that comes\\nafter Firefly Image 2, which is released roughly\\nin the month of October in the year 2023.\\n\\nSo which means that, as you're using Firefly Image 3,\\nwhich is the default today,\\nyou will get very specific results.\\nBut that does not take away that, maybe,\\nin some circumstances, if you go to Firefly Image 2\\nand you switch models,\\nyou will get a different result of the same image.\\nIt's using an older version of the algorithm,\\nbut old doesn't quite mean obsolete all the time.\\nSo if you click Firefly Image 2 instead,\\nyou can even see that I now have photo settings available,\\nwhich allows me to set specific settings,\\nlike aperture, shutter speed, and field of view,\\nsomething we'll cover in a future video.\\n\\nAnd this is not available if you go back to model three,\\nwhere I'm assuming, the interpretation\\nof specific photo settings is already embedded\\nin your basic prompt functionality.\\nBut if I go back here and if I go back\\nto the Firefly Image 2 and then quickly click\\nthe Generate option, it's going to reinterpret\\nthe exact same prompt I have here in the prompt command box,\\nbut it's going to be using Firefly Image model two\\nto give you the result that you're looking for.\\nSo let's look at the result here.\\n\\nNow, I'm getting a very similar result.\\nIt's taken in the same circumstances of the image.\\nI've got four very smart dogs reading books\\nby candlelight with a library of books in the background.\\nBut I can't help but feel if I go quickly back\\nto the previous version by clicking the back button here,\\nthat I am actually seeing a more photorealistic result\\nusing Image model three.\\nSo depending on what it is you're looking for specifically,\\nfor example, something that has to look photorealistic\\nversus something that might look a bit more CG-generated\\nor that might look a bit more like an art piece,\\nyou might still want to consider going back to version two\\nand look at that different interpretation\\nof the same prompt.\\n\\nI've actually had a few cases where I did notice\\nthat Firefly Image 2 gave me a slightly better result\\ncompared to Firefly Image 3.\\nBut it all depends on the prompt,\\nthe settings you set, and your own expectations.\\nWhat is it that you're visually looking for\\nwhen you are trying to generate these images?\\nSo by default, keep in mind that there is Firefly Image 3,\\nwhich is something that you will always be using\\nthroughout this course, but you also have a way\\nto go back to version two.\\n\\nAnd just be curious and experiment\\nand try and see if you can get a slightly better result\\nusing model two instead of three.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5938043\",\"duration\":278,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Text prompt best

[Narrator] Let's take a look at a few very practical tips\\non how you can get the most out of Adobe Firefly.\\nNow, keep in mind that Adobe Firefly is expecting very clear\\ninstructions from you, and knowing how to talk\\nto Firefly is really going to help you\\nto get the best results out of this amazing system.\\nNow, there are a few guidelines for you to follow.\\nThe first one is that you have to be descriptive.\\nNow, don't give out commands.\\nNow, this is especially true once you start to use Firefly\\ninside of Adobe Photoshop.\\nFor example, I've seen users make selections\\nand then simply add things like remove person,\\nor they would type in add water.\\n\\nSo the general guidance here is\\nthat you don't start your prompt with a verb,\\ndon't give out commands.\\nIt's expecting a description of what it is\\nthat it should be creating for you in your selection\\nor as part of an image.\\nThe second one is that you have to be detailed.\\nYou have to be specific\\nand describe the details exactly as you envision them.\\nSo for example, where is your scene taking place?\\nIs this in a city?\\nIs this outside?\\nIs this in a forest, maybe?\\nWhat is the weather like?\\nWhat is the time of day?\\nWhere is this happening?\\nWhat kind of style are you envisioning, for example,\\nbe specific.\\n\\nAnd when you are specific, you can leave as less room\\nfor interpretation as possible.\\nNow, if you want to add a simple image of a bowl\\nof fruit on the table, what does the table look like?\\nIs it a wooden table?\\nIs it a large table?\\nIs it metallic, round?\\nIs it a coffee table, maybe?\\nAnd what kind of fruit are you looking for?\\nAre you just looking for apples and oranges\\nor would you want this to look a bit more exotic?\\nWhat does the bowl look like?\\nIs it transparent?\\nBe specific and specify what it is that you want.\\n\\nNow, if you allow Firefly to fill in these gaps,\\nthen you will get unexpected results,\\nand then you have to make combinations and make alterations.\\nSo be sure to describe color palettes\\nor what does the background look like?\\nWhat is the visual style you're looking for?\\nWhat is the subject\\nand what kind of style does that subject basically have?\\nNow, all these things are really, really important.\\nSo if you're looking for something\\nthat has a really sharp depth of field,\\nor with the background should be blurry,\\nthen you know you simply go ahead\\nand you specify those details as best as you can.\\n\\nNow let's take a look at a very simple structure.\\nIf you type in something like a knight on a horse,\\nyou are not going to get a lot of really great results\\nbecause it's too generic, it's too short,\\nyou're not specifying the details,\\nand your results might be all over the place.\\nIf you simply type in a knight on a horse,\\nthis is typically what you get.\\nSo the knight is looking pretty good, I have to say,\\nbut I'm getting a variety of different images.\\nThere's a lot going on here.\\nI didn't even specify whether\\nor not I want this to be like a piece of art\\nor a real life looking picture.\\n\\nSo if you don't specify the details,\\nthen you're giving Firefly the freedom\\nto fill in the gaps for you.\\nNow let's take a look at a better version\\nof the same prompt.\\nSo here's a good example.\\nA hyper realistic, detailed image\\nof a knight wearing armor\\nand the blue shield, riding a white horse on a sunny day\\nwith a medieval castle visible in the background,\\nwide shot, fantasy theme.\\nNow, this is more like it because it's very specific.\\n\\nIt is highly detailed.\\nIt describes the surroundings,\\nand it also describes the style, theme,\\nand camera information.\\nSo be sure to try and find all these different ingredients,\\nas I've highlighted them here in color,\\nand make them a part of your prompt.\\nAnd then don't be upset\\nor frustrated when you don't get the\\nresults you're looking for\\nif you decide to leave some of these details out\\nof the prompt itself.\\nAnd if you're wondering what this actually gives us\\nas a result, this was the image I got at the very end.\\n\\nSo I think the main takeaway\\nfor this specific video is be specific, be descriptive,\\nand after a while, you will become a true Firefly whisperer\\nbecause you will learn how to build a prompt\\nand how to sculpt that prompt.\\nThe first line that you type in might be a bit basic,\\nand you get certain results, and then you get to jump in\\nand make alterations.\\nYou will add elements, change elements, or remove elements,\\nand you keep fine-tuning the prompt until you're happy.\\n\\nYou're a bit like a sculptor.\\nYou're sculpting prompts,\\nand you only stop the moment you're happy with the results.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2722032\",\"duration\":407,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using content types and

[Instructor] Let's talk a few minutes\\nto talk about different content types and content styles\\nto help you refine what it is you're looking for.\\nI'm starting here on the Firefly webpage\\nand I'm ready to start typing in my next text prompt.\\nI'm going to type in something that should be pretty fun,\\nwhich is, \\\"A robot dancing at a party.\\\"\\nLet's hit enter or return and see what Firefly gives me.\\nSo let's take a look at\\nthe basic interpretation of this prompt.\\nSo when you type in something in Firefly,\\nyou are giving Firefly the choice\\nhow to interpret this specific image.\\n\\nAnd so looking at this specific image here,\\nI can clearly see that this is not a photograph,\\nthis is digital art.\\nSo what happened now is, let's quickly click close,\\nwhat happened here is that Firefly made the call\\nthat this should probably be an art piece.\\nFirefly thinks or assumes that is the style I'm looking for.\\nNow that's fine, for now.\\nI'm actually quite happy with the result I'm getting.\\nMaybe it's the robot's birthday, who knows?\\nBut I can still come in, I can make these changes.\\n\\nNow, the reason why Firefly is doing this on my behalf\\nis because, by default, this is set to auto,\\nwhich means you make up your mind.\\nNow, if I switch this over from art to photo,\\nthen I can come in here, click the generate option again,\\nand now I'm actually asking Firefly\\nto do something that's a bit more visual,\\nthat's more realistic looking.\\nNow based on the prompt itself, that might be easy,\\nbut that might also be very difficult.\\nNow as you can see here, this is a real party\\nand I have this robot dancing,\\nand I got to say I am getting better results\\nthan I thought I was going to get.\\n\\nSo I have various people having fun,\\nand then clearly, someone brought the robot.\\nNow you can actually go back\\njust by clicking the close button again\\nand help refine the results that you currently have.\\nSo we were looking at images and actual photos\\nwhen the dog was reading a book before,\\nso let's go back and click the art option.\\nI'll just click generate\\njust to go back to the previous results\\nand let's take a look at some of the additional options\\nthat we have available.\\nNow, while this is loading, let me scroll down these options\\nand let's take a look here at two specific things.\\n\\nI want to talk about the visual intensity slider.\\nI want to talk about the effects options.\\nNow, the visual intensity slider\\nliterally does what it says it does.\\nIt's going to change the visual intensity of the image,\\nwhich means that if you move this all the way to the left\\nand then you click the generate option\\nto refresh your prompt, you will get a result,\\na robot dancing at a party that's going to look\\nvery, very basic, not a lot of detail,\\nvery simplistic way of drawing the robot.\\n\\nAnd as you can see here, this is not extremely detailed.\\nNow this, in some occasions, might work really good,\\nespecially if you're trying to create something\\nthat might look like a robot for a children's book,\\ndepending on the combination of filters\\nand other things as well,\\nbecause sometimes if you're looking for something\\nthat should be basic line art,\\nyou might get just too much detail,\\nand that's exactly where and how\\nthe visual intensity slider can come in and help you out.\\nHowever, you can go into the opposite direction as well.\\n\\nLet's drag this all the way to the right.\\nLet's click generate, and now let's take a look and see\\nwhat that's going to look like.\\nSo now I have a robot dancing at a party, again,\\nas an art piece with full visual intensity,\\nwhich means I'm expecting a ton of detail.\\nNow you can see that I am getting a lot of detail,\\nI'm getting a lot more color,\\nand there's just a lot more going on in these images,\\nand that's exactly where and how this slider is being used.\\nI'll just quickly click the close option here,\\nput this back into the midpoint, which is its default value.\\n\\nI'll click generate just to go back to that result as well,\\nand then we can come in here\\nand take a look at the effects options.\\nNow Firefly allows you to choose from a whole variety\\nof visual effects and styles to choose from,\\nwhich means that I can take a look\\nat some of the more popular effects now,\\nlike a bouquet or synth wave effect,\\nor I can click any of these additional subcategories\\nto choose the effect I'm looking for.\\nFor example, if I choose to have a cyberpunk theme,\\nI can click that filter\\nto go ahead and add that filter here\\nas a property combined with my current prompt.\\n\\nI can come in here and click generate\\nto come in and now alter the results I have\\ninside of Adobe Firefly.\\nSo now I'm combining the art and the cyberpunk filters\\nor effects to get to a different result.\\nSo let's see what that does.\\nSo this is now giving me\\nthe cyberpunk version I was looking for.\\nNow you can always go back\\nand you can make additional changes.\\nSo you can actually make a combination of,\\nfor example, cyberpunk and impressionism.\\nSo you can click as many as you like to go absolutely crazy.\\n\\nI just clicked a few random ones and I'm going to go ahead\\nand just click the generate option and see what that does.\\nIt might not break down Firefly,\\nbut I'm guessing it's going to give me\\na pretty weird result if I try and combine\\nall these different things at the same time.\\nIt's a bit like cooking, I guess,\\nwhere you're trying just to combine\\nevery single spice and herb that you have\\njust to give your food a bit of flavor.\\nNow I got to say, it's actually not looking half bad.\\nSo this is what we might call happy accidents\\nwhen you're using Adobe Firefly.\\n\\nLet's go back and hit the close button.\\nNow let's just remove some of these filters here.\\nSo let's just get rid of all of these ones\\nby clicking the X icon,\\nand let's try something that's a bit more simplistic.\\nLet's go back to the popular filter,\\nand let's choose something like layered paper.\\nI'll click generate, and this is going to be my last example.\\nI'm sure you understand how this works now,\\nbut just understand that adding a visual effect\\ncan radically change how you see the image result.\\n\\nAnd this, especially if you look at these examples here,\\nlike this looks absolutely great.\\nTurning this into a text prompt and describing this image\\nusing words would probably take you two, three paragraphs\\njust to nail all the details.\\nWhile here in this example,\\nI simply wrote, \\\"A robot dancing at a party,\\\"\\nand I had one simple filter,\\nand I think that's also part of the power of Firefly,\\nand that is that it's really a tool built for designers,\\npeople who want to visualize specific graphics,\\nand because of that, everything,\\nthe entire interface is very, very visual\\nand you have a ton of freedom to experiment and try it,\\nwhatever it is that you want to try out,\\nand hopefully you'll get to see a lot more happy accidents.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2723033\",\"duration\":386,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Finding similar images and saving

[Instructor] Let's take a few minutes\\nto talk about reusing a generated image you really like,\\nhow to save it for later,\\nor how to generate more content that looks just like it.\\nSo I would like to show you two separate cases\\nwhere I think one specific option\\nis really going to make your day.\\nThis is the first one.\\nSo I started out here in Adobe Firefly\\nwhere I type in the prompt, a pink neon sign\\non top of a colorful shop, spelling out the word candy.\\nAnd this is exactly what I'm getting.\\nSo I'm getting a neon sign,\\nit is all the pink in there,\\nand it is spelling out the word candy.\\n\\nNow if you click on the result\\nand notice that this is something that you might want to save\\nfor later, you have two options.\\nNow, you can either just go ahead here\\nand you can click the download option\\njust to have a local copy saved to your hard drive,\\nbut when you close your web browser,\\nthere's actually no way to go back to this specific result.\\nAnd if you were to retype the same prompt,\\nyou would get a similar looking result,\\nbut not quite the exact same thing.\\nSo what do you do?\\nHow do you save these results separately\\nwithin the Adobe Firefly ecosystem?\\nWell, this is where favorites come in.\\n\\nSo when you found an image that you really like\\nand you feel like reusing the same prompt\\nor feel like revisiting the result\\nthat you have on the screen,\\nsimply click the star icon here\\nto save that to your favorites.\\nNow it says saved too favorites\\nand it's allowing me to view the favorites from here.\\nNow, the message has now disappeared as I was speaking,\\nso I'm not quite sure where to go.\\nNow, let me show you where you can find the favorites.\\nClick the close option and go into the main Firefly webpage.\\n\\nI'll just go ahead and just click this option here\\nto go back to the main landing page,\\nand then notice there's a favorites option\\nat the top of the screen, so choose favorites,\\nand here you can actually find\\nthe same prompt you had before.\\nNow, as you can see, it says a pink neon sign\\non top of a colorful shop, spelling out the word candy.\\nNow from here, I can go ahead\\nand redownload that exact same image,\\nor I can choose the view samples option,\\nwhich is going to allow me to, first of all,\\nreuse the exact same result.\\n\\nIt's going to reuse the exact same prompt\\nand any type of setting I've used before,\\nand it is going to reload new results here\\nfor the three other options.\\nSo be sure to use the favorites option.\\nI use that option quite a lot, to be honest,\\nbecause it allows me to be creative,\\nsave a couple of favorites,\\nand then try and revisit those images\\nand see if I can kind of reuse some of the results\\nI had before.\\nNow, there's another thing you can actually use\\nto help fine tune the results that you have,\\nand I'm going to start it with this specific example.\\n\\nSo here, I've gone ahead and I've created this prompt.\\nSo looking at the options,\\nI have chosen a widescreen aspect ratio\\nand I've also chosen the art content type.\\nOn top of that, I looked into the effects panel we have here\\nand I selected bioluminescent\\nand also the underwater theme.\\nNow you can actually find all these options\\nif you go ahead and click the effects option\\njust to filter on these specific effects.\\nOn top of that, I used the following prompt,\\na detailed underwater city\\nwith mechanical fish swimming in the background.\\n\\nNow, the goal of this specific prompt\\nis to find some sort of a concept art for a next project.\\nAnd as you can see, I have four similar looking results here\\nthat's actually taking into account the underwater\\nand bioluminescent filters,\\nwhich is why I'm having this blue green theme going on\\nfor all four results.\\nHowever, if you look closely at the details,\\nyou can see that these images are quite different.\\nThis image features these two very large mechanical fish,\\nwhich tend to, I think they're actually the city itself.\\n\\nI'm not quite sure.\\nHere, I'm focusing on one big city\\nwith fish swimming overhead,\\nand I've got a similar looking image here\\non the right hand side with, again, one central building\\nwith more fish swimming overhead.\\nIf you look at the one here on the left side,\\nthis is actually quite interesting.\\nSo here I have, I'm assuming these are people\\nor divers, I'm not quite sure,\\nand I have these really big fish swimming through the city,\\nand this camera shot is very, very different.\\nHere, I seem to be inside of the city already.\\n\\nI kind of like this.\\nNow let's choose to close options\\nso I can see all results together.\\nAnd now let's try and create similar looking results\\nbased on that last specific version.\\nSo I'm going to come in here, hover my cursor on top\\nof this result, click the edit option,\\nand I'll choose generate similar.\\nI do that, and notice that all three results here\\nare basically going to now generate different results\\nbased on the input I had here.\\n\\nNow, when you choose generate similar,\\nit doesn't quite mean rebuild the exact same composition,\\nbut it is going to look, well, similar.\\nNow as you can see, the shot is kind of the same.\\nI also seem to feature these humanoid figures\\nor divers here in the actual scenes.\\nThe camera seems to be located in the city itself as well,\\nand I have these other fish swimming through the scene,\\nand this is very similar to what I had here on this side.\\nOn top of that, I also have the same type of lighting\\ninside of these buildings with a nice yellow glow,\\nand I just seem to have this overall sense of perspective.\\n\\nAlso, notice that the stairs I have here\\nhave also been replicated in all four versions\\nof this iteration, and you can now basically choose\\nthe version you like best and just go deeper and deeper.\\nFor example, if you like this specific version\\nwith all these different pillars,\\nyou might want to go back into the edit menu\\nand then choose generate similar once more\\nto now refresh these three images\\nbased on the result you had here.\\nAnd you can keep fine tuning your results as you see fit,\\nand you can even start to add more effects to your result\\nto get to a different type of image.\\n\\nNow, here I can see that I have a different result\\nwhere I am, again, replicating the same perspective\\nwith these different pillars, the stairs, a humanoid,\\nand the fish going through the city.\\nSo next time you're trying to create\\nsomething similar looking based on a prompt,\\nremember to click this option here in the edit menu\\nand then choose generate similar.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5940030\",\"duration\":265,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Sharing prompts with

music)\\n- [Narrator] It is time for a challenge\\nand for this challenge, let's imagine we were designing\\nan ad for a brand of coloring pencils.\\nWhat you see on screen now is the first version of this ad,\\nand we're going to do this inside of Adobe Photoshop.\\nSo here in Photoshop, I have pencils.psd open,\\nand this design consists of three layers.\\nI have a pencils layer, I have a text layer,\\nand then there is a background layer.\\n\\nSo the idea is quite simple.\\nWe're going to generate an image using Firefly,\\nand I would like you to paste that image here\\ninside of this specific ad.\\nI'll give you details in just a few seconds here.\\nSo what we want to do is the following,\\nthis customer wants to show off what amazing things\\nyou can draw or color using their pencils.\\nWe're currently in the ideation phase,\\nand we're about to propose a campaign image\\nto this customer.\\nNow, the idea that I have is to create a detailed\\npencil drawing of a lion laying down in a field,\\nlet's say somewhere in Africa maybe.\\n\\nBut since these are all coloring pencils,\\nit's really important that we add as much color\\nas we can to this drawing.\\nSo maybe the lion is laying in the field during sunset.\\nNow also take into consideration that this illustration\\nneeds to look like an actual pencil drawing,\\nso it cannot really be a real photograph.\\nSo the image I want you to create using Adobe Firefly\\nis a pencil sketch of a lion laying down in a field,\\nand it needs to have dramatic colors.\\n\\nSo my recommendation is that you take a look at the prompt\\nthat you would like to use, and also pay attention at the\\navailable styles or other options that you might be able\\nto apply to this very specific prompt.\\nAlso, take into consideration that this is\\na portrait oriented design, so you might want to change\\nthe aspect ratio when you're using your prompt.\\nNow, when you're done, simply open up this image in Firefly,\\nclick the Export option and copy the image to the clipboard,\\nafter which you go back to Photoshop\\nand you paste in that design here in this Photoshop design.\\n\\nAnd whatever you do, just make sure that the pasted image\\nsits just above the background layer,\\nwhich means that the text and this pencil's layer\\nwill sit on top of that pasted image\\nhere in the layer stack.\\nGood luck.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2722031\",\"duration\":195,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Solution: Pencil

upbeat music)\\n- [Instructor] Let's take a look\\nat the solution to this challenge.\\nWell, when I say solution, I mean my interpretation\\nof the solution,\\nbecause every result in Firefly is going to\\nlook a little bit different.\\nNow let me show you the options I used to get\\nto this specific result.\\nFirst, I came into the aspect ratio options,\\nand I changed this from square to portrait.\\nThen I typed in the folding prompt,\\na colorful pencil drawing of a lion laying in a field\\nduring sunset.\\n\\nNow, I had to make sure I click the art option here\\nbecause in my case, Firefly, I was interpreting my prompt\\nas a photo and I was not looking for a picture of a lion\\nI wanted a pencil drawing of a lion.\\nNow, I wasn't quite getting the results I was looking for,\\nso I had to go a little bit deeper.\\nSo what I did was I scrolled down these options\\nuntil I saw the effects and I added two specific effects.\\nI add the painting effect\\nand I also add the line drawing effect.\\n\\nNow, if I only use the painting effect,\\nthen this result actually looked like a true painting,\\nbut I'm looking for a line drawing\\nor at least a pencil sketch.\\nSo by adding the second effect on top\\nof the painting effect, I got something\\nthat I was actually quite happy with, which means an image\\nthat looks like it's sketched, there's a bit\\nof watercolor everywhere,\\nbut because of the line drawing effect on top of it,\\nit actually looks more like a potential pencil drawing.\\n\\nNow, how do you get this result from Firefly into Photoshop?\\nIt's actually quite simple.\\nYou click this option here to access the expert options,\\nand then you choose copy image.\\nOnce the image has been copied to the clipboard,\\nsimply return the Photoshop, choose edit,\\nand then choose paste to paste the result.\\nNow, this layer came in here on the exact correct location\\nwhere I envisioned it to be.\\nIf this is not the case for you, simply click\\nand drag the layer in the layer stack\\nuntil it reaches the top on top\\nor above the background layer.\\n\\nIt's also not really fitting the entire screen.\\nSo let's scale this up a little bit.\\nI'll press and hold down the command T shortcut\\non the keyboard, which is Ctrl+T on Windows.\\nAnd I'll just go ahead and just drag these corners outward\\nwithout holding down the shift key.\\nIt should scale proportionally by default.\\nAnd I'll just quickly reposition this just a little bit,\\nand when I'm done, I'll just hit enter or return to confirm.\\nNow, the last thing that I have to do is I have\\nto blend this image into the background.\\n\\nNow, you might not see this,\\nbut there's actually a bit\\nof paper texture in the original background itself,\\nand the pencils also have a drop shadow applied to them.\\nSo to blend this image into the background,\\nI'm going to come in here\\nand make sure that layer one,\\nas the pasted image is currently highlighted\\nin the layers panel, and I'll switch to normal blending mode\\nto multiply to actually have a finished version\\nof the effect I'm looking for.\\nAnd now this is the final version I can share\\nwith my customer.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

[Instructor] Let's look at a few more ways\\nhow you can express yourself more creatively.\\nIn the previous videos, you learned how to change\\nan image's aspect ratio, how to choose the appropriate\\ncontent type and how to choose from a variety\\nof different effects.\\nNow, these combined settings really allow you\\nto support your text prompt\\nfrom a creative and more expressive way.\\nBut in my experience, there are a few more options\\nthat tend to have an even bigger impact,\\nsettings which have a heavy visual impact on your results,\\nbut which can be difficult to express in words.\\n\\nLet me show you what I'm talking about.\\nHere inside of Adobe Firefly, I started out\\nwith this very specific prompt,\\na butterfly resting on a flower.\\nNow, notice that I didn't really specify\\nwhat the background should look like,\\nnor did I specify what type of flower\\nor what type of butterfly I would like to see.\\nI will leave that up to Firefly.\\nNow, if I look at my options here on the left-hand side,\\nI am already seeing a couple of familiar things.\\nSo I'm using a square aspect ratio.\\nI'm not really using any of these different effects,\\nbut at the very bottom here of these options,\\nI do have three more settings\\nthat I have not yet introduced:\\ncolor and tone, lighting and camera angle.\\n\\nSo setting these three settings really allow you to give\\nthat extra punch to your images.\\nLet me show you a couple of examples.\\nSo I'm not going to touch the color and tone,\\nnor the lighting settings.\\nSo let's start out by playing with the camera angle\\njust to get started.\\nI'll change this option from none\\nto something very, very different.\\nLet's choose, for example, shot from above.\\nAnd this is going to add the camera angle setting here\\nas part of my prompt.\\nI'll just go ahead and choose generate\\nto refresh the results.\\n\\nAnd here you have it.\\nI have a very, very different looking image now.\\nNow, I didn't specify the exact butterfly I was looking for,\\nwhich means that Firefly took the liberty\\nof also changing the type of butterfly\\nand flower that I'm currently looking at,\\nand that's absolutely fine for this exercise.\\nThe most important thing for me now\\nis the fact that I am clearly looking at this\\nshot from above.\\nSo this means that now I have a very different perspective\\nlooking at this image.\\nLet's keep going.\\nWhat if I change the color and tones?\\nSo for example, if I take a look at this one,\\nfor example, muted color,\\nit will add the muted color setting here\\ninto the prompt command box.\\n\\nI'll just click generate to update the prompt.\\nAnd now again, I have a very different image.\\nNow, this one is clearly no longer shot from above,\\nbut that's absolutely fine.\\nThree out of four is good enough for me.\\nSo if I take a look at the result now,\\nagain, I have a better image than I had before.\\nThese images look a lot more artistic\\nwith the muted color effect being applied.\\nAnd so you can just go ahead and just mix and match\\nany type of setting that you would like to apply.\\nBut you always have to choose one from every single list,\\nwhile with the effects, you can just mix and match\\nas much as you want by combining multiple effects together.\\n\\nLet's change the last option here, which is lighting.\\nSo here I can basically set what type of a mood\\nI would like to add to the image itself.\\nSo for example, if I choose something like multi exposure\\nand then choose generate,\\nI should get something that's quite interesting.\\nI'm actually combining a multi exposure shot now\\nwith muted colors.\\nAnd I have to say I'm quite curious to see\\nwhat that is going to look like.\\nI'll give this a few more seconds.\\nAnd now again, I have something\\nthat looks radically different.\\nNow, conveying something like this specifically in words\\nwill just be impossible for me,\\nbut just playing around with these visual settings\\ndoes give me a lot of room to wiggle with.\\n\\nLet's take a look at a few more examples.\\nHere I have a few more tabs open\\nwhere I have changed the settings again\\nusing the exact same prompt.\\nSo here for example, I'm using a combination\\nof studio light, cool tone and surface detail.\\nAnd you can see that I'm now really focusing on the details\\nof the flower and the details in the butterfly,\\nwhile the background has a very heavy depth of blur effect.\\nSo this gives me, again, a very subtle image.\\nI really like this result, by the way.\\n\\nLet's look at another example.\\nHere, same thing.\\nShallow depth of field, toned image during golden hour.\\nAnd again, I'm getting a very, very different result here\\nusing the exact same prompt.\\nAnd putting this into words would just take me\\nlike an extra paragraph of text,\\nwhile now I can have a very simple text prompt\\nin a combination of multiple settings.\\nLet's do one last one.\\nSo here I actually changed the prompt, as well.\\nSo here in this image I'm looking at a penguin\\nwalking through the ocean waves,\\nand that's exactly what I'm getting.\\n\\nBut the only thing I changed was this setting,\\nwhich is backlighting.\\nSo if I use something like this,\\nI'm really getting the sense\\nthat this image was taken during sunset.\\nAnd this is something that I no longer have to specify\\nspecifically in the prompt itself,\\nwhich means that this is going to, let's just say,\\ndeclutter my prompt in a way of speaking.\\nSo this really allows me to express myself\\na lot better and a lot easier by simply using\\nvisual settings instead of just overloading the prompt box\\nall the time with more words\\nand more room for misinterpretation from Firefly.\\n\\nSo next time you want to add a wow factor to your image\\nor just want to make it look more professional,\\nbe sure to scroll all the way to the bottom\\nof the available settings\\nand make sure that you make a conscious decision\\nabout lighting, colors and composition.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2722030\",\"duration\":423,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using a Structure

[Instructor] Imagine this.\\nYou're trying to explain the concept\\nof a new marketing graphic to your coworker,\\nand you notice that using words alone simply doesn't cut it.\\nSo instead, you make a quick sketch on the whiteboard,\\nor even on a paper napkin,\\nto help visualize what that image looks like.\\nNow that paper napkin is what we'll be using today,\\nand that napkin,\\nwhich we will call a structure reference from now on,\\ncan indeed be a simple hand-drawn sketch,\\nbut it can also be a completely different image,\\nhere inside of Firefly.\\n\\nNow the opportunities of this specific feature are so broad\\nthat I've created five examples to help you understand\\njust how powerful this really is.\\nNow to help you along this exercise,\\nI have created five individual prompts\\nwith very specific settings,\\nand I have created a separate link to every prompt\\nand saved them here inside of promptlinks.txt.\\nSo be sure to open up these links\\nas you want to follow along during this exercise.\\nLet's start with the first one.\\n\\nHere I'm trying to create a tropical island scene.\\nSo I typed in the prompt\\n\\\"A tropical island scene during sunset,\\\" comma space,\\n\\\"Featuring palm trees and mountains in the background.\\\"\\nI used a variety of settings,\\nincluding a different content type, aspect ratio,\\nand an effect, to get to this result.\\nAnd I got to say I'm actually quite happy with this.\\nHowever, I'm going to change the structure of the image.\\nI'll just go ahead and choose Close,\\nand take a look here at this structure pane.\\n\\nNow, what this does is,\\nthis allows me to reference a secondary image,\\nand then use that structure as a type of blueprint\\nto help direct what the prompt results should look like.\\nNow, let's take a look here.\\nI'll choose Browse gallery to look at some of the images\\nthat ship with Adobe Firefly.\\nNow of course I can always upload my own,\\nbut for now, I'm going to stick to the ones\\nthat ship with Firefly\\njust for these first couple of prompts.\\nNow there are three categories,\\nthere's Abstract, Photography, and Line drawing,\\nand I'm going to choose this one.\\n\\nSo simply click that one,\\nand you can see that I'm now referring to an image\\nfeaturing a river, maybe some islands, shorelines,\\nand some trees, in the bottom left corner of the image.\\nNow with that active selection, I'll just choose Generate\\nto update my prompt, and this is the result I'm getting,\\nI am getting the same flow in that same river,\\nsame perspective.\\nThis is a really great combination of the prompt\\nwith that structure reference.\\nLet me show you another example.\\n\\nHere I'm using floating delicious scoops of ice cream,\\nbut the ice cream is kind of all over the place.\\nSo let's put some structure in this image.\\nI'll choose Browse gallery again,\\nand I'll choose this specific image\\nwith these free-floating spheres.\\nI'll just go ahead here and click Generate,\\nand I'll try and generate these same scoops\\nusing that same circular pattern\\nI see here in the reference image.\\nAnd now, this is what I'm getting,\\nand this would've been very difficult to explain\\njust using words.\\n\\nLet's look at a third example.\\nHere I'm using a prompt that's very simple,\\n\\\"A bookcase filled with books.\\\"\\nIt's a square image.\\nAnd this is exactly what I'm looking for, however,\\nwhat if you want to radically change\\nwhat that image actually looks like?\\nLet's choose Browse gallery\\nand look at some of these examples.\\nNow it kind of makes sense\\nthat I'm using a reference to a landscape\\nfor a landscape prompt,\\nor I'm using a reference of round spherical shapes\\nfor other round spherical shapes,\\nfor example, the ice cream scoops.\\n\\nBut what if I want to change something like this bookcase\\nbased on something that has nothing to do with bookcases?\\nFor example, here in the photography category,\\nI'll choose this image,\\nwhich is a very specific perspective,\\nand this is a picture of a building.\\nNow I don't want to recreate the blue sky\\nnear the building wall, I just want to have the structure.\\nI'll just make sure this is selected, I'll click Generate,\\nand now I have a completely different bookcase\\nin the exact same perspective.\\n\\nLet's keep moving.\\nHere, I have a fourth example with, again,\\na whole bunch of different settings.\\nI'm using Firefly Image model two\\nbecause I had a slightly better result here,\\nand I have a whole variety\\nof different settings and effects.\\nBe sure to use that URL I supply to you in the text file\\nto click along.\\nNow let me choose something that is radically different,\\nhere in the Structure reference, I'll choose Browse gallery,\\nand I'll choose this very first abstract cube pattern.\\n\\nNow this has clearly nothing to do with the coffee cup,\\nwhich is a carton coffee cup.\\nIt has nothing to do with the coffee beans,\\nit's just an abstract shape.\\nNow with this selected, I'll choose Generate.\\nAnd now this is a very interesting result,\\nI'm actually getting\\na different interpretation of my prompt.\\nI'm still getting the coffee beans, same color, same vibe,\\nsame background, but it has taken the material\\nof the coffee cup itself\\nand combined that with the abstract cubes,\\nand it actually filled that up with the coffee beans.\\n\\nThis is something that, I'll be honest,\\nI would never have thought of doing this myself.\\nBut this is, again, one of those little happy accidents.\\nLet me show you the very last example, which is this one.\\nSo here I have a pretty long prompt.\\nSo I have \\\"A woman captured in a contemplative pose.\\n\\\"The lighting casts a vibrant contrast of red and blue hues\\n\\\"across the scene, adding a dramatic and artistic effect.\\n\\\"The face is turned away from the camera.\\\"\\nSo I'm describing the look and feel of the image,\\nbut there's one thing I'm not really describing,\\nwhich is the actual pose of the woman's body.\\n\\nAnd we could be using a structure reference for that one.\\nAnd, in this example, I brought my own.\\nSo, if you take a look here at these options,\\nyou can actually upload your own image.\\nSo I'm going to take a look here at the project files.\\nAnd here I have this specific stock image\\nthat I would like to upload.\\nI'll just simply click and drag the image here\\ninto this box, to drop it in.\\nAnd notice I now have a strength slider,\\nwhich is a bit like the visual intensity slider,\\nwhich basically means, how faithful should this result be\\nbased on the reference image I now imported.\\n\\nI'm just going to go ahead\\nand crank this all the way up\\nto make sure that I do take this in as best as I can.\\nI'll just go ahead and click Generate.\\nAnd now let's take a look what happens.\\nAnd now it has taken the exact same pose of this woman,\\nand combined that with all the atmospheric descriptions\\nI put in here in this command line.\\nSo here I'm describing what this scene looks like\\nin combination with a low lighting effect,\\nbut the structure reference is describing the exact pose,\\nthe physical pose of my model.\\n\\nPretty amazing.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5940028\",\"duration\":331,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating your own Structure

[Instructor] Now that you have a good understanding\\nof what a structure reference is,\\nit's time to create your very own using Adobe Photoshop.\\nI'm here inside of Photoshop, and I'm ready to get started.\\nI'll just go ahead and click the New File button.\\nAnd I want to create a file that measures 1,000 pixels\\nby 1,000 pixels.\\nI'm using 72 PPI and I'm starting out\\nwith a wide background.\\nI'll just go ahead and choose Create to get started.\\nNow I would like to create an inscription\\nof the word \\\"Flower\\\" surrounded by other flowers.\\n\\nSo let's go ahead and choose the Type tool\\nhere on the left-hand side.\\nI'll just go ahead and click in the middle of the screen.\\nI'll just start it by typing in the word \\\"Flower.\\\"\\nAnd I'm using this specific font here.\\nI'm using Bello Script Pro,\\nwhich is a font you can just synchronize\\nfrom the Adobe Font Service.\\nNow, obviously, for this exercise,\\nyou can choose any font that you like\\nbecause it all comes down\\nto how you want your structure reference to look like.\\nI do want this to be a little bit bigger, though,\\nso I'll just go ahead and select the text.\\nI'll just type in something like 250 points.\\n\\nI'll hit Enter or Return to confirm.\\nI'll just use the Move tool just to position\\nthis a bit more in the center of my canvas.\\nNow it's time to add the flowers.\\nI'm going to go ahead here and choose the Custom Shape tool\\non the left-hand side, and make sure that here at the top\\nof the screen Shape and a black fill are currently selected.\\nNow, if I click the Shape op in itself,\\nyou can see that I have four different categories of shapes.\\nI have wild animals, leaf trees, boats, and flowers.\\nI'm going to go ahead and choose this flower\\nwith the pointy leaves.\\n\\nI'll just start to click and drag by holding\\non the Shift key to drag my first flower.\\nNow you can always reposition the flower by simply switching\\nto the

now.\\nI'll just change to a shape\\nthat has more rounded leaves like this,\\nand let's add one version here\\nand then maybe one mid-size version there.\\n\\nNow I'm actually quite happy with this.\\nIt's very simple, but you'll understand\\nhow this is going to work when you use this\\nas a structure reference.\\nLet's save this document.\\nI'm going to go in here and choose File, Export,\\nSave for Web Legacy,\\nand then make sure that JPEG is selected here\\nin this pull down menu.\\nI'll just go ahead and click the Save option\\nand I'll save this as reference.jpeg.\\nNow choose Save, and now I'm ready to go into Adobe Firefly.\\n\\nSo here inside of Adobe Firefly,\\nI'm ready to type in my prompt.\\nI'll put my cursor in here.\\nI'll just make sure this is empty,\\nand let's just start typing something.\\nI will start by typing in the following prompt.\\n\\\"The word flower on a knitted background,\\\"\\ncomma, space.\\n\\\"Surrounded by knitted flowers.\\\"\\nAnd I'll hit Enter or Return to confirm.\\nNow it's going to interpret the prompt\\nas it currently is using the square aspect ratio,\\nand it's still making up its mind whether this should\\nbe an art or a photo.\\n\\nNow we just have to refine this a little bit more\\nbecause it's not quite looking the way\\nI was hoping this was going to look.\\nSo let's just quickly look at some\\nof these available options.\\nFirst of all, we have to set the structure reference itself,\\nso go back to the finder,\\nand let's just drag and drop in that reference.jpeg\\ninto the structure reference here.\\nI'll choose continue, and now I'm ready to continue.\\nNow keep in mind that if you want this to really respect\\nthe look and feel of the font that you picked,\\nyou do have to make sure that you put the strength slider\\nall the way toward your right.\\n\\nAnd now, I'm going to scroll down just a little bit more\\nbecause I'm going to click the Materials option inside\\nof the Effects panel.\\nI'm going to scroll all the way down\\nand choose the Yarn Effect.\\nNow choose generate to refresh the prompt,\\nand let's see what this does.\\nAnd now this is the result I'm getting.\\nSo I'm literally getting the word flower\\non a knitted background surrounded by knitted flowers.\\nSo if I click and look at these specific results here,\\nyou can see that this looks a bit like cardboard.\\n\\nI'm not quite sure.\\nI didn't specify what the material should have been\\nof the word flower, but I did specify the background\\nand also the flowers themselves.\\nKeep in mind that this is actually also making a distinction\\nbetween the flowers or the petals were pointy versus round.\\nIf I just go through these different results,\\nyou can see that the position of these flowers was respected\\nand it's also done a really good job interpreting the shape,\\nour outline of this very specific font.\\n\\nNow you can go absolutely crazy\\nwith these different references.\\nLet me show you one more example\\nthat I have done here beforehand.\\nSo here for example, I've taken this version\\nof the LinkedIn Learning logo.\\nIt's a rounded interpretation of the logo,\\nwhich kind of gave me some room for interpretation.\\nSo I've taken this as a structure reference,\\nand I have taken this to create this as a bubble\\nwhere I have the i, the dot of the i here\\nas an extra air bubble.\\nOr I have this version where I have is carved in a rock\\nor a cliff.\\n\\nOr this version where this is a top view of a fountain,\\nor maybe neon sign, or maybe toast.\\nSo you can actually use this not just for text,\\nbut you can also use this to interpret logos\\nin a very original way.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5943033\",\"duration\":250,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using a Style

[Instructor] There is one final setting\\nthat we have not discussed yet,\\nwhich is the match style setting.\\nNow, match style allows you to assign a secondary image\\nto your prompt, just like a structure reference.\\nHowever, this time Firefly will mimic the visual style\\nof the image and apply that style to your prompt.\\nSo this means that the shapes, the style, texture,\\ncolor, theme, anything that makes your image look unique\\nwill be copied and applied to the prompt\\nthat you're currently creating.\\n\\nLet's take a look at a very simple example.\\nHere inside Adobe Firefly, I have reused\\none of the previous prompts that you've learned before,\\nwhich is a dog wearing glasses reading a book.\\nAnd I'm getting different variations\\nof that specific prompt, and everything is absolutely fine.\\nNow what I'm going to look here at\\nis I want to change the visual style, the visual look\\nand feel of that image based on another image.\\nNow, if I scroll down this list of options here,\\nyou will find the styles category.\\n\\nAnd as you can see, you can also choose any of these images\\nas part of a gallery, just like you have this option here\\ninside of the structure reference.\\nSo let's take a look at what we have available.\\nI'll just go ahead and choose Browse gallery,\\nand from here I have the option\\nto choose from a whole plethora of visual styles.\\nSo I have acrylic and oil references,\\nI have watercolor paintings,\\npencil drawings, 3D renders.\\nI have a lot to choose from.\\nNow you are obviously free to upload your own artwork\\nto mimic your own style while you're creating a prompt\\ndepicting a different scene.\\n\\nLet me show you a couple of different variations here\\njust to show you just how powerful\\nthis can really, really get.\\nSo I'm just going to go ahead and click the 3D render option,\\nwhich will add this here as a style reference.\\nI'll just go ahead and click Generate\\nto reinterpret the prompt of a dog wearing glasses\\nreading a book as if it was rendered\\nusing the exact same 3D styles and objects\\nas we have here in this specific render,\\nand this is the result we're getting.\\nI think this is probably the best iteration\\nof that style reference.\\n\\nLet's try this again.\\nLet's try and do this type\\nof acrylic and oil painting this time.\\nI'll just go ahead and select that.\\nI'll choose Generate, and let's reinterpret the same prompt.\\nNow keep in mind that the style reference itself\\nmight not have nothing to do with the subject\\nof which you're trying to prompt a different scene,\\nwhich means that you might have this specific scene here\\nfeaturing a woman\\nwhile you're now creating a prompt of a dog.\\nNow, as you can see here, this really gives me the same look\\nand feel of that specific image.\\n\\nNow I've gone ahead\\nand I've experimented a little bit more on your behalf.\\nLet me show you a few more examples.\\nSo here you have the exact same prompt,\\nbut I used this reference here in the bottom left corner\\nto change this prompt.\\nNow this looks very, very different.\\nLet's look at this example where I'm using a different type\\nof artist style,\\nor this version where I have a different type of 3D render.\\nOr maybe this version where, again,\\nI have a very different way, a different abstract way\\nof depicting the exact same dog.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, this one where I seem to have\\na continuous line effect here\\ngoing through this design.\\nSo keep in mind\\nthat using these visual references can really allow you\\nto change the look and feel of the image,\\nand very often, maybe even better\\nbased on the effect category that you have here as well.\\nThe only difference is\\nthat if you use the effects option here,\\nit's just going to add that as an extra ingredient\\nto your prompt.\\nWhile if you're using the style reference,\\nit will completely transform what the image might look like,\\nand it'll take in the same theme, texture, color theme,\\nand it will apply that to the prompt\\nthat you currently have.\\n\\nAnd also keep in mind\\nthat you can even start to make

[Instructor] Now that we've covered\\nall available options and features\\nwhen creating a text prompt,\\nit's time to bring it all together.\\nNow, let's look at a slightly more complex example.\\nI've started out here inside of Adobe Firefly\\nwhere I typed in a very simple prompt,\\n\\\"A statue of an ibis bird,\\\"\\nand I'm getting these types of results,\\nwhich is literally a statue of an ibis bird.\\nBut I would like to have more control\\nover this entire prompt,\\nso what I've done beforehand is the following.\\nI've actually gone ahead\\nand I've created this prompt,\\na beautiful block of colored marble,\\nand this is what Firefly gave me.\\n\\nI really love the texture of this marble.\\nI like the oranges, I like the whites,\\nand I like the greens.\\nSo I would like to reuse this material\\nas another prompt here instead of Adobe Firefly.\\nSo I basically created another prompt\\nto help me build the next prompt.\\nI'll just quickly close this preview\\nand let's bring this into Adobe Firefly.\\nNow, first of all, I need to put this in here\\nas a style reference.\\nNot a structure reference, a style reference,\\nbecause I want to recreate this particular type of marble.\\n\\nNow, to do so, simply scroll down this list of options\\nuntil you see the Styles category,\\nand then simply drag and drop in this image like so,\\nchoose Continue,\\nand then just simply click Generate to refresh the prompt.\\nNow, keep in mind\\nthat when you add something as a style reference,\\nyou also have the same strength slider\\nas you have here on top of the structure references,\\nwhich means how literal should we be depicting\\nor should we be reusing this exact same texture?\\nNow, here in this instance,\\nI'm getting a bit of a 50/50 result here.\\n\\nThis looks pretty good,\\nwhile this result is,\\nI think this is probably a real bird faking to be a statue.\\nSo let's quickly go back into the options\\nand let's crank up the strength all the way to the right\\nand let's click Generate again\\njust to refresh this specific example.\\nNow, as this is loading,\\nI can already tell you\\nthat while this is just fixing the texture of the statue,\\nI also want to change the position of the statue itself.\\nNow, this is looking a lot more promising,\\nnow I really have the feeling\\nthat my particular type of marble has been reused\\nto sculpt out this statue of an ibis.\\n\\nNow, let's quickly click away.\\nLet's fix the position here of the specific image.\\nNow, if I take a look at these options,\\nI need to use a structure reference.\\nAnd if I look at the browse gallery option here,\\nI can see that here inside of the Line drawing category,\\nthere is another bird that is sitting on a branch,\\nor let's just call it a surface for now,\\nand the bird is facing the right.\\nI'll just click this option,\\nwhich is going to add this as a structure reference\\nin top of the style reference.\\n\\nI'll just go ahead and click Generate\\nto reinterpret my statue,\\nand I'm expecting the statue\\nto also be positioned on a surface\\npointing to the right side of my screen.\\nLet's give us a few seconds\\nand see how Firefly interprets this combination.\\nAnd there we have it then,\\nthis looks again a lot better.\\nSo now I have a different version of the same rendering,\\nand I can keep going,\\nI can keep refining\\nwhat this prompt might potentially look like.\\nNow, I'll quickly click\\nthe left pointing arrow here to go back\\nand keep in mind that whenever you're using\\na structure reference,\\nyou can also choose to crank up the strength slider\\nand then just refresh this prompt.\\n\\nNow, you can always mix and match\\ndifferent combinations of strength as you see fit.\\nThe only thing that you're just consuming\\nare these generative credits,\\nso be sure to keep experimenting as you go along.\\nI'll just give this a few more seconds\\nand I'm getting a slightly better result.\\nNow, let's just finish off here at the bottom of the screen\\nby adding a different lighting and color setting.\\nI'll just go ahead here and I'll change the lighting\\nto something like Studio light.\\nI'll change the camera angle to,\\nlet's just say we want to use something like a Closeup shot,\\nlet's choose this option here,\\nand I'll choose Generate\\njust to get to hopefully my final iteration of this prompt.\\n\\nNow, keep in mind in general\\nthat you can just go ahead\\nand you can mix and match different materials\\nwith different structure references\\nand different camera angles\\nuntil you're completely satisfied.\\nNow, this here looks a lot better.\\nJust by changing the light and the closeup shot,\\nI'm now getting something that looks radically different.\\nNow, I have to say that I am stepping away\\nfrom the ibis concept a little bit,\\nI do have this specific beak here,\\nbut I got to say it, this looks very realistic.\\nNow, last thing I do want to share with all of you\\njust before I let you go is the following.\\n\\nWhenever you find an image that you really like,\\nkeep in mind that you always have a way of reusing,\\nof recycling the output that you just generated here\\nas an input for your next prompt.\\nAnd you can do so by clicking the Edit option\\nand then choosing any of these options here.\\nNow, we have already explained what Generates similar does,\\nbut now you'll understand how I can use this output\\nas a structure reference for my next prompt\\nor as a style reference for my next prompt.\\n\\nSo now I think the circle is complete\\nand you know exactly how to generate\\nall these images from scratch\\nand how to reuse these images to create new prompts.\\nNow, my advice for you as I let you go\\nis actually very simple,\\njust try and experiment\\nand the moment you find something you're happy with,\\nbe sure to hit the Favorite option\\nso you can always go back to previous versions.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5938042\",\"duration\":54,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge: Creating a Structure

[Instructor] Let's look at what I think\\nis one of the most interesting features\\nin Adobe Firefly, Generative Fill.\\nNow, in the previous few chapters,\\nyou learned how to use a text prompt\\nto create an entire image from scratch.\\nHowever, what do you do\\nwhen you want to selectively edit\\njust a part of an existing image using generative AI?\\nAnd that's exactly where Generative Fill comes in.\\nThis technology allows you to surgically alter\\njust a part of an image\\nby making simple text selections\\nand then prompting what you want to generate in those areas.\\n\\nNow let's take a look at the Generative Fill first\\njust to show off a few examples.\\nI'll just scroll down here.\\nI'm going to make a stop here at the Generative Fill option.\\nI'll just go ahead and click this to enter the gallery.\\nNow, these projects seem to look very similar\\nto what we had before using text to image.\\nEverything looks to be AI generated.\\nBut let's hover over one of these projects.\\nFor example, this project here.\\nSo here we have an original image\\nof a young lady wearing an orange jacket\\nand there's also a background in the image.\\n\\nMaybe that original background was a coffee shop,\\nmaybe it's a restaurant, I'm not quite sure.\\nBut what happens is that when I hover over this example,\\nyou can actually see all the alterations\\nthat were made to that image using Generative Fill.\\nAnd this is something that's actually very, very powerful\\nbecause this is a selection-based workflow\\nwhere you can just simply click to select the background\\nor simply brush to select other areas in the image\\nand then make those changes.\\nNow, if I just go ahead\\nand just click this image just to open this up,\\nyou will see the Generative Fill interface.\\n\\nNow, the tools you see here on the left-hand side\\nare super accessible,\\nand I cannot emphasize this enough,\\nas long as you know how to operate a mouse and the keyboard,\\nyou can now manipulate images\\nwithout having received any formal education\\nin graphic design,\\nwhile others have to still install and learn Photoshop\\nto achieve the same thing.\\nAnd this is something\\nthat enables anyone in your organization\\nto basically create or ideate what is they want\\nin a fraction of the time compared to Photoshop.\\n\\nNow, this was just a brief introduction\\nof what Generative Fill can do,\\nbut now that we know what to do, let's quickly go back here\\nby clicking the left pointing arrow\\nand let's start out in this gallery\\nwhere we can now start to upload our very own image\\nand try this out for the very first

[Instructor] It's time to look\\nat our very first Generative Fill project.\\nNow, to get started,\\nwe have to upload an image first into Adobe Firefly,\\nand I have just the image to get started with.\\nSo let me just go back to the finder window here.\\nI'm going to take a look at this document, breakfast.jpeg,\\nwhich you can find in the Project folder.\\nLet me quickly just open up a preview.\\nThis is what the original image looks like.\\nNow, I'm quite happy with the image overall.\\nHowever, we seem to be missing a couple\\nof key elements here in this photo shoot,\\nand we'll be using Generative Fill to fix just that.\\n\\nNow, to get started, simply drag this image here\\ninto the Generative Fill interface,\\nand it's going to open up that interface for me now.\\nLet's explore the interface before we get started.\\nNow, on the left-hand side, I have my main tools.\\nI have an Insert tool, which allows me to insert objects,\\nI have a Remove tool, which allows me to remove objects,\\nand I have an Expand tool,\\nwhich allows me to expand the canvas\\nand generate more image.\\nNow, I'm going to start out here with the Insert tool\\nfor this specific exercise.\\n\\nWhen you use this tool, a brush is required,\\nand you can see the brush settings here\\nat the bottom of the screen.\\nNow, if you simply click and drag in the image,\\nyou're going to start brushing an area in this image.\\nNow, this is the Add mode,\\nwhich means you're going to keep adding\\nto that current selection.\\nIf you want, you can click Subtract\\nto then brush over this area\\nto basically remove part of this brushed area.\\nIt's a bit like switching to an eraser tool.\\nNow, I'll go back to the Add option here,\\nand let's take a look at a few additional options.\\n\\nHere, you can click to change specific brush settings,\\nincluding the size, hardness, and opacity.\\nBut if you're like me,\\nI like using keyboard shortcuts just like in Photoshop,\\nwhich means that you can actually use the open\\nand closing brackets on the keyboard\\nto open and close the brush size you have here\\nby increasing and decreasing the value you have here.\\nSo I basically use my hand on the keyboard\\nwhile I'm brushing here in this area.\\nNow, you can actually use other shortcuts as well.\\n\\nIf you press Command + Plus like this,\\nyou're going to be zooming in this image.\\nIf you press Command + Minus on the keyboard,\\nwhich is your Control + Plus and Control + Minus,\\nthen you'll be zooming out just like in Photoshop.\\nAnd then obviously, if you want, there is a Pan tool\\nto pan through the image in this gallery.\\nNow, let's go ahead and insert our very first object.\\nI'll go back to the Insert tool.\\nI'm going to go in here and make sure\\nthat I have a brush that's a little bit bigger,\\nso I'm just going to make sure\\nthat I'm going to increase this a bit,\\nlet's say around 75 points.\\n\\nNow, simply click and drag to brush in this area.\\nNow, what I would like to do is,\\nI would like to insert a teaspoon\\nbecause clearly we're missing a spoon here\\nin this photo shoot.\\nNow, the moment you're done brushing,\\nthere's a prompt that pops up\\nthat's requesting you to name the object\\nthat you would like to insert in this composition.\\nI'm going to go ahead and just click in here.\\nI'll type in, Teaspoon,\\nand I'll go ahead and click Generate.\\nSo now Firefly is generating a local object\\nthat's completely rendered into this image,\\nand I'll have three options to choose from.\\n\\nLet's give this a few seconds and see what it does.\\nThis is the first version,\\nI got to say, it looks really good.\\nThis is the second version,\\nand this is the third version.\\nWell, clearly the first version is a winner.\\nNow, if you're not quite satisfied\\nwith any of these results,\\nyou can click the More option\\nto generate additional results,\\nand you can create as many as you like\\nas long as you have generative credits to play with.\\nNow, I'm going to go ahead and just accept this specific change\\nby clicking the Keep option,\\nwhich means it's going to finalize this render,\\nand now I can go back and make those changes again.\\n\\nNow, what I particularly like is the fact\\nthat these reflections in the cup\\nand the shadows here on the saucer,\\nthey all look supernatural\\nbecause Firefly has located the source\\nof lighting in this image,\\nand it's trying to replicate that exact same environment.\\nLet's try this again.\\nLet's add a tiny little spoon here into these little jars.\\nI'm going to basically press the Left Bracket key\\nto make my brush size a bit smaller.\\nI'm just going to go ahead and just drag one line like so,\\nand I'll come in here, and I'll type in, Tiny Spoon.\\n\\nAnd again, I'm going to go ahead and click Generate\\nto generate that spoon.\\nNow, this is a glass surface,\\nwhich is, again, pretty exciting\\nbecause this spoon has to appear\\nin front of this area of the glass\\nand should potentially blend\\nthrough this area of the glass in the foreground.\\nLet me pick that one, it's a wooden spoon.\\nI didn't specify the material obviously,\\nbut let's go ahead and click the More option\\njust to create three additional results.\\nLet's give this a couple of seconds,\\nand let's see what else we can choose.\\n\\nActually, I'm quite happy with this one.\\nI'll choose keep, I'm going to keep going.\\nI'm going to increase the brush size significantly.\\nI'm going to brush this area here.\\nAnd notice that the area I'm currently brushing in\\nis actually out of focus.\\nIt's not even sharp in the image,\\nbut that's absolutely fine.\\nLet's add a bowl of cereal, A Bowl of Cereal.\\nAnd I'll go ahead and click Enter or Return\\njust to create that specific object.\\nNow, keep in mind that the background\\nof the image is out of focus,\\nwhich means that the bowl of cereal\\nshould also be out of focus\\nin order to have a more natural effect.\\n\\nThis is not looking too bad, I'm going to go for this one here.\\nI'll choose Keep, and I'm going to finish off\\nby maybe brushing this area like so.\\nAnd I'm going to type in, A White Teapot,\\nand again, Enter or Return to confirm.\\nAnd then we should end up with a teapot\\nthat's hopefully looking half decent.\\nSo let's see what it does.\\nHmm, this is not too bad.\\nThis is a bit better.\\nThis is a bit weird.\\nLet's just quickly go for this one.\\n\\nLet's go ahead and choose Keep,\\nand now I have made four very quick manipulations.\\nBut let's submit it.\\nIf we were to do this in Photoshop,\\nthis would've taken us at least an hour\\nor maybe a couple of hours,\\nand I'm just going through the ideation phase\\nin a matter of minutes.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5938041\",\"duration\":302,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Replacing image

image in here to get started.\\nNow, this is a librarian\\nand she does an amazing job, I got to say,\\nhowever, she has always dreamt of being a chef.\\n\\nSo I would say let's grant her wish by using Firefly.\\nSo I'm going to go ahead and just make sure\\nI have the Insert tool currently selected.\\nAnd let's just quickly change your clothes a little bit.\\nSo make sure you have a brush that's large enough.\\nI'm actually going to increase the brush size a little bit\\nby pressing the right bracket key on the keyboard.\\nI'm going to come in here, I'm going to start dragging, like so.\\nI'm just going to make sure I cover this entire area.\\n\\nLet's do the outline of her body first,\\nand then let's quickly fill in the part in the middle,\\njust by brushing, brushing, brushing, brushing.\\nThere we go.\\nNow, currently I do have a brush\\nthat is a bit blurry around the edges.\\nSo if you take a look at the brush options here,\\nyou can see that I do have a hardness of 50%.\\nIt comes out of the box like that.\\nSo these are the default settings.\\nSo what I do like to do is I like\\nto decrease this value just a tiny bit.\\n\\nLet's say to 25-ish percent\\nand I'll have a smaller brush size.\\nI'm going to decrease the brush size,\\nso I'm pressing the left bracket on the keyboard,\\njust to kind of move into this little area here,\\njust to do this,\\nbecause this area should be manipulated as well.\\nAnd let's do this area a bit.\\nThere we go.\\nI think I'm kind of down with this.\\nNow, let's click inside this prompt here,\\nand I'm going to type in something very simple.\\nI'll just type in chef\\nand I'll hit Enter or Return to confirm.\\n\\nNow, what it's doing is it's going\\nto interpret the prompt based on my selection of the image.\\nAnd so, Firefly should now automatically\\ndetect the fact that we're trying to change\\nthe outfit of the subject.\\nNow, this is one version, this is another version.\\nThis is a bit odd, I got to say.\\nWe've got this version.\\nHmm, let's keep going.\\nLet's click the More option\\njust to get a few more different versions going.\\nNow, if I don't get the version\\nor the result I'm looking for now,\\nI'll just quickly go back and just quickly alter\\nthat prompt a little bit here.\\n\\nNow, this is not too bad,\\nbut it's not really reminding me of a chef's outfit.\\nYou know what?\\nLet's just quickly hit the Cancel option.\\nLet's type in chef's outfit and then hit Enter or Return.\\nLet's be a bit more specific.\\nNow, I did previous tests\\nwhere just typing in chef did did a really good job.\\nHowever, now I'll just come in and be a bit more specific.\\nAh, now this is what I'm looking for.\\nThis is good.\\nThis is actually not too bad.\\nI'm going to go for the first one.\\nLet's try and use this one instead.\\nI'll just go ahead and click the Keep option.\\n\\nAnd this is our first manipulation.\\nNow, I also need to change the background\\nbecause who needs a chef\\nwhen you're working in a library, right?\\nSo where does a chef live and work?\\nWell, let's just hope not live.\\nIt's in the kitchen.\\nSo let's quickly go ahead and try and select his background.\\nAnd to do that, simply click this option\\nthat says Select background.\\nNow, this is going to use something similar\\nlike the select subject technology\\nthat you might be familiar with in Photoshop.\\nAnd because we have manipulated the outfit before,\\nit is now basing itself on these outlines as well.\\n\\nAnd now it's a matter of just typing in the prompt\\nfor the replacement background, which should be a kitchen.\\nJust type in the word kitchen\\nand I'll choose Generate\\nto generate a kitchen area for this particular subject.\\nLet's give this a couple of seconds\\nand see what Firefly can give us.\\nOkay, this is pretty good-looking.\\nI'm loving the greens on the left-hand side here.\\nThis is another version.\\nThis is okay, but this is a bit weird in the background,\\nI have to say.\\n\\nThis is also not too bad.\\nYou know what?\\nI'm going to click the More option\\njust once more because I do want to have six choices\\nto choose from and not just three.\\nOkay, more kitchens.\\nAgain, not bad.\\nNot bad.\\nActually, I'm going to go for the very first one.\\nSo I'm going to go in here and click the Left option,\\njust to cycle through these other results here,\\nuntil I land with this version here.\\nNow, keep in mind that you also have this ellipsis icon,\\nand when you click that, you can actually also report\\nhow much you loved or hated this specific result.\\n\\nFor now, I'm actually quite satisfied.\\nI'm just going to go ahead and click the Keep option.\\nAnd now, we've done it.\\nWe have changed this person

[Instructor] Did you know that removing objects\\nfrom images is just as easy\\nas adding objects to images using Generative Fill?\\nLet me prove that to you using this particular exercise.\\nNow there's one particular file I would like you to use,\\nand it's called pool.jpeg,\\nwhich you can find in the project folder.\\nThis is the preview of the image.\\nNow it features a pool and we have a few deck chairs\\nhere next to the pool.\\nNow imagine the following scenario.\\nYou are asked to remove all\\nof these deck chairs on the right-hand side,\\nincluding the shadows.\\n\\nNow I'll be honest with you,\\nI tried to do this using traditional\\nPhotoshop tools and I failed miserably.\\nAnd the reason why I failed miserably\\nis because I was using these traditional tools in Photoshop,\\nlike the Clone Stamp tool, for example,\\nor Content-Aware Fill, and these are all tools\\nthat rely on the source information\\nthat is already available in the image\\nand nothing more, which means that if I have\\nto fill up this area here with a blank area,\\nbasically, I'm going to get into trouble.\\n\\nNow Photoshop is able to recreate some of the wall texture\\nbecause there's a lot of wall to sample from\\nto cover up this overlapping area.\\nBut here at the ground surface, that is very challenging\\nbecause if I select the whole thing,\\nthere's really no area in this image to source from\\nto replace my selection, which results in very poor results,\\na long time spent on Photoshop, let me tell you,\\nand me as a user being quite frustrated\\nbecause I'm supposed to be good at this.\\n\\nNow let me show you how easy this is using gen AI.\\nI'll drag this image in.\\nThere we go.\\nAnd now we're going to use this simple interface\\nto do something that is actually very complex.\\nNow first we have to switch from the insert tool,\\nwhich inserts objects, to the remove tool,\\nwhich allows me to remove objects.\\nNow I'm also going to increase\\nmy brush size a little bit here.\\nSo I'll press the right bracket on the keyboard.\\nI'm going to use something like this,\\nsomething around 90 pixels.\\n\\nAnd now simply brush the area\\nthat you would like to get rid of.\\nNow this also includes the shadows.\\nSo just basically, let's just keep brushing.\\nSo let's brush this area here.\\nLet's add this area to the selection and just keep going.\\nJust fill up this area here.\\nAnd you know what?\\nI'm not going to make a distinction here.\\nI'll just keep brushing.\\nI'll just take in the entire area\\nand I'll let go of the mouse.\\nAnd now it's very simple.\\n\\nThere's a button that says remove.\\nLet's click remove.\\nNow what it's actually doing is the end result\\nlooks like I will have removed these objects,\\nbut it's actually inserting textures and materials.\\nWe're already done.\\nSo Firefly has sampled this texture that we have here.\\nIt has sampled the texture in the background\\nand it's just generating more of that.\\nIt's generating more pixels.\\nAnd that's not the beginning.\\nI have three versions.\\n\\nI have this version, this version, and then that version.\\nAnd I think I like this version best.\\nAnd just simply go ahead\\nand click the Keep option and I'm done.\\nI can go to that actual pool and drink margaritas now\\nbecause I am done working.\\nAnd this is how quickly you can actually\\nmake a basic selection, hit that remove button,\\nand then watch the magic unfold.\\nNow this is a bit empty.\\nSo just to finish off this exercise, let's just go in here\\nand click the insert tool again.\\nLet's just increase the brush size a little bit.\\n\\nAnd what if we just make a round selection like so,\\nand I'll just type something in like\\na beach ball and I'll hit Enter\\nor Return just to see what Firefly can give me.\\nNow clearly the light's coming from this side of the image.\\nYou can tell by looking at the source.\\nYou can tell by looking at the shadows here.\\nAnd I got to say, this looks really, really interesting.\\nThe light's coming from the exact same direction.\\nIt has even taken into account\\nhow or where the shadow should be.\\n\\nAnd I have three beautiful beach balls to choose from.\\nI think this is probably the more natural one.\\nI'll just go ahead and click Keep and I am done.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2722028\",\"duration\":276,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"The importance of

[Instructor] Let's talk about the importance of selections\\nwhen using Generative Fill in Adobe Firefly.\\nNow I'm starting out here with the exact same image\\nI left the previous exercise with,\\nso basically I kept my file open.\\nNow if you're not really continuing\\nwith the previous project\\nor if you simply accidentally closed your version,\\nthat is absolutely fine.\\nIf you look at the project folder,\\nI have actually saved a version\\nof my iteration of this exercise,\\nready to get started for this specific exercise here.\\n\\nSo if you were in that situation,\\nsimply upload this image into Firefly\\nto get to this same interface.\\nNow, let me show you something very basic.\\nWhat if I want to create or add something specific\\nto the pool itself?\\nNow I'm going to use the insert tool\\nand I'm going to click the brush options\\nand I increase the brush hardness all the way up to 100%.\\nNow what I'm going to do is\\nto, let's say it's something around 90 pixels.\\nLet me just quickly brush a rectangular shape\\nlike so, maybe a little bit higher.\\n\\nNow what I would like to create is a flamingo floaty,\\nactually typed it in beforehand, so it's still there.\\nSo go ahead and type in a flamingo floaty.\\nNow this selection, so in this area,\\nI would like to create the flamingo,\\nbut notice that this is just a normal rectangle.\\nNow if I choose generate, I'm going to get a whole variety\\nof different results.\\nNow, not every floaty will probably look as amazing,\\nI've gone through a few different tests here,\\nsome of them look really good and others look pretty awful.\\n\\nBut notice that I just get a whole variety\\nof different shapes.\\nSo in this area, in this iteration, for example,\\nI have the inflatable head sticking out this way,\\npointing towards the right,\\nhere, it's pointing towards the left,\\nhere, it's more pointing down.\\nI'll click the more options just to show you\\nthree more results and this is going to help you understand\\nthe point I'm trying to make with this exercise.\\nSo let's take a look and see what Firefly gives us now.\\nThis is another one where it's pointing towards the right,\\ntowards the right, backwards, I think.\\n\\nSo basically I have just given Firefly this big rectangle\\nto play with, and inside that region it was free to render\\nand try out every single version of these floaties,\\nthese inflatable flamingos that it wants.\\nNow, I'll just go ahead and hit the cancel option\\nand I'll click reset, which resets the entire interface.\\nNow, I'm going to use the same brush settings, which is 90,\\nand then 100% brush hardness and I'll try and paint\\nthe shape of the flamingo myself.\\n\\nSo I'm just going to start with the base here.\\nSomething like this, for example,\\nI'm not an expert in flamingos, I have to tell you.\\nThere we go.\\nAnd now I'm going to change the settings of the brush.\\nI'm going to press the left bracket on the keyboard\\nto make my brush size a bit smaller, something around 50.\\nI'll just quickly go in here.\\nI'm just going to try and create that head myself.\\nIt looks a little bit like Nessie, the Lochness monster,\\nbut this is absolutely fine.\\n\\nAnd now with this, I'm going to reuse the exact same prompt,\\na flamingo floaty.\\nI'll just go ahead and click generate.\\nAnd so now I've kind of pre-shaped the cookie cutter.\\nSo I've pre-shaped the area in which I'm giving Firefly\\nthe freedom to try and fit something in there.\\nAnd now as you can see, I'm only getting results\\nwhere the flamingo is pointing towards the left.\\nAnd that's exactly what I was hoping for.\\nSo you're kind of forcing Firefly\\nto think within this particular shape\\nand this technique, I'll click more,\\nthis technique allows you to basically\\nkind of sketch out where you want something to appear\\nand what the pose should be.\\n\\nIf you want to generate a dock\\nand the dock should look to the left\\nor should look towards the right,\\nsimply try and draw the outline of that dock\\nin that very specific way\\nand Firefly will accommodate that request\\nand it will render that specific output\\nin that specific way.\\nSo this gives you a tremendous amount of freedom\\nto decide what it is you want to generate and where\\nand how that should manifest in your composition.\\nSo because of that, selections matter.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5942039\",\"duration\":306,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Introducing Generative

[Instructor] Allow me to introduce the final option\\nor final feature here\\nwithin the generative fill technology stack\\nusing Adobe Firefly.\\nI'm starting out here with a familiar scene.\\nThis is the breakfast scene that we worked on before,\\nbut I did go in and made a few additional changes.\\nNow, if you want to use this exact same example,\\nknow that I've supplied this image as a starting point here\\nfor you to upload into Firefly\\nand then follow along with these steps.\\nSo just to give you a couple of ideas,\\nwhat I've done is I've added a bowl of cereal,\\nI've added a spoon,\\nand I've also selected this coffee surface,\\nwhich was a tad boring.\\n\\nIt was just black coffee,\\nand I added latte art just to add this little effect here.\\nNow, the feature I would like to talk about is this one.\\nIt's called expand,\\nor as you know it in Photoshop, generative expand.\\nNow, let me click this third tool here,\\nand this seems to look a little bit like the crop tool\\nin Photoshop, and you would not be mistaken.\\nNow you have a few options available here.\\nNow you can either use the freeform version\\nas you currently see it here, or you can basically go back\\nand use some of these more familiar subjects like landscape,\\nwidescreen, portrait, or square.\\n\\nNow, if you're using free form, you can click\\nthat option again and you can actually type in the values\\nthat you would like to have.\\nNow, for now, I'm not going to type in anything.\\nI'm just going to basically drag these handles myself.\\nBut what does it do?\\nWell, the idea is very simple.\\nYou know that Firefly is capable\\nof generating images from scratch.\\nYou also know that Firefly is capable\\nof inserting more objects into an existing scene,\\nrespecting lighting, shadows and reflections.\\n\\nSo what this specific tool allows you\\nto do is this allows you to crop outward\\nand generate more of that same image.\\nIt can expand the canvas for you\\nby generating more image.\\nNow this process is called out painting,\\nand this is exactly where and how you would use this.\\nSo imagine here that I'm looking\\nfor more breakfast on the right-hand side.\\nI just want to have more room to play with.\\nWell, the only thing I have to do now is just click\\nand drag this handle this way.\\n\\nLet's add somewhat like this much extra space here.\\nAnd if I want, I can always come in and add an extra prompt.\\nNow, my last prompt is still here in the prompt box.\\nI'm going to clearly just go ahead and delete that\\nbefore I hit the generate option.\\nIf I would've left the bowl of serial prompt in here\\nand click generate, it will basically generate serial\\neverywhere, but that's not what I wanted.\\nSo make sure that you have an empty prompt command box\\nbefore you basically command and click generate.\\n\\nNow I think I'm good to go.\\nI'll just quickly go ahead and click generate\\nto start generating extra image.\\nAnd again, I'll get three different iterations of this\\nbecause I have no idea\\nwhat Firefly will be creating for me.\\nNow there's a cutting board here.\\nIt's already done.\\nThere's a cutting board here in the background\\nand some croissants,\\nand it has created more of that cutting board.\\nSo this is one version.\\nThis is another version, and this is another version.\\nAnd I got to say they all look really lifelike.\\n\\nIt has recreated the wood pattern.\\nI've got this tablecloth in the background.\\nI have the depth of field effect.\\nThis is looking pretty darn cool.\\nSo I'm going to go for this one, the middle one.\\nI'll just choose keep.\\nAnd now optionally, I can maybe expand the image upward\\nor downwards or to any sides basically.\\nAnd this is a really cool technique that allows you\\nto take a single graphic\\nand then basically change its aspect ratio,\\nmaking it a landscape version\\nor maybe a very narrow portrait version to accommodate\\nfor these different sizes and social media frames\\nand banners, for example, for emails.\\n\\nSo you can now take one hero image, one central image,\\nand create all these different iterations to accommodate\\nfor all these different aspect ratios that you might need,\\nany social media campaign.\\nNow I'm going to go and just basically add one more thing here\\non the right-hand side.\\nI'll choose the insert tool again.\\nI'm going to increase my brush size,\\nso I'm pressing the right bracket key on the keyboard.\\nI'll just select this area.\\nAnd I think we're missing a bit\\nof fruit on this coming here.\\n\\nHere, I'll type in a bowl of freshly cut fruit.\\nI'm missing an R. I'll hit generate.\\nAnd we're going to add this as the final addition\\nto this specific image.\\nLet's give it a few seconds\\nand see what Firefly does with that.\\nThere we go.\\nIf this is a bowl,\\nit should have the same shadows and reflections.\\nThis is a bit of everything.\\nI think I'm going to go for the very first one.\\nI'll choose keep to keep this version.\\nAnd now I am ready\\nto start continuing my marketing campaign.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5942038\",\"duration\":131,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge\",\"fileName\":\"2118184_en_US_04_07_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":false,\"rawDurationSeconds\":126,\"exerciseFileDisplayText\":\"Exercise Files > Ch04 > 04_07\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"This challenge requires you to add multiple objects to a scene and expand its canvas.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":5477877,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\"(bright music)\\n- [Instructor] It's time for another challenge.\\nAnd for this challenge,\\nyou will be needing everything you learned in this chapter.\\nInserting objects, you'll be changing backgrounds,\\nchanging aspect ratios.\\nI really hope you're going to be enjoying this one.\\nNow let me show you the image I have selected for you\\nto play around with here.\\nThis is our subject.\\nLet's call this man Edward.\\nSo Edward is on vacation\\nand clearly based on this facial expression,\\nhe is over the moon with his trip.\\n\\nHowever, I have no idea where this man is.\\nThe only thing I know is he's wearing sunglasses,\\nand he's wearing one of his favorite shirts.\\nMy suggestion is that we're going to take Edward\\nand we're going to change the circumstances of his vacation,\\nand make this a little bit more wondrous basically.\\nThere are couple of things that you have to do.\\nHere comes the shopping list.\\nFirst of all, I want him to be in a jungle scene,\\nso we have to change the background\\nand this needs to be the jungle.\\n\\nSecondly, we have to make a selection here in this area,\\nbecause I want him to wear a safari hat.\\nAnd there should be a parrot,\\na big red parrot sitting on one of his shoulders.\\nAnd then to finish off,\\nhe should be wearing a wooden necklace.\\nLet's say it's a souvenir from his trip.\\nAnd the very last thing I want you to do,\\nis I want you to change the aspect ratio\\nof this image from landscape to portrait.\\n\\nAnd this means you will have\\nto generate a bit more image here at the bottom.\\nSo just a quick recap, change the background to jungle.\\nGive him a safari hat, wooden necklace.\\nThere should be a parrot on his shoulder,\\nand we have to change the aspect ratio,\\nwhich means go to portrait mode\\nand we might have to generate a bit more image\\nhere at the bottom.\\nGood luck and have fun.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5936257\",\"duration\":287,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Solution\",\"fileName\":\"2118184_en_US_04_08_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"Prompts:\\njungle scene\\nsafari hat\\na parrot\\nwooden beaded necklace\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":false,\"rawDurationSeconds\":288,\"exerciseFileDisplayText\":\"Exercise Files > Ch04 > 04_08\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"This video shows the solution to this chapter's challenge of inserting objects and expanding the canvas.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"IN_PROGRESS\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":15546760,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":null}],\"name\":\"4.

[Instructor] By now, I am convinced\\nthat you have a good understanding\\nof how to use the web version\\nof Adobe Firefly's Generative Fill technology,\\nwhich means that it's now time to see\\nhow you can use that same feature\\nhere directly with an Adobe Photoshop.\\nTo help illustrate this,\\nI have opened up this document, elephant-start.psd,\\nwhich we'll be using in just a few seconds.\\nBut before we get started,\\nI briefly wanted to point out\\nthat I'm currently running the beta version\\nof Adobe's Photoshop,\\nwhich comes with a brand new Adobe Firefly feature set,\\nand these features will be used\\nthroughout this entire chapter.\\n\\nNow you can download the beta version\\ndirectly from the Creative Cloud Desktop app\\nby simply clicking the Creative Cloud icon here on the Mac,\\nand then just going into the Beta apps category\\nand then just clicking to download\\nand install this beta version of Adobe Photoshop.\\nNow, there's also a small chance\\nthat by the time you're taking this course,\\nthat these features have already moved\\ninto the official version of Photoshop.\\nNow, this might all sound a little bit complicated,\\nso I would suggest that you simply go\\nthrough the videos in this chapter,\\nafter which you will know\\nexactly which Photoshop version to use\\nbecause you will notice immediately\\nwhether or not you are missing specific features or buttons.\\n\\nNow, let's get back to our current exercise.\\nI'm going to go back to Photoshop here,\\nand let's get started with this image.\\nNow, here in Photoshop,\\nI have this image of Paris open,\\nand I would like to generate an elephant here\\nin the streets of Paris.\\nNow, to get started,\\nyou simply go ahead here\\nand you choose the Rectangular Marquee tool\\nand you simply click and drag a selection.\\nI'm going to move the selection a little bit like so,\\nand it's important to realize\\nthat the size of your selection\\nis going to help define the size of the elephant,\\nso keep in mind how big an elephant\\nyou really want to generate.\\n\\nNow, with this active selection,\\nthe only thing I have to do\\nis simply click the Generative Fill button,\\nafter which the command prompt will automatically appear.\\nSimply type in your prompt,\\nin this case elephant,\\nand then hit Enter or Return to confirm.\\nNow, after a few seconds,\\nyou will see that I'm going to get not one,\\nbut three different variations of the same prompt,\\nand I'm only using one credit for all three together.\\nAnd it's going to be up to me to decide\\nwhich version I like best.\\n\\nNow, this is the first version of my elephant.\\nI'll click the right pointing arrow\\nto go to the second version,\\nand now this is the third version of the elephant.\\nNow these look pretty good,\\nbut I might actually want to generate\\na few more different renditions.\\nNow, you can do so\\nby simply clicking the Generate option again,\\nor alternatively,\\nyou can take a look here at the Properties panel,\\nwhich will show you the properties\\nof the currently selected generative layer.\\nSo here I can basically see the entire prompt\\nand I can also go through my different variations.\\n\\nNow I'll just go ahead\\nand click the Generate option again\\nto create three more variations of the same prompt.\\nAnd again, you can create as many as you like.\\nSo let's give this a few more seconds\\nand see what Firefly is able to come up with.\\nNow while we're waiting,\\nI also wanted to point out that I absolutely love the fact\\nthat the lighting is coming from the exact same source here\\non the left-hand side.\\nAnd you can see that the fur\\non the elephant's head and the back\\nis also lighting up\\nsimply because it's taking to account\\nwhere the light is coming from\\nand where the shadows should be cast.\\n\\nNow, I kind of like this version I got to say,\\nthis looks pretty cool.\\nAnd again, you just go ahead\\nand pick a different version anytime you like.\\nNow I'm going to go ahead and save this document\\nby choosing File, Save.\\nI want to just quickly point out one little detail.\\nNow, when you start to generate additional versions\\nof this specific generative layer,\\nyou will be adding a lot of data to your Photoshop file.\\nNow, in this instance,\\nI have six different versions of an elephant,\\nbut I'm really only interested in using just this one.\\n\\nHowever, if I take a look here at this document,\\nyou can see that this document, elephant-start,\\nis 37 megabytes.\\nIf I were to go back here\\nand then just delete any of these other variations\\nby simply clicking the trash can icon,\\nlet's get rid of this one,\\nlet's delete this one, delete this one, and those ones,\\nand you simply re-save the file,\\nand you go back to the finder,\\nyou will see that now I only have 29 megabytes.\\nNow, this is a very small generation, I got to say,\\nthis is only a very small canvas,\\nit's a very light document.\\n\\nHowever, if you are creating large generations\\nand large images with many different versions,\\nyou can easily add a few dozen\\nor even a few hundred megabytes to your file,\\nand it's just data sitting there,\\nyou're not even using that.\\nSo when you've made up your mind,\\njust go ahead and delete the versions you don't really want.\\nBut be careful\\nbecause you cannot undo that specific command,\\nwhich means once deleted, it is gone forever,\\nso be careful what you do.\\n\\nBut for now, we just get to sit back\\nand enjoy this really cool image of an elephant\\nwalking through the streets of Paris.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5943031\",\"duration\":417,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Generating

generate an entire image,\\nwhether generative fill,\\nwhich we've just used before in the previous exercise,\\nwill only generate an image based on a selection,\\nand we'll put that in the context of your current project.\\nHere I'm just looking to create a brand new image,\\nand in the previous version of Photoshop,\\nyou had to leave Photoshop\\nand go to the Adobe Firefly webpage\\nto use the functionality there\\nand then copy that image over.\\n\\nNow we no longer have to leave Photoshop\\nbecause now the text-to-image functionality\\nhas been baked in by default here\\ndirectly into Adobe Photoshop.\\nLet me show you how to get started.\\nHere in Photoshop,\\nI have opened up this document, hummingbird-start.psd,\\nand this is just a blank canvas\\nand I am ready to generate a brand new image\\nwithout having to leave Photoshop.\\nNow I can click the Generate image option here,\\nor alternatively you can go here into the Tools pane\\nand simply click this icon,\\nwhich does the exact same thing.\\n\\nLet me click that to get started,\\nand now I can use this popup interface\\nto help create the image I'm looking for.\\nSo here in my case,\\nI'm going to type in the following description,\\na hummingbird flying over a field of flowers.\\nSo this is just a normal prompt as you know it.\\nNow I get to choose a content type as well,\\nso I can choose between art and photo.\\nI'm going to go for photo for this one.\\nLet's click that.\\nAnd now I have a few additional options.\\n\\nNow I can use the gallery here on the right-hand side\\njust to discover a few example prompts,\\nbut I'm actually quite happy\\nwith what it is I typed in already.\\nSo photo is good for now,\\nand I do want to use a couple of effects.\\nI'll click the Effects option and I'm going to select a couple.\\nI would love to have a digital art effect,\\nand I'm also going to click\\nthe hyperrealistic effect I have here.\\nSo I'm currently adding two effects in total.\\nNow, I'm not using a reference image at this stage here,\\nbut know that when you click that reference image option,\\nthen you will have access to the same reference images\\nin the match style functionality\\nthat you've learned before on the Firefly webpage.\\n\\nI'll just quickly just click the left pointing arrow\\njust to go back to the main page.\\nSo now I am ready to get started.\\nI have my prompt, I have my content type and two effects.\\nI'll go ahead and click Generate\\nand I'll wait for the result to come in.\\nNow while we're waiting,\\nI do want to point out something that's quite important,\\nbut not everyone realizes this at the same time.\\nNow, when you create an image using Firefly on the web,\\nit's always using the square aspect ratio by default.\\n\\nAnd I have the ability to change\\nan aspect ratio to any of these presets.\\nFor example, I can have a wide screen version,\\nI can have a portrait version, et cetera.\\nHowever, here in this version in Photoshop,\\nPhotoshop is going to fill the canvas with that image,\\nwhich means that I can start out with a canvas size\\nthat might be a bit weird, it might be a very small canvas,\\nit might be very wide or a very high canvas.\\nIt's always going to fill the entire canvas,\\nwhich I got to say is pretty unique\\nto this Photoshop experience.\\n\\nNow the images come in now\\nand I'm looking at the very first result.\\nThis is one version,\\nI got to say it looks absolutely stunning.\\nLet me quickly take a look at the second version,\\nand this is the third version.\\nNow, when this version is created,\\nit will automatically create a generative layer here\\non the right-hand side,\\nwhich means I now have access\\nto the same options that you saw\\nbefore in the previous exercise.\\nNow, there is one difference here, however,\\nand that is this little icon that was now added,\\nwhich is the effects and the style options.\\n\\nSo if you were to click that,\\nyou can actually go back and revisit\\nsome of the effects that you applied before.\\nSo this allows you to switch this prompt from photo to art\\nor simply change the type of effects\\nthat you would like to see in this prompt result.\\nSo nothing you're doing is actually set in stone.\\nYou can always go back and you can numb destructively,\\nchange different effects\\nor change different content types as you see fit.\\nNow I'm just going to go ahead and zoom in a little bit here\\njust to inspect some of the details here on this bird.\\n\\nNow this image looks absolutely beautiful,\\nbut there's one more thing that you can do.\\nNow, if you look at some of these results,\\nyou can actually just click the ellipsis icon,\\nand from here you can choose\\nto create similar looking images.\\nNow the Generate similar option\\nis something that should ring a bell\\nif you went through the previous chapters.\\nChoosing Generate similar\\nis going to go ahead and base new prompts\\non this input directly.\\nSo if I basically click the ellipses\\nand choose Generate similar,\\nit's going to go ahead and create three additional versions\\nof this prompt based on this image as its main input,\\nand you can kind of go deeper and deeper\\ninto these versions,\\nbasing one version on another.\\n\\nSo now what it's done is taken into account\\nthe color of the flowers,\\nsome of the sunshine in the background here.\\nAnd now I'm looking at images that look visually similar.\\nNow this is simply how you can go ahead and generate images,\\nbut there's one more thing I do want to point out,\\nand that is resolution.\\nNow at the time of this recording\\nusing Firefly version three,\\nthe maximum resolution that you can get from an image\\nis 2048 pixels by 2048 pixels.\\n\\nAnything that is larger than that is going to look upscaled\\nand might appear a little bit pixelated.\\nNow, if I look at the file dimensions\\nfrom this specific document by going into Image\\nand then Image Size,\\nI can see that I am within those boundaries of 2048 pixels,\\nwhich means that the resolution I'm seeing here\\nis exactly what Firefly can give me.\\nBut if I started out with a document\\nthat measures, for example, 4,000 by 6,000 pixels,\\nthen the end result might not look that great\\nbecause Firefly will generate an image\\nthat measures a maximum of 2048,\\nand it will then upscale that\\nto match the current canvas size.\\n\\nSo keep that in mind when you're generating images\\nthat the resolution might sometimes look a little bit off\\nsimply

[Instructor] Another cool and unique feature\\nthat we can find here in the beta version of Adobe Photoshop\\nis the ability to generate a background\\nfor a layer here directly in Photoshop.\\nNow, let's do a quick recap.\\nNow, in the previous videos,\\nI've shown you how to use gender fill,\\nwhich allows you to make a selection of an image\\nand then use a prompt to insert an object into the scene.\\nNow, secondly, we've used text to image,\\nwhich allows you to create a whole new image altogether.\\n\\nAnd now we'll be generating a new background.\\nWell, what's the difference?\\nThe difference is that the generate background functionality\\nallows you to build a unique object composition based\\non a subject.\\nLet me show you how that works.\\nI'm here in Photoshop, where I'm using photoshootstart.psd.\\nAnd this is a pink purse that is just sitting\\non a flat white background.\\nNow, I want to use the generate background functionality,\\nbut the problem is,\\nI don't really see that functionality anywhere here.\\n\\nNow, the trick is the following:\\nYou first have to click this button called\\nremove background.\\nLet's go ahead and click that which is going to use AI\\nto detect and then kick out the background\\nby adding a layer mask here to the layer,\\nand only then will you see this button\\nthat says generate background.\\nNow when you click generate background,\\nit's going to ask me what the environment\\nis where I would like to put this purse.\\nSo let's quickly make this very simple.\\nI'll type in something like a marble table in a living room.\\n\\nI'll just go ahead and hit enter or return,\\nafter which it's going to take into account the shape\\nof the object.\\nIt will try and detect what the object actually is,\\nand it will generate that background for you.\\nNow, this is different from just using text to image,\\nbecause now it's really taking into account the scale\\nof the object and also how it's being positioned.\\nNow, this is the first version I now have.\\nLet's take a look at the second version\\nand the third version.\\nSo there's a couple things that I do want to point out.\\n\\nNow, first of all, the perspective seems to match,\\nwhich is really great.\\nBut more importantly,\\nlook at some of these details.\\nIt's actually generating a shadow here at the bottom\\nof this purse.\\nWe didn't have that shadow when we started.\\nIt decided that a shadow is required if the bag\\nis positioned in that specific location here.\\nAnd then lastly,\\nI actually have a reflection being cast\\non the marble table as well.\\nSo, this functionality really helps you\\nto create these different image compositions\\nby simply kicking out the background,\\nand then choosing the option\\nto create a brand-new background.\\n\\nLet me show you one more version here\\nwhere I actually cleaned up the selection a little bit more\\nand I put this here on a park bench.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5941029\",\"duration\":208,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using Generative

[Instructor] Let me show you how you can use\\ngenerative expand directly within Adobe Photoshop.\\nTo get started, simply open up koala-start.psd\\nand then switch to the crop tool to initiate this process.\\nNow, before you do anything, it's important to realize\\nthat Photoshop has three different methods\\nof cropping images.\\nSo if you go to the top of the screen,\\nbe sure to change the fill option\\nfrom transparent to generative expand.\\nNow I'm going to take a step back by zooming out\\nby pressing command minus or CTRL minus on Windows,\\nand then simply choose the ratio that you want to use.\\n\\nNow if you don't want to use\\nany of these specific ratios here,\\nsimply use these sliders and drag any of these handles\\nto simply expand the image.\\nSo here in this example,\\nI'm going to go ahead and just expand this downward,\\nmaybe a bit like so,\\nso I'm adding about a third of the image,\\nand then simply hit generate option\\nwithout entering a specific prompt.\\nI'll go ahead and click generate\\nand then I'll wait for Firefly to do its thing.\\nNow, expanding images this way\\nis basically just adding more canvas to your current project\\nand then filling up that canvas\\nwith the generative fill command,\\nwhich means that this will create a new generative layer\\nand it will give you more options here\\ndirectly within the properties panel,\\nwhich means that I don't have one version,\\nbut I have two, three versions to choose from.\\n\\nAnd looking at this version here,\\nespecially the first and the second one,\\nI got to say, this looks pretty darn cool.\\nSo it actually detected that this is a koala\\nand it added some of the paws here\\non the right hand side of the image.\\nAnd this looks really, really good.\\nLet's look at another example.\\nLet's go back to the project folder.\\nI'm going to open up landscape-start and let's get started.\\nNow, same thing here.\\nThis is an image where I'm not quite sure\\nwhat's happening here in the background,\\nand I just need to generate more of that image.\\n\\nI'm going to zoom out a little bit by pressing command minus\\nor CTRL minus on Windows,\\nand I currently still have the crop tool selected.\\nNow this time I'm going to make sure\\nthat I'm going to choose a different ratio,\\nand I'll switch the ratio here,\\nand I'm going to choose something like 16x9.\\nAnd I'm going to come in here\\nand then drag this top corner to the top left,\\nsomething like this.\\nI'll go ahead and choose Generate\\nto add more to this current composition.\\nSo I'm allowing Firefly to choose\\nwhat these windows actually look like\\nand what is happening here on the left hand side\\nof this specific scene.\\n\\nLet's give it a few more seconds\\nto come up with three different examples.\\nAnd there we have it.\\nSo here in this version, it shows rounds or arched windows.\\nAnd let's take a look at another version.\\nThis is another version here, second and third one.\\nYou know what I think I'm going to go for\\nthis one specifically.\\nNow, obviously, if you want to generate more versions,\\nyou simply go ahead and click the generate option again,\\nafter which Firefly will give you\\nmore versions to choose from.\\nNow, optionally, you can also just click\\nthis little button here,\\nwhich allows you to enhance the detail of this image\\nby clicking this option now\\nand then waiting for this version to come in.\\n\\nSo now the resolution is going to be slightly better\\ncompared to what you had before.\\nAnd there you have it.\\nThis is how simple it is to use generative expand\\ndirectly within Adobe

[Instructor] Let's take a moment to talk about something\\nthat nobody really likes to talk about,\\nwhich is limitations.\\nUp until now, we've only talked about how amazing Firefly\\nis and the quality of the images,\\ntips and tricks, how to get the best out of your prompt.\\nBut it's important to know where the technology is today.\\nAnd so I've already mentioned\\nthat at the time of this recording,\\nthe maximum resolution you can get\\nout of Adobe Firefly using Version 3\\nis 2,048 pixels by 2,048 pixels.\\n\\nNow, anything that goes\\nabove that number in a single prompt\\nwill look pixelated.\\nLet me show you an example\\nwhere that might seem very, very clear.\\nSo here in Photoshop, I currently have this document open,\\nit's called limitations.psd.\\nAnd before we do anything,\\nlet's take a look at the image dimensions.\\nI'll just go ahead and choose Image.\\nI'll choose Image Size.\\nAnd so, this document measures almost 10,000 pixels\\nby roughly 5 1/2 1,000 pixels.\\n\\nThat's a lot of pixels.\\nNow, let's go ahead and click Cancel for now.\\nAnd let's take a look at something\\nthat we would want to do using Firefly.\\nSo I have expanded the canvas downwards\\nand now I would like to generate more content in this area.\\nNow, you can do this\\nby either using Generative Expand\\nor by using Generative Fill.\\nThe principle is the same.\\nI have a very large body of pixels\\nthat I would like to fill using generative AI technology\\nfueled by Adobe Firefly.\\nSo what I could do is the following.\\n\\nI could potentially just take my Rectangular Marquee tool,\\nI can just go ahead and just click\\nand drag a very big selection\\nthat covers this empty area,\\nand it's also slightly overlapping the area\\nof the known content.\\nThat's a pretty good practice, by the way.\\nAnd now with nothing selected,\\nI'll just go ahead and click Generative Fill\\nand then click Generate again without a prompt,\\nwhich means fill this up with more content,\\nwhich is exactly what Generative Expand usually does.\\n\\nI'll to go ahead and click Generate.\\nAnd now I'm asking Firefly to generate\\n5 1/2 1,000 pixels in width.\\nAnd then, I'm guessing 1,500 pixels in height?\\nI'm not quite sure.\\nAnyway, there are a lot of pixels.\\nLet's give it a few seconds.\\nNow, it's done generating\\neverything and you think to yourself,\\nwow, that looks absolutely stunning.\\nThis is the first version, second version, third version,\\nso you've got different variations.\\nLet's go for the first one.\\n\\nNow, I'm going to zoom in a little bit\\nby choosing the Zoom tool like so,\\nand I am going to just pan a little bit\\ndownward and notice this.\\nDo you notice a transition that goes from this area\\nof the image that seems to have a lot more detail\\nto the bottom, which is, looks a bit like a soup basically.\\nSo this is something that becomes very, very clear\\nthe moment you start to zoom in\\nor the moment you start to look at this image\\nin actual size.\\n\\nNow, the reason this looks, well, this bad,\\nis simply because we have surpassed Firefly's limits\\nby requesting too many pixels at the same time.\\nSo what do you do?\\nWell, we can wait for the next version\\nof Firefly to come out\\nand address the number of pixels being generated,\\nbut for now,\\nI do have to make sure I have a decent-looking project,\\nso we have an alternative way of working\\nand we can use a workaround.\\nNow, let me show you how that works.\\n\\nI'm going to go ahead and just delete this later.\\nAnd instead, we're going to be choosing\\nthe Marquee Selection tool again.\\nAnd I'm going to change this option\\nfrom Style to Fixed Size.\\nNow, remember,\\nthe maximum that we can generate\\nin actual resolution is 2,048 pixels by 2,048,\\nlet's just say roughly 2,000 pixels in either direction.\\nAnd so, I set this up by using that maximum of 2,000 pixels.\\nSo I'm setting the limitation here\\nas to how many pixels I can generate at a time.\\n\\nI'll simply click to generate that selection,\\nwhich now measures 2,000 by 2,000 pixels.\\nAnd I'll position this here in the bottom-left corner,\\nsomething like so, maybe a bit lower\\nbecause I don't need that much in height.\\nAnd with that current selection,\\nsimply click Generative Fill, and then click Generate again,\\nafter which Firefly will start to expand the image.\\nNow, not fully, but only within this big 2,000 pixel\\nsquare frame that I have.\\n\\nNow, let's give it a couple of seconds here and now,\\nthis is what the result looks like.\\nAnd if I were to zoom into the result,\\nyou will see that now I don't have this awkward transition\\ngoing from good quality to meh quality.\\nAnd so, now I have leveraged the full potential,\\nthe full quality potential still, of Firefly.\\nNow, how do you keep going?\\nSimple.\\nYou simply fill more.\\nLet's go back to the Selection Marquee tool.\\nLet's place our next selection.\\nBe sure there's a bit of overlap on every side.\\n\\nClick Gen Fill again and again,\\nand you keep adding to this image\\ntime after time, like you're building little tiles,\\nand you just do one generation command at a time.\\nAnd that way, you still have the ability\\nto fill a very large area with data,\\nnot surpassing the available quality, using Adobe Firefly.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5936255\",\"duration\":333,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using a reference

[Instructor] If you've gone through\\nall the previous chapters in this course,\\nthen I'm absolutely convinced\\nthat you came across this image.\\nWe named this person Edward,\\nand Edward just came back from safari.\\nNow, unfortunately for him, summer's over, vacation is over,\\nand it's time to head into winter,\\nwhich means it's time for Edward\\nto put on a warm winter coat,\\nand I know exactly which one.\\na warm winter coat, and I know exactly which one.\\nIf you look at the project folder,\\nthere's this image called reference.jpg,\\nand this is what the image looks like.\\n\\nIt's just a normal yellow winter coat.\\nUnfortunately, if I'm using Firefly,\\nit just keeps generating all\\nsorts of different winter coats,\\nand it's not really using the one that I have envisioned.\\nAnd this is where we can start\\nto use reference images directly\\nwithin Adobe Photoshop Beta.\\nLet me show you how that works.\\nI'll just go ahead and close this preview,\\nand let's go back into Photoshop.\\nNow, everything starts with a selection,\\nand it's really important that, for this selection,\\nthat you make a selection based on the outline of the coat\\nthat this person should be wearing.\\n\\nIn other words, don't base your selection\\non the current outfit,\\nbase your selection on the outfit\\nthat you want this person to wear.\\nFor example, if I want to put in a coat in this image\\nand this coat has a hoodie,\\nthen I have to make sure that I include space\\nfor that hoodie as part of my selection.\\nLet me show you how that works.\\nI'm going to use the lasso tool,\\nand I'm going to start my selection here\\nsomewhere underneath his chin.\\nI'm going to start dragging towards his neck.\\n\\nI'm going to go up,\\nand I'm going to make a round motion like this just\\nto accommodate for that extra space\\nto generate a hoodie as part of my winter coat.\\nAnd now I'm just going to free form over the current shirt.\\nI'm going to go all the way down towards the left\\nand now go back up like so.\\nNow it's a thick winter coat,\\nso it's normal I don't stay this close to his actual arms,\\nand when I get to the shoulder same thing go up,\\nmake a big of a bump and then go down across the cheek line\\nand then make a connection.\\n\\nSo, this is roughly the type of selection\\nthat I would like to have,\\nand then within this shape, I would like to generate a coat.\\nNow if you have gone across this line here, for example,\\nthis is cutting it really close here,\\nyou can always press and hold on the shift key\\nand then simply drag to include another area like so\\nwithin your current selection.\\nNow refining the selection is really important,\\nso I suggest you take your time to start to add\\nand subtract and just basically sculpt that selection.\\n\\nNow, the moment you're ready,\\nit's time to hit that gen to fill button.\\nClick gen to fill and type in\\na yellow winter coat.\\nBefore you hit enter or return,\\nclick this icon that says reference image.\\nClick that and then click the choose image option,\\nand then go ahead and select reference.jpg,\\nwhich you can find in the project folder.\\nFrom there, click open and then choose generate\\nto take the reference image into account as a source,\\nand then generate the prompt using a combination.\\n\\nNow you can already see that the reference image\\nis also being used here in the properties panel,\\nand you can always go back\\nand change reference images if you like.\\nAnd there we go.\\nThis is the first version of our render.\\nLet's take a look at the second version\\nand the third version.\\nAnd you can clearly see that,\\nbecause we basically included some area here\\nin the back of the neck,\\nthat Firefly has taken this into account\\nand has really added this area of the coat.\\nIt would never have done\\nthat if you simply followed the neck\\nand the shoulder line from the get-go.\\n\\nAnd now it's just a matter of refining as you see fit.\\nFor example, if you don't really like the zipper\\nthat was put in here, you can always\\ngo back and replace that zipper.\\nSo you can, for example,\\njust use the lasso tool just to go all the way down,\\nand then you go back up just to quickly highlight this area.\\nThere we go.\\nLet's click gen to fill.\\nAnd let's type in zipper.\\nAnd I'll hit Enter or Return.\\nThat is going to generate a second layer\\non top of the first one.\\n\\nAnd it's going to make sure\\nthat it's going to be generating three different variations\\nof a zipper.\\nI'm really hoping I'm going to find something\\nI really like because I don't really like the version\\nthat was generated here from scratch.\\nThis looks a bit better.\\nLet's try the second version even better.\\nAnd I think I'm going to go for this one here.\\nSo I now have two separate layers.\\nSo I have the zipper and I have the yellow winter coat,\\nwhich is using a reference image,\\nwhich you can always revisit as you see fit.\\nBut keep in mind that the reference image\\non its own is never enough.\\n\\nYou always have to make sure that you have a prompt\\nthat will make sure that the generation\\nof the contents will match the style\\nof what you have here in the reference image.\\nAnd now you can see that we just made\\na very impactful change in this image,\\nwhich I think otherwise would have probably taken me\\na couple of hours to finish in a photorealistic way.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5941028\",\"duration\":95,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge:

upbeat music)\\n- [Instructor] Let's take a look\\nat the solution to this specific challenge.\\nNow, first of all, we had to create\\na backpack for this individual and for this,\\nI need to create a selection.\\nSo I've gone ahead and I've selected\\nthe rectangular marquee tool.\\nBut be careful because if you went through\\nthe previous exercises,\\nthere's a chance that this tool is still set up here\\nas a fixed size selection measuring 2000 by 2000 pixels.\\n\\nSo go back to normal to get started.\\nThen simply drag a rectangular selection\\nacross this person's back like so,\\nand then type in, \\\"backpack\\\"\\nand then hit Enter or Return\\nto look at some of these results.\\nAgain, you can choose any backpack you like best.\\nThis is more about the principle obviously.\\nLet's give it a few more seconds\\nand watch these suggestions come in, almost there.\\nThere we go.\\n\\nThis is the first version, looking pretty good.\\nSecond version, third version.\\nPick the one you like best.\\nI think I'll go for the second one.\\nThere we go.\\nNext up, I want to create a river\\nthat runs through this landscape.\\nAnd again, you have a couple of options.\\nYou could potentially use something like the lasso tool\\nto draw out the shape of the river.\\nSo you get to decide which course the river is taking\\nand where the flow is headed.\\nOr you can basically just use\\nthe same rectangular marquee tool\\nand just select a larger area like so.\\n\\nAnd then simply click gen fill and type in, \\\"river\\\",\\nand then hit Enter or Return.\\nThis is going to give Firefly a little bit of freedom\\nto wiggle the river through this selection,\\nbecause you're giving it more room to play with.\\nNow if I had gone for the lasso tool,\\nI could have kind of molded\\nthe shape of that river throughout the landscape.\\nThis is the first version,\\nsecond version looking a lot better by the way.\\nAnd a third version, I think I'm going to go for this one.\\nI kind of like the color of the water here.\\n\\nNow let's add a setting sun.\\nLet's add another selection here, something like that.\\nI do want to make it big enough\\nbecause there might be a bit of glow coming from that sun,\\nand I'll position it somewhere around here.\\nI'll choose Generate fill again\\nand I'll type in \\\"setting sun\\\", hit Enter or Return,\\nand then again, watch these results come in.\\nNow if you're not getting a results\\nby simply typing in \\\"setting sun\\\",\\nyou can type in something like large sun,\\nor small, or bright, or yellow, or orange, or desert sun.\\n\\nYou have many different variations\\nif you kind of think about\\nwhat it is that you want to achieve.\\nFor now, it has really taken to account\\nthat the sun is setting.\\nSo it has really looked at different versions here.\\nHere it's kind of tiny and hidden behind the clouds.\\nHere it's really kind of touching the edge of the hill.\\nAnd here I have a very large sum.\\nThis is a bit dramatic, I got to say.\\nSo I'm going to go for this one.\\nI think this is probably the most realistic one.\\nAnd now lastly, I had to expand the canvas, remember.\\nSo I'm going to go ahead here.\\n\\nI'll choose the crop tool and I'm going to make sure\\nthat this option is set to generative expand.\\nAnd I'll just go ahead\\nand I'll just try and expand this a bit like so.\\nSo I have about a third of extra space.\\nI'll choose Generate to start adding that extra room\\njust outside of this canvas.\\nThat gives a few more seconds\\nand I'm quite curious to see which area\\nFirefly is going to come up with.\\nSometimes you might get extra rock,\\nsometimes you might get a bit of grass.\\n\\nIt kind of depends I guess, what kind of mood Firefly's in.\\nOkay, big Cliff, apparently.\\nBig Cliff.\\nSecond version, more cliffs.\\nThird version, I think I like this one best.\\nI like how this area kind of bleeds into the forest\\nyou see here in the background.\\nNow keep in mind that if you do want to get\\na bit of a higher resolution for this specific rendition,\\nyou can always try and hover\\nand then click this area to go ahead\\nand then enhance the detail and see if that works.\\nSo this is something I just done.\\n\\nThis is after, and this is before.\\nSee, I'm just pressing Command + Z\\nor Shift + Command + Z, going back and forth.\\nThis is again, after, before.\\nIt does really add something to the resolution.\\nSo there we go.\\nI think this looks pretty cool.\\nSo this is the version we started out with\\nand this is the version we're ending with.\\nAgain, just five minutes or maybe less.\\nAnd then we have a completely different rendition\\nof the same graphic.\\nI hope you really enjoyed this challenge, I know I did.\\n\\nAnd I got to say, these results\\nare always spectacular looking.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"5.

some of these options already.\\n\\nNow, I do have to admit\\nthat they're all in a different location,\\nbut the principle is absolutely the same.\\nNow it's using Firefly in the background\\nto quickly generate this image for me,\\nwhich will then act as the background.\\nI'm going to go ahead and maybe click the second one.\\nI think that's a slightly better version.\\nI'm just going to go ahead here,\\nplace this in the top-left corner.\\nNow I'll just drag out this corner\\njust to scale this image until it fills the entire screen.\\nNow it's time to add some text.\\nI'm going to go ahead and click the Text tool here\\nand I'll click Add your text.\\n\\nAnd now I'll just go ahead\\nand type in the word Pirates, like so.\\nAnd then we have to change the font.\\nNow, I am looking for a font\\nthat kind of matches the pirate theme\\nthat I'm looking for here.\\nSo just go ahead and select the text by double clicking it\\nand then look at the available fonts here\\nin the list of Adobe Fonts.\\nSo I'm going to take a look here, and I recently used this one.\\nIt's called Alexander Quill Regular.\\nAnd I think this one\\nkind of captures the vibe I'm looking for here.\\n\\nI'm going to make this a bit bigger like so,\\nand I'm going to drag this and center this here.\\nDon't worry about the color\\nbecause the text effect is going to cover up\\nall the color you have in the font.\\nSo this has nothing to do with the effect itself.\\nNow, when you're ready\\nselecting and creating your text,\\nsimply scroll down the list\\nof options and then choose Text effects.\\nFrom here, I can choose what type of texture\\nI would like to apply to my text.\\n\\nSo let's start describing a texture.\\nNow, I'm going to try something specific.\\nFor example, drift wood.\\nNow, I do have a few additional options available,\\nbut for now, don't touch anything.\\nSimply go ahead\\nand click Generate to create a text effect\\nthat matches that texture.\\nNow, if you scroll down a little bit here,\\nyou'll notice that Firefly\\nis now generating four different versions\\nof that driftwood.\\nAnd I got to say, looking at these results,\\nthis is something that would be very difficult\\nto achieve using Photoshop,\\nor at least, it will cost you a lot of time\\nand many stock images of driftwood.\\n\\nI'm going to choose this one,\\njust to inspect and see what that does.\\nThis is looking not too shabby.\\nThis is not too bad.\\nMaybe try this one.\\nActually, let's go for this one.\\nLet's see if this one's a bit better.\\nSo anyway, just go ahead\\nand choose the version you like best.\\nIf you want to see more different versions of this text,\\nsimply click the Show or Load more option here,\\nand it's going to basically come in\\nand generate more of that content.\\nNow, you can actually scale this up and down.\\nAnd the beautiful thing about this technology\\nis the fact that this is all still editable.\\n\\nYou can always come in here and edit the text.\\nYou can even go back here\\nby clicking the left-pointing arrow\\nand change the font after the fact,\\nwhich means that this effect,\\nthe text effect, will be reapplied to the same text,\\nwhich is kind of cool.\\nNow, there are a few more options available here,\\nincluding the style\\nand how tight you want the effect to wrap around the text.\\nBut we'll look at these options in the next video\\nwhen we create a new project.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5942037\",\"duration\":266,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Setting additional text

then we added a text called Pirates,\\nand then we gave that a driftwood effect.\\nNow let's change this project just a little bit\\njust to show you guys a few more additional options.\\nNow, first of all, I'm going to come in here\\nand just double click this text\\nand I'm going to type in a different text.\\nI'm going to type in, capitalized, \\\"ICE COLD,\\\"\\nand I'm just going to reduce the size of this font,\\nmaybe let's say something around maybe 400\\njust to make sure it does fit the screen.\\n\\nThere we go.\\nAnd I'm also going to go ahead and choose a different font.\\nNow I'm looking for a font that's quite thick,\\nlike I also used this one recently.\\nIt's called Anton Regular.\\nI'm going to apply this one\\nand I'm going to give this a few seconds just to load it.\\nMy text effect is still active,\\nso now it is re-rendering this type, using a different font.\\nIt looks good still, I have to say,\\nbut I'm looking for a different type of text effect.\\nNow let's select this element, go back to text effects,\\nand let's change this sample itself.\\n\\nNow if you want, you can always take a look\\nat some of these presets by clicking view all,\\nand from here, you can actually take a look\\nat some of the examples\\nthat basically ship with Adobe Express.\\nNow there's a chunky knit, blueberries, almonds,\\nthere's a lot of different things in here,\\nso you can really go crazy and be very, very creative\\nif you look at these simple examples.\\nWell, there are a lot of them, I have to say.\\nThey must have added a few recently.\\nNow let's choose one of ourselves here.\\n\\nI'm going to go back\\nI'm going to type in something like, \\\"Ice.\\\"\\nI'll click generate and I will wait a few seconds\\nfor this to generate in the background.\\nSo obviously, the idea is to basically freeze these letters.\\nAnd what I'm also going to do\\nis I'm going to change the text customization option\\nfrom medium to loose.\\nI'm going to go ahead and click generate.\\nSo this is basically going to expand the effect\\na little bit, making some of the edges\\na bit more chunky around the edges.\\n\\nSo this is basically going to allow me\\nto have more variation in the text itself.\\nNow you can see there's actually\\na couple of harsh edges here,\\non the left hand side of the I.\\nAnd just having this rougher version of this effect\\nis something that's very typical\\nwhen you are using the loose setting here.\\nAnd the only thing that's left for me to do now\\nis just to select this background image,\\nclick text to image and change the prompt.\\nFor example, I'll just call this one,\\n\\\"Close up of white snow,\\\" and I'll just hit generate\\njust to refresh this image in the background\\nso it can actually form a better hole.\\n\\nNow keep in mind that every single thing you make here\\ninside of Express, by default, stays within Express.\\nSo these are all Express projects,\\nand you can play around with this as much as you want,\\nbut there might be a time\\nwhen you want to take something\\nout of Express into Photoshop.\\nNow, there are a few ways to go about this.\\nSo for example, what you can do is\\nyou can select elements and then you can try\\nand save them as separate files, for example,\\nbut if you're just absolutely sure\\nthat you want to take just one element,\\nlike the text out of Express and into Photoshop,\\nthe best way to do this would be to download this\\nas a transparent file.\\n\\nSo how do you do this?\\nWell, I would suggest you, first of all,\\ndelete the image in the background\\nand then make sure you click the background color option\\nand then click this option\\nthat will set this to transparent.\\nNow, make sure that this effect is big enough,\\nso I like to scale this up a bit more.\\nThere we go.\\nAnd then when you're done, simply click the download option,\\nand then it says, \\\"Transparent, PNG,\\\"\\nand it will only say, \\\"Transparent\\\"\\nthe moment we have a transparent background.\\n\\nSo if you don't see that word here, \\\"Transparent,\\\"\\nthat should be a signal for you to go back\\nand actually change the background.\\nSo when you download this here from Adobe Express,\\nyou can then import that into Adobe Photoshop\\nand then apply that to your current composition.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5936254\",\"duration\":256,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating design templates with Text to

click Generate,\\nand now, I will give Express a couple of seconds\\nto come up with four different designs.\\nNow, this tends to take a little bit longer, I have to say,\\nbut it kind of makes sense,\\nbecause Express is not just creating images\\nor anything like that.\\nIt is creating an actual template with working elements,\\ndecorative elements, art, geometry, effects.\\n\\nIt's going to be placing images, it's going to be making up text,\\nand it basically has to bring everything together.\\nSo, let's look at a few very subtle things here\\nin these first four results.\\nNow, first of all, it actually came up with a lot of text,\\nso, this one actually says, \\\"Nippon Nights,\\\"\\nso, it named my film festival,\\nand it says, \\\"A celebration of Japanese cinema,\\\"\\nand apparently, it is brought to you\\nby the Japan Embassy in Berlin, which is quite interesting.\\n\\nLet's look at this one here.\\nIt says \\\"Berlin, Germany,\\\"\\nand then it says, \\\"Japanese Cinema Celebration,\\nfree admission,\\\"\\nand then there's an image here in the background, as well.\\nThere's one over here that says, \\\"Discover Japanese Cinema.\\\"\\nThere is a line that says, \\\"Follow us @JFFBerlin\\nfor updates and more,\\\"\\nand then there's this version here.\\nAgain, I have a whole variety of different things.\\nSo, let's say, you want to run with one\\nof these different designs here.\\nSo, you can always hover over this design\\nand then click See Variations,\\nand it's a bit like the option to Create Similar\\nwhen you're using text images in Firefly.\\n\\nIt's going to take that as your input,\\nand try and create different variations\\nbased on the version that I clicked before.\\nAnd it's actually quite astounding\\nthat Express didn't just find Japanese-themed images.\\nIt basically made an invitation.\\nIt came up with an organizer name,\\nit came up with different slogans, for example,\\n\\\"Japanese Cinema Nights,\\\" \\\"Japanese Reel,\\\"\\n\\\"Japanese cinema.\\\"\\nSo, I have different variations here,\\nand I got to say, I really like these images.\\n\\nThey're actually quite cool.\\nLet me go for this one here.\\nI'm going to go ahead and click this one,\\nand then it's going to really open that up here\\ninside of Adobe Express.\\nSo now, my template is getting ready,\\nand every single element that you see here,\\nI can click this, and I can actually take a look\\nat these various options.\\nAll the texts I see here is actually live,\\nso, I can go ahead and make a change to that.\\nI can add animations, videos, and everything else.\\nSo, just specifying all this information\\nabout what is you're looking for as in a poster,\\na location, a time, and everything else\\nis

[Instructor] Adobe Firefly is so versatile,\\nit even has the ability to generate vector graphics\\nfrom scratch directly from within Adobe Illustrator.\\nThis feature is called Text to Vector Graphic,\\nand it is just as mind-boggling as it is easy to use.\\nNow in this first video,\\nI will give you a brief introduction\\nto this feature directly from within Adobe Illustrator\\nsimply because of the fact that\\nat the time of this recording,\\nthis feature is not yet available\\nvia the Adobe Firefly webpage.\\nNow the principle is similar\\nto the Text to Image functionality\\nwhere you simply type in the prompt\\nand then let Firefly generate that artwork for you.\\n\\nSo let's take a look at a very simple example.\\nSo I'm here inside of Adobe Illustrator\\nwhere I have opened up scenestart.ai,\\nwhich is a very basic document\\nthat you can find in the Project folder.\\nAnd I'm going to use this document\\njust to demonstrate just how this feature works.\\nNow here on the right-hand side,\\nyou have the Properties panel\\nwhere you have the Text to Vector Graphic interface.\\nAnd so we have a whole bunch of options available here\\nbecause this goes up from the top of the screen here\\nin the interface all the way to this area here.\\n\\nSo it is taking up a lot of space in the interface.\\nNow if you do want to split your options a little bit,\\nI do suggest you click this little ellipsis icon here\\njust to split this into a separate floating panel,\\nand then that will give you the possibility to switch\\nto other properties as you start to draw\\nand create additional artwork.\\nNow let's go through the basics here.\\nThere are four types of subjects\\nthat you can basically choose from.\\nThere is a scene.\\n\\nYou can create seamless patterns.\\nYou can create icons, and you can create subjects.\\nNow this will basically change\\nwhat type of artwork you will be creating,\\nand you can actually see that both the settings\\nand the sample prompts give you a good idea\\nof what that actually looks like.\\nFor example, let's try a scene to get started.\\nI'm going to go ahead and try any of these sample prompts here\\nthat ship with Adobe Illustrator.\\nI'm just going to go ahead and click this one.\\nAnd this is the first iteration.\\n\\nIt says, \\\"Magical Campfire, around tents,\\nminimal, cool winter, night colors.\\\"\\nSo it's going to take its time\\nto generate three separate designs for me,\\njust like it did with Adobe Firefly on the web.\\nAnd it's going to give me the very first one.\\nNow this is the first iteration, this is the second one,\\nand this is the third one.\\nNow you have this bar here at the bottom of your result,\\njust like you have inside of Adobe Photoshop,\\nwhere you have the ability to simply click the left\\nand right arrow to quickly cycle\\nthrough these different results.\\n\\nNow I'm going to go ahead and just select the third one.\\nI'm going to place this here in this corner.\\nI'm going to hold on the Shift key\\nand click and drag out this corner\\nso it fills the right-hand side of my artboard,\\nand this is the result I currently have.\\nNow what's interesting is that you can actually come in,\\nand you can change various settings,\\nfor example, the amount of detail that you have\\nin the vector graphics.\\nYou can also play around with different things,\\nlike, for example, what kind of style it should be using.\\n\\nNow let's add something else.\\nLet's switch to for example, Icon mode,\\nwhere you have a more simplistic rendition of various icons.\\nSo let's try this sample prompt.\\nI'm going to click this one, which is a minimalist mountain.\\nIt will do the exact same thing.\\nIt will think about three separate designs,\\nstart with some artwork,\\nand then colorize the artwork afterwards.\\nAnd again, it's just a matter of clicking\\nto find that mountain\\nand then placing that mountain on another side,\\nsomething like this.\\n\\nAnd maybe this is the design\\nfor one of my next travel cards.\\nWho know?\\nSo the thing is, this is something\\nthat's actually very, very easy to use,\\nand I think I've given you a very quick introduction\\nto what it is you can do and how it basically works.\\nBut you know what?\\nin the next

in here inside of this prompt box,\\nand I'm going to click the X to get started.\\nI'm going to start typing in something very, very specific.\\nI'm going to type in a green jungle with trees,\\ncomma, space, plants, comma, space, and a river.\\n\\nI'm going to go ahead and hit Enter or Return to confirm,\\nand I will let Firefly do its thing\\nand come up with three individual scene ideas.\\nLet's give it a couple of seconds.\\nIt has started out with the outlines,\\nand now it's going to be colorizing everything else.\\nThere we go, so this is the first version,\\nI'm going to place this here in the corner\\nof my art board by using the move tool,\\nhold down the Shift key, and then scale this up\\nuntil it fills the entire scene.\\nSo this looks kind of like a fun scene,\\nthis is one version, this is the second version,\\nand this is the third version.\\n\\nSo again, this looks quite simplistic,\\nI'm quite happy with this, actually, I have a lot of detail,\\nI have multiple colors, this looks pretty good.\\nNow, keep in mind that when you generate new artwork,\\nyou have a way to decide how much detail you want to have\\nin the vector graphics themselves.\\nFor example, if I were to move this slider here\\nand make this very complex and then click generate again,\\nit's going to generate another iteration\\nof that same prompt, but I'm allowing it\\nto create more complex shapes\\nand just add a lot more details\\nto the iteration that I have here,\\nso let's quickly compare this, I'm going to put this one\\nlet's say here on the-left hand side,\\nI'll just snap this to the corner,\\nhold down the Shift key, scale this up.\\n\\nAnd now you can see here on the left-hand side,\\nthere's just a lot more going on on the left-hand side.\\nThe foliage is just a lot busier, especially if you look\\nat I think this one here, there's just a lot more detail.\\nSo you have to decide how complex\\nyou really want to make these designs.\\nAnd so you can always click this one\\nand then just lower the detail as you see fit\\nand then just recreate one of these prompts here.\\nI have to say, I do kind of like the one\\non the right a little bit better\\nbecause this is a children's book after all.\\n\\nI'm going to go ahead and just delete this version\\nthat I have here.\\nNow I need to add a subject to my scene.\\nI'm going to go ahead and click the subject option.\\nAnd now I'm going to go ahead and change the prompt\\nthat I have here.\\nI'll just quickly click the X icon\\nand I'll type in something else,\\nI type in a flying exotic bird.\\nI'm going to hit Enter or Return,\\nand I'm going to take a look here\\nand see what I'm getting as a result.\\nI'll give this a couple of seconds,\\nand I'm curious to see what kind\\nof birds I'm going to get from Adobe Firefly.\\n\\nSo let's give this a few seconds, there we go,\\nI'll move the bird to the left-hand side\\njust to get started, I'll scale this up.\\nI have to say I do like the design here,\\nso this is one version of this bird.\\nI'll use this arrow, this is the second version,\\na bit more color, and now I have this third version\\nof the bird.\\nNow, this looks a bit like a hummingbird,\\nwhich I associate with a bird that is quite static.\\nSo I'm going to go for this one.\\nSo I'm just going to go ahead here, scale this down a bit,\\nand I'm going to move this bird here directly within the scene.\\n\\nNow, this bird is using its own color palette,\\nand keep in mind that you do have a way\\nof changing color palette based on selections\\nas you are generating more artwork,\\nbut we'll keep that for the next video,\\nbut for now, just keep in mind that you have control\\nover the individual colors when you are generating assets,\\nso that's really important for you guys to know.\\nNow, there's one last thing I do want to do,\\nand that is I would like to create a pattern\\nthat's going to go here on the left-hand side\\nof this book proposition, so just imagine\\nthat the left-hand side is part of the inlay of my book\\nand I just want to create a simple pattern\\non that left-hand side.\\n\\nSo I'm going to go ahead here,\\nI'm going to switch to pattern mode.\\nAnd again, I have a couple of settings here.\\nI can choose from various styles to change\\nwhat the colors might look like.\\nI can set color limitations to simplify the pattern.\\nBut for now, I'm just going to go ahead, click the X,\\nand type in a different prompt.\\nSo I'm going to type in monkeys and jungle vines.\\nI'm going to go ahead, I'm going to press Enter\\nor Return to confirm.\\nAnd now Firefly is going to create three seamless patterns\\nthat I can now directly use here inside\\nof Adobe Illustrator.\\n\\nSo let's give this a couple of seconds here.\\nLook, there are the three monkey designs already.\\nSo I'm getting one, two, three designs,\\nI'm going to try this one here, I'm going to click that.\\nAnd it says new pattern added to swatches, which is great,\\nso the moment you click that, it's actually adding that\\nto your swatches.\\nI'm going to go ahead and just create a rectangle using\\nthe rectangle tool.\\nAnd as you look at this design, I do have monkeys.\\n\\nLet's go ahead here, let's try this one, let's try this one.\\nLooks quite similar.\\nI like the colors a little bit better.\\nAnd there's another one here on the left-hand side\\nthat looks like this, I think I'm going to go for the last one,\\nI think I'm going to go for this one here.\\nAnd this is it, this is how simple it is\\nto add these different versions and different types\\nof artwork here directly into Adobe Illustrator.\\nSo again, simple example of how to add a scene,\\nhow to add a subject, and how to create a seamless pattern.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5941026\",\"duration\":374,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Controlling

[Instructor] Let's take a few minutes\\njust to talk about the different style settings\\nwhen using the Text to Vector Graphic functionality\\nhere inside of Adobe Illustrator.\\nI've gone ahead and I've placed three very different items\\nonto this specific art board.\\nHere, this item features a lot of greens,\\nand this is something created\\nusing the Text to Vector Graphic functionality.\\nThis element features a lot of oranges and blues,\\nand it comes from Adobe Stock,\\nwhile the last image comes from Photoshop.\\n\\nAnd I created this image using text to image\\ndirectly in Photoshop.\\nThis is just a rasterized image, by the way.\\nThis is not a vector shape.\\nNow, I have to create a specific prompt\\nand I'm going to do this using Text to Vector Graphic,\\nand I want to show you just what it is you can do\\nto set a very specific style\\nwhen you are generating these graphics.\\nNow, up until now, we've simply just gone ahead,\\ntyped in a prompt, and then just hit Enter or Return\\njust to get something back from Illustrator.\\n\\nNow, know that you can also preset the size\\nof your specific prompt,\\na bit like making a selection first in Photoshop\\nusing the marquee selection tool\\nand then just using Gen Fill,\\nafter which Firefly will use that selection size\\nas like a mini-canvas to work with.\\nWe can do the exact same thing.\\nSo, let's go ahead here.\\nI'll take the rectangle tool.\\nI'm just going to go ahead and just draw a rectangle.\\nNow, what happens is that if you now go ahead\\nand generate something,\\nfor example, a dog reading a book, cute, kawaii,\\nand this is a subject right now,\\njust go ahead and hit the Generate option.\\n\\nNow, because I have an object selected\\nand I'm now generating this subject,\\nIllustrator is going to use my selection as an actual canvas,\\nand it's going to project that vector shape\\ninto my selection itself,\\nbasically replacing its contents.\\nNow, this just comes in with various different versions,\\nand it's not really linked to a specific style\\nbased on any of these different objects.\\nNow, let's try this again.\\nLet's quickly just delete this item.\\nLet's drag a brand-new rectangle and let's start anew.\\n\\nNow, if you're looking at these settings, here,\\nthere's one specific setting that you can apply\\nwhich is called Reference Asset.\\nI'm going to go ahead,\\nI'm going to click this option to activate that.\\nI'm going to click the first one, which is artwork.\\nNow it simply says Reference Asset,\\nbut I don't really see how\\nthat's going to change any of my results.\\nNow, look what happens.\\nIf I were to click and drag this element, now,\\nI'll give it a white fill so I can easily select it.\\nIf I drag this onto this artwork, now, look what happens.\\n\\nIt is now detecting the artwork\\nthat is next to or around the selected area of my shape.\\nIf I move the shape in this vicinity and let go,\\nit's going to pick out this artwork.\\nIf I move this into the picture,\\nit will pick up the artwork of the picture.\\nWhich means that if I move this,\\nlet's say, here in the middle,\\nand if I now just rerun that same prompt,\\nit's going to take in the visual style\\nof the surrounding elements of my current selection\\nand apply that as I'm now creating this dog image.\\n\\nSo, let's give this a couple of seconds\\nto see what that does.\\nAnd this is the result I have,\\nso clearly, it has now picked up on the visual style\\nof this specific version,\\nwhich is kind of cool, see?\\nNow, let's try this again.\\nI'm going to go ahead and just create a second rectangle.\\nI'll put this here in the vicinity of this green area.\\nIt is picking up the artwork,\\nand the only thing I have to do now\\nis just click the Generate option\\njust to reinterpret the same prompt,\\nbut use this artwork as a visual reference,\\nwhich means I'm expecting a whole lot of greens to come in\\nand I'm expecting some of the other\\nyellows and blues as well.\\n\\nLet's take a look at this one\\nand I'll just pick this dog.\\nThere we go.\\nAnd I'll try this again.\\nI'm going to go ahead,\\nI'm going to position this here.\\nAnd just so you know,\\nyou don't always have to use the same methodology,\\nbecause now it seems that I have to physically move\\nthis rectangle on top of the artwork\\nfor it to detect the style,\\nand then I have to drag it back.\\nYou don't necessarily have to do that.\\nIf you know beforehand what this style is you want to pick up,\\nyou can also switch to the picker mode\\nand then simply go ahead\\nand select whatever artwork you want to select.\\n\\nNow, you can actually go ahead\\nand you can choose this artwork to pick it up,\\nor you can choose this artwork if you want to.\\nYou can even click and drag\\nand only include specific portions of artwork,\\nor you can just go ahead and just click to select,\\nin this case, the image that we have here.\\nAnd so, once this has been set using a picker,\\nit doesn't quite matter\\nwhere this rectangle is now positioned,\\nThe only thing you have to do now is just type in the prompt\\nand then hit the Generate option again\\nto use that style for anything that you now generate,\\nregardless of where this shape\\nis now being positioned on the art board\\nand whatever artwork might be in its vicinity.\\n\\nBased on that, I'm going to go ahead\\nand take a look at this, here,\\nand you can clearly see\\nthat this is also taking in a lot of more detail.\\nThe one on the left is green and pretty simplistic,\\nand that's also what I'm getting here in this dog.\\nThis one has black outlines with thick lines,\\nlots of oranges and lots of blues,\\nwhich I'm seeing here.\\nAnd this one is a lot more complex.\\nThere are no black outlines.\\nThere's just greens,\\nand there are pinks and some oranges,\\nand that, too, is what I'm seeing here.\\n\\nSo, this is not just having an effect\\non the color theme that you're using.\\nIt also really has an effect on the visual style\\nof what is you're creating and what that's going to look like.\\nIt's easy to overlook these options here,\\nbut please, use them as best as you can,\\nbecause it will save you so much headache\\nlater throughout your workflow.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2723032\",\"duration\":302,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Introducing Generative Recolor in

[Instructor] The last feature\\nI want to talk about is generative recolor.\\nGenerative recolor allows you to use a prompt\\nto dynamically create a color theme,\\nafter which you can then apply that color theme\\nto your selected artwork to recolor it.\\nLet me show you an example.\\nSo here, instead of Adobe Illustrator, I have this document,\\nit's called T-shirt Designs Start.\\nAnd let me show you how this file is currently built up.\\nSo there's a background image here,\\nwhich is currently locked,\\nwhich means you can't really select it.\\n\\nAnd then here I have an outline of a T-shirt\\nthat is currently set to a multiply blending mode,\\nwhich means it's going to blend the color into the background\\ncombined with the white T-shirt we have here\\nin the original image.\\nAnd then there's the artwork.\\nThis is the artwork I currently have,\\nand the idea is to recolor both elements\\nto make it look like a different version of my design.\\nI'm just going to go ahead and just press command Z\\non the keyboard or control Z in Windows,\\njust to put everything back where it came from.\\n\\nNow let's get started here.\\nLet's select both the T-shirt and the artwork,\\nand then I'm going to choose the Recolor option\\nthat appears here.\\nNow, if for some reason you don't see that option here,\\nyou can always just go up to the edit menu,\\nchoose Edit Colors,\\nand then choose Generative Recolor,\\nwhich does the exact same thing.\\nSo be sure to end up here on the Generative Recolor option,\\nand not here by the way.\\nSo be sure to always click here\\nto access the Firefly capabilities.\\n\\nNow this comes with a couple of sample prompts\\nand let's start with a sample prompts\\njust to get started.\\nI'm going to go ahead here\\nand just click, let's say the dark blue midnight option just\\nby hovering over that, hitting the mouse button\\nand then seeing which four versions I'm going to get here\\nfor this specific design.\\nSo I've got this version, this version.\\nI've got this one, and I've got that one here.\\nSo I've got like four different iterations\\nof the same design.\\nI'm going to go ahead\\nand just choose this one just to get started.\\n\\nNow let's just quickly navigate\\nto another version of the same T-shirt.\\nLet's try this again. Let's make a selection.\\nLet's click Recolor, make sure we are here\\nin the Generative Recolor tab.\\nAnd let's try this again.\\nBut this time I'm going to go for something\\nthat's maybe a bit more pink.\\nSo let's try this one, the trippy disco lights.\\nLet's click to apply that sample prompt\\nand we'll wait a few seconds\\nand then we're going to get a couple of designs\\nthat look a bit more purple, pink.\\n\\nIt's going to be a bit more red in there as well.\\nAnd so again, because I have both elements selected,\\nI'm going to be recalling both elements at the same time.\\nSo I think we're going to go for this one.\\nI kind of like the pink version here.\\nNow let's try to do as ourselves now.\\nLet's go back to this version.\\nLet's select all the artwork.\\nChoose Recolor, Generative Recolor.\\nLet's try and type in something ourselves.\\nNow, just one tip here,\\nwhen you do want to use your own prompts,\\ntry to keep these prompts in Illustrator,\\nkind of short and sweet.\\n\\nSo just use maybe somewhere between three\\nand eight different words and it's kind of it,\\nbut if you add more, it will just confuse Illustrator.\\nSo just keep it short and sweet.\\nSo I'm going to type in something like frogs and lizards.\\nI'll hit enter or return,\\nand it's going to base a color theme on these words.\\nSo I'm expecting to get something back\\nthat probably going to look a bit greenish.\\nThere we go. Let's take a look at these ones here.\\nLet's go for this. This is actually not too bad.\\n\\nAnd now let's take a look at the very last one.\\nAnd so here for this one,\\nI do want to change these colors independently.\\nSo I'm going to go ahead and just select the T-shirt.\\nI'm just going to double click the fill color\\non the left hand side.\\nI'm going to choose something\\nthat is a bit like so, a bit more magenta like.\\nAnd now I'm going to select just the artwork.\\nChoose Recolor, Generative Recolor,\\nand I'm going to type in something else.\\nLet's type in something like eighties neon or something.\\n\\nLet's hit return and let's see what else we get as a result.\\nGive it a few seconds\\nand then we're going to take a look at some\\nof the results that we have here.\\nNow keep in mind that if you're not quite happy\\nwith the results that are being returned to you,\\nI like this one by the way.\\nThen you can always just go\\ninto the normal recolor options here\\nand just refine the color theme that was generated.\\nSo it's never really a one stop shop\\nas it doesn't really stop.\\nSo what you can do is just basically go back\\nto the more traditional recoloring tools\\nafter having used AI.\\n\\nAnd you can still go in\\nand you can still turn the sliders here.\\nYou can just play around with everything\\nthat you basically want.\\nBut in general, this just gives you a very quick\\nand easy way just to create different variations\\nof the same artwork using AI.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5938037\",\"duration\":64,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge: Text to

need\\nto verify information sources in the media,\\nor what is Adobe doing to make sure\\nthat Adobe Firefly will help uphold ethical standards?\\nNow, these questions and concerns\\nare being addressed by an organization\\ncalled the Content Authenticity Initiative.\\n\\nAnd this organization was first announced\\nby Adobe back in 2019.\\nAnd since their first announcement,\\nhundreds of members have joined the cause,\\nincluding Microsoft, BBC, Intel, and many more.\\nNow, this coalition is on a mission\\nto help address misinformation\\nand content authenticity at scale.\\nBut how are they doing this?\\nWell, they're doing this by introducing\\nthe world's first tamper-evident metadata\\nfor images called Content Credentials.\\n\\nNow, you can look at Content Credentials\\nas a type of digital nutrition label for digital images.\\nSo, adding this metadata to images\\nwill help build credibility\\nand trust by sharing the details about the creative process\\nthat is required to create the image in the first place.\\nAnd by providing this metadata, you can describe the history\\nand the image provenance, and this system can help\\nthe spread of misinformation over time.\\nSo, whenever you download an image\\nfrom the Adobe Firefly website,\\nthese Content Credentials will always be applied\\nto the download file automatically.\\n\\nAnd this happens even when you're using Firefly directly\\nin applications like Photoshop.\\nAnd you can even activate the same Content Credentials\\nin Photoshop projects\\nthat don't even use Adobe Firefly technology\\nto

[Instructor] Let me explain to you\\nhow you can view content credentials\\nwhen downloading images from Adobe Firefly\\nor when you're manipulating images using Adobe Photoshop.\\nSo I'm here in Photoshop\\nwhere I have opened up chickens.jpeg,\\nand this is an image I generated\\nusing the Adobe Firefly webpage,\\nand it's probably one of the coolest images I've created\\nin the last couple of months.\\nIt's just three chickens, making their getaway\\nin an improvised sailing boat.\\nI mean, what is not to like?\\nNow, what I did was actually quite simple.\\n\\nI just used the text to image functionality\\non the Firefly webpage\\nand then I simply downloaded that image\\nand I opened up the image here inside of Photoshop.\\nNow, let's take a look\\nat the content credentials of this image.\\nSo I'm going to go ahead here, I'll choose window,\\nthen I'll choose content credentials.\\nNow, it is asking me to enable content credentials,\\nbut this is actually a very important step.\\nSo just so you know, when you download an image\\nfrom the Adobe Firefly website,\\nor even when you hit the copy command\\non the Firefly website, content credentials\\nthat explain the origin of the image and the fact\\nthat you've used Firefly\\nwill always be embedded in this image.\\n\\nThere is no way of cheating your way\\nout of content credentials\\nif your image is produced using Firefly.\\nSo this means that I cannot tell people\\nthat I've actually built this image by hand.\\nThis is clearly something where AI was involved.\\nNow, I have an enable option here, which basically means\\nthat if I click that, which I will do now, there we go,\\nthat from now on, I will be recording\\nsome of the steps and some of the manipulations\\nthat I will be applying to this image\\nas part of the content credentials dataset.\\n\\nSo it is automatically capturing a couple of things.\\nFor example, it has captured the Gen AI transparency.\\nAs in, it will automatically bake in the fact\\nthat I have used Firefly.\\nNow, this is always checked by default.\\nIt will capture my name as a producer,\\nI can use this to connect social media accounts as well,\\nwhich looks like this by the way.\\nSo this is where that link will take you.\\nSo this basically allows you\\nto connect social media accounts, which can then help\\nto verify your identity as the original author\\nand owner of this particular piece of work.\\n\\nAnd then you can also capture the edits\\nand the activity here inside of this image.\\nAgain, this is all about transparency.\\nThis is about sharing and proving the fact\\nthat this is really your creation.\\nNow, if you hit the preview option,\\nyou can also expose some additional information as well.\\nFor example, it says\\nthat this image combines multiple pieces of content.\\nAt least one was generated with an AI tool.\\nAnd it says people will be able\\nto view the following information with your content.\\nSo it has a file name, it's called chickens.jpeg,\\nand it was here, opened up using Photoshop\\nand there was an AI model used, which is Firefly.\\n\\nSo this is basically the information I already get.\\nIt says produced by,\\nand then it should show your own personal name.\\nBut in this case, it's just showing the username\\nof this specific creative cloud account here\\nat LinkedIn Learning.\\nNow, something else that you might notice is the fact\\nthat it now has the content credentials icon next to name,\\nwhich means that this has now been activated\\nand a little asterisk here, which means\\nthat the file has been edited.\\nSo this is really a step where you start to edit\\nand manipulate this image.\\nSo you do have to save this image if you want to continue.\\n\\nNow, let me show you another example here.\\nSo let's quickly go here inside of this file.\\nSo adventure.psd, I'm going to open up this file here.\\nAnd it says, enable content credentials.\\nThis document has content credentials attached to it.\\nEdit activity or attribution information may be shown\\nas missing if content credentials is not enabled.\\nI'm just going to go ahead and click enable.\\nNow, let me show you what this image is.\\nSo this is an image of a project that I'm sure\\nthat you will recognize.\\nAnd I've actually come in, I've done a couple\\nof small edits.\\n\\nSo here on the right-hand side in the layers panel,\\nlet me show you what I did here.\\nSo I added a very basic curves layer,\\nwhich I'm switching on and off here,\\njust to kind of add a bit more contrast\\nand warmth to the image.\\nAnd then secondly, I imported this element here.\\nThis is just a flock of birds.\\nNow, these birds come from this stock image.\\nSo this is the original image,\\nI simply dragged and dropped in the image,\\nand then I used a layer mask\\nto basically paint out some of the areas\\nand I'm also using a bit of advanced blending\\njust to blend in the birds a bit better.\\n\\nI'm using a multiply blending mode.\\nSo anyway, there's a lot going on here.\\nSo I just made a couple of edits which result\\nin two additional images.\\nNow, the thing is that when you're done\\nwith your specific composition, you have to save this image\\nand you have to expose the content credentials\\nwhen you share this image with others.\\nSo there's a good chance that you might have someone\\nthat says, \\\"Hey, can you share with me your work?\\\"\\nThen I would really suggest\\nthat you share your work in such a way that kind of exposes\\nand proves that you really are the author of this work.\\n\\nNow, this is especially important if you're applying\\nfor new work as a artist,\\nor maybe you're working for the press or the news\\nand you want to simply send off an image\\nthat basically depicts a real scene.\\nWell, then you just do have to try and prove\\nand open up the fact\\nthat this image was not manipulated in any way.\\nSo how do you go about doing this?\\nYou go to file and then you basically choose export,\\nand then you choose export as.\\nAnd then from here, you have\\nto choose a content credentials options.\\n\\nIt's actually giving me a pop-up already\\nthat says publish the credentials.\\nIt says you can publish your files content credentials\\nto the content credentials cloud when exporting\\ninstead of attaching them to your files.\\nNow, this makes the edit and activity history\\nmore persistent and recoverable\\nand keeps the file size smaller.\\nSo it's basically saying, if you want, I can take\\nall that history and publish that to a cloud\\ninstead of just attaching that locally to the file,\\nwhich might make the file size grow,\\nor which might enable you to, sometimes,\\ndisable or deactivate the content credentials functionality,\\nwhich might result in missed steps being recorded.\\n\\nSo this is basically what you can do.\\nSo I'm going to say, make publish\\nto content credentials cloud my default preference setting,\\nI'll just choose OK.\\nNow, this has been set.\\nNow, in these options, just so you know,\\nif you scroll all the way down, it says content credentials.\\nAnd so this option has now been checked\\nsimply because I hit the OK button.\\nNow, you can choose not to include any credentials\\nor you can choose to attach them here directly to the jpeg,\\nwhich means that the credentials\\nwill travel with the document offline.\\nWhile on this option, you get to publish your credentials\\ndirectly to the cloud.\\n\\nAnd the thing is, if you look at the generated image here\\nat the end, it's just a normal image,\\nyou don't really see any difference.\\nHowever, there is a way to verify this information,\\nwhich is something we'll talk about in the next video.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5941024\",\"duration\":329,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Verifying content credentials from external

[Tutor] Now that we have exported our project\\nas a JPEG file with the content credentials attached,\\nit's time to show you the experience that others go\\nthrough when they are receiving your images.\\nSo imagine that you're working with someone else,\\nlet's tell you a publisher or maybe a media agency\\nand they want to see your work.\\nYou're taking pictures, you're making very small edits,\\nfor example, and you want to send them a picture,\\nbut they're asking you for content credentials just to prove\\nthat you might have only changed the brightness of an image,\\nfor example, but you haven't really manipulated the image\\nlike I have just in this project.\\n\\nSo how do you go about doing this?\\nSo what you do is you would basically navigate\\nto this webpage.\\nYou would go to content credentials.org/verify,\\nand this is a starting point\\nto actually verify the origin of an image.\\nNow it's asking you for an image itself here.\\nSo it does support multiple formats.\\nThis includes JPEG files, but also video files\\nand even a PDF file.\\nSo the only thing you do is you just take that file\\nand then you drag and drop the file here in the webpage\\nto start the analysis.\\n\\nAnd this is the result that we're getting.\\nNow, before we just dive into the details here,\\njust so you know, as you might remember,\\nwe had two different options.\\nEither we publish the content credentials to the cloud,\\nwhich means that the information you see\\nhere on the right hand side\\nand even the information you see\\nhere is picked up from the cloud\\nbecause it recognizes the data\\nthat was here inside of this image.\\nThe other option was the fact that we could embed\\nthat information directly in the file, which means\\nthat the information you see here at this stage\\nhere doesn't really come from this cloud service.\\n\\nIt just comes and it just extracts the information\\nfrom the JPEG that you dragged into the system.\\nNow let's take a look at some of the information\\nthat this system has picked up.\\nNow we can see here in the middle\\nthat it's actually exposing the individual ingredients\\nof the image that we've worked with.\\nFor example, I can see the original JPEG file that we used.\\nI can click this option\\nand now it actually shows you where this image comes from\\nand it is so smart that it actually picked up the fact\\nthat this was Adobe Stock and then the actual file name,\\nand it actually shows you the direct URL\\nto that stock document, which is kind of smart.\\n\\nIt says it accounts from Adobe Stock issued\\nby Adobe, et cetera.\\nAnd it's not just doing\\nthis because this is an Adobe Stock image.\\nKeep in mind that the contents authenticity initiative\\nwas co-founded by Adobe, but it's not owned by Adobe.\\nThis is not an Adobe product.\\nSo if you're using stock images from different suppliers\\nlike Getty Images for iStock, it will always try\\nand list the origin of that original image.\\nThis is not just an Adobe thing basically.\\nNow, what's also interesting here is if I click\\nthis main image again, is that it actually shows\\nyou that I was using is this version of Photoshop.\\n\\nIt says I have made color or exposure edits.\\nI've made a combination of content.\\nI have made drawing edits,\\nwhich was me brushing in the layer mask by the way.\\nI have made an import command\\nbecause that's how I dragged in this image of these birds.\\nI've opened up elements\\nand I've also rotated these birds just ever so slightly.\\nSo this is all the information\\nI'm getting from these content credentials.\\nNow you can also click the compare option\\nhere at the bottom, and that's actually going to allow\\nyou to look at the final result\\nand then click on individual ingredients here.\\n\\nSo if I click on this one, it's going to show you the before\\nand after versions of this file.\\nIt's pretty low resolution,\\nbut still it did capture just a quick snapshot\\nof what that image looked like originally.\\nSo again, you just go ahead\\nand just inspect these individual ingredients\\nin a side by side view.\\nNow one last thing, which I think is kind of interesting,\\nis you can click the search for possible matches option.\\nAnd this is actually really good\\nbecause if you have an image that you receive\\nand you do want to kind of check\\nand see if someone else might have used\\nthat image in some way in Photoshop, one way\\nor the other, using content credentials, this is the way\\nto find out because these kind credentials are synchronized\\nto the cloud by default,\\nwhich means it all ends up in this big database.\\n\\nSo I'm going to click here, search for a possible matches\\njust to see whatever comes up here.\\nThis comes a few seconds just to come up with matches.\\nOh look, there's a couple of matches here.\\nSo one image was generated on May 23rd, for example,\\nI'm going to click this one and there's one here.\\nSo apparently this one, I'm going to hit the fit option.\\nSo this one has a hot air balloon.\\nI have no idea who built this, by the way.\\nLet's try this one. There's a, there's a dinosaur.\\nI did not expect this. I'll be honest, I did not do this.\\nThis is someone else on the web somewhere.\\n\\nSo someone made a big dinosaur, which is kind of fun.\\nAnother dinosaur, somebody really like dinosaurs.\\nSo basic, look at this one. There's a raccoon.\\nThere's a raccoon in a church.\\nSo basically this kind of allows you just to see\\nwhat else other people have done\\nby using this functionality.\\nAnd the fact that they've been using Firefly automatically\\nattaches these content credentials.\\nSo that publishes them to the cloud as well,\\nwhich is kind of neat, I got to say.\\nSo this is how you go about looking at content credentials\\nand verifying the identity\\nor the origin of very, very specific images.\\n\\nNow, this information, this technology is very easy\\nto use just like Adobe Firefly.\\nAnd so this will allow you to make sure\\nthat you do have the origin of an image exposed\\nto whoever you're working with,\\nand be sure to ask others for their content credentials\\nas well as you're working with external freelancers\\nor maybe other agencies.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"8.

[Instructor] Now that you've come\\nto the end of this course,\\nyou should have a good understanding\\nof Adobe Firefly's capabilities.\\nYou've used the Firefly website for generating images\\nand you've used tools like Photoshop to expand a canvas\\nor Illustrator to create vector graphics\\nor even just to recolor artwork\\nand Express for creating just new designs from scratch\\nand applying text effects.\\nNow, this means that you might be asking yourself:\\nIs this it?\\nIs there more?\\nLike what else can I do with Firefly?\\nWell, to tell you the truth,\\nthere is more.\\n\\nAt the time of this recording,\\nAdobe has previewed their first steps\\nusing Adobe Firefly for using video\\nand Premiere Pro in a combination with AI.\\nAnd then there is 3D and Adobe Firefly.\\nWhen you're using Adobe Substance,\\nyou might want to generate specific backgrounds or textures\\nfor 3D renders,\\nbut there is actually a lot more to talk about.\\nLet me explain why that is.\\nAdobe Firefly is available today\\nin your normal Creative Cloud membership,\\nallowing you to use the most common functionalities,\\nwhich also enabled you to finish this entire course.\\n\\nBut know that there are additional functionalities available\\nfor larger enterprises\\nthat deal with very specific use cases\\nwhere automation might be required\\nor where proprietary data needs to be used.\\nNow these functionalities,\\nthey're all available as a separate Adobe Firefly offering\\ndirectly via Adobe,\\nand they just offer you more functionalities.\\nNow, I'm not here to talk about\\nthe very details of how this whole system works,\\nbut just know that you do have a couple of extra things\\nto play with.\\n\\nwhich offers you an extra layer of legal protection\\nwhen using AI generated content.\\nYou have the ability to create surroundings\\nfor your own retail products\\nwhen creating object compositions,\\nor you can even automate some of Firefly's capabilities.\\nAnd if you want,\\nyou can even use a custom model\\nwhere you train Firefly with your own proprietary data.\\nFor example, if you have a product\\nand you want Firefly to feature that product\\nwhen you're prompting for new images.\\n\\nNow, let's take a look at just one simple example\\nof just one of these features.\\nI'm going to talk about object compositions here.\\nSo object compositions is a feature\\nbaked in within the Adobe Firefly website\\nwhere you simply go ahead\\nand then you upload an image of your own product.\\nNow you might recognize the pink purse that we've used\\nwhen we're using generative fill\\ninstead of Adobe Photoshop.\\nSo if I were to drag and drop this purse into Firefly,\\neither as a JPEG or as a transparent PNG,\\nit allows me to position this\\nsomewhere on this virtual canvas.\\n\\nAnd then the next phase,\\nit allows me to type in the prompt I'm looking for,\\nfor example, in this case,\\na marble table in a living room.\\nAnd it's going to take that product\\nand put it into the scene\\nbased on where I specified the product should appear.\\nSo on the left hand side,\\nit's actually using a type of extension\\nbased on the structure reference\\nthat we've learned here in this course,\\nand it's just going to combine that product now\\ndirectly here within this image.\\nNow, what makes this unique is the following.\\n\\nIf you look at some of the details of this actual render,\\nyou can see that it now generated a shadow\\nthat sits just underneath the purse,\\nwhich wasn't there in the original image.\\nWe had an image without any shadows.\\nAnd also notice the reflection on the marble,\\nand that is what makes object compositions unique\\nbecause you simply drag and drop in your product,\\nyou type in the circumstances,\\nmaybe your product should be sitting on\\nwhatever as part of an ice sculpture,\\nagain, you'll have reflections and you'll have shadows,\\nthe lighting will match, et cetera.\\n\\nSo this is just one application of what is you can do\\nif you extend these functionalities in Firefly.\\nNow, just so you know that there are a couple of use cases\\nthat are really, really interesting\\nif you look at this extra technology,\\nnot just the object compositions,\\nbut everything else,\\nthe automation,\\nusing your own systems,\\nusing your own data as part of a custom model.\\nSo for example, you can even choose\\nto automate banner creation.\\nWhat if you have a banner in Photoshop\\nthat measures very specific pixel dimensions\\nand you have to create a square version\\nand maybe a vertical or a horizontal version,\\ndifferent sizes?\\nWhat you can do is you can now use generative expand\\nin combination with APIs and other automation techniques\\njust to bulk generate all these different versions\\nin one go.\\n\\nProduct visualization is something that you can do\\nby using your own custom model\\nor by using the object composition\\nthat we've just discussed.\\nAnd you can even do batch post-processing\\nwhere you basically go in\\nand you have the ability\\nto use a combination of Firefly prompts,\\nyou can remove backgrounds from images,\\nreplace 'em with a Firefly prompt,\\nexpand the canvas,\\neven automate this by applying Lightroom presets.\\nThe sky is kind of the limit here.\\nSo all of these are like little custom projects\\nand this technology exists today.\\n\\nSo if you do have any questions\\nabout all these different things here,\\nI would suggest you take a look\\nat the Adobe help pages to get started.\\nOr if you have the ability,\\nget in touch with Adobe directly\\njust to see what else they can do for you.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5938036\",\"duration\":57,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Goodbye\",\"fileName\":\"2118184_en_US_09_02_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":false,\"rawDurationSeconds\":67,\"exerciseFileDisplayText\":\"N/A\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"This

[Instructor] Let's start this chapter by showing you\\nhow to create seamless patterns\\nusing Adobe Firefly and Adobe Photoshop.\\nBut at the time of this recording,\\nyou can only generate a vector pattern using Adobe Firefly\\nin combination with Adobe Illustrator.\\nBut there's no real way of turning a text to image prompt\\ninto a real seamless pattern.\\nSo let's find a way around that.\\nHere inside of Adobe Firefly,\\nI have just entered a very basic prompt.\\nThe only thing I typed in\\nwas colorful birds, seamless pattern,\\nand I'm also making sure\\nthat I'm using the square aspect ratio.\\n\\nNow, you might think that all the work is now done\\nbecause I simply added the words seamless pattern.\\nIt doesn't quite work like that.\\nNow, what you have to do first\\nis you have to look at the results\\nthat you have here inside of Adobe Firefly.\\nIf I click one of these results\\nand try and inspect what this might look like,\\nyou might think that this looks pretty perfect.\\nI mean, after all, the bird that is kind of leaving\\nthe scene here on the right hand side\\nis being reintroduced on the left hand side.\\nSame thing here.\\n\\nand that seems to be this bird's head.\\nSo, this does seem to be a seamless pattern.\\nWell, we'll check that in just a few minutes.\\nLet's look at the second example here.\\nNow, this is the second result\\nI currently have within my prompt.\\nAnd again, you might think\\nthat this looks beautiful and perfect.\\nJust take a look at some of the details here.\\nThe bird I have here on the right hand side,\\nI mean I can see its head, but I'm not really seeing\\na lot of its body on the left hand side,\\nso I am missing bird.\\n\\nSo, this means that this is not going to be a seamless pattern.\\nSo, be very careful when you go ahead\\nand you find or use any of these examples.\\nNow, you can go ahead and just check\\nand go through all these different examples,\\nbut basically what you have to do\\nis you have to look at these first results\\nand kind of imagine what that would look like as a pattern.\\nI mean, looking at these examples here,\\nI would really say that the pattern\\non the top left and the one at the bottom right\\nare probably going to give you the best results.\\n\\nNow, once you've kind of gone through the initial selection\\nby inspecting the details,\\nor maybe even regenerating results,\\nyou will find an image that you like.\\nAnd now, just to make sure\\nthat we're all on the same page here,\\nI've actually gone ahead\\nand I have already downloaded one of these images,\\nand this is the one.\\nIt's called colorful birds_seamless pattern.jpg,\\nand you can find this inside of your project files.\\nNow, this is what the image looks like.\\nNow, to get started, I'm going to go ahead.\\nI'm going to open up this image here inside of Adobe Photoshop,\\nand I'm going to take a look at what that looks like.\\n\\nNow, this looks like a seamless pattern,\\nbut we have to verify this,\\nand then come in and make any corrections if need be.\\nNow to make that work, I would basically have to see\\nif the edge on the right hand side\\naligns with the one on the left hand side,\\nand the same thing for the top and the bottom.\\nNow, to make that work,\\nI would like to use a very specific filter.\\nI'm going to go up to the filter menu and I will choose Other.\\nI'm going to choose Offset.\\nNow, offset is a pretty cool filter\\nbecause what it basically does is,\\nI'll just quickly put this back to zero and zero,\\nwhich is the default value.\\n\\nWhat it basically does is if you move this slider,\\nin this case, the horizontal slider,\\nit is going to move the entire canvas\\ntowards the left or the right,\\nand whatever disappears on the right hand side\\nis reintroduced on the left hand side.\\nSo, I'm basically moving the edge I would like to inspect.\\nNow, I know for a fact that this image\\nis 2048 by 2048 pixels\\nbecause that is the standard resolution\\nthat Adobe FireFly produces images\\nwith in the square aspect ratio.\\n\\nSo, this means that if I were to come in\\nand then type in 1024 by 1024,\\nit has actually moved the side\\nand the top edges towards the middle.\\nLet's press OK.\\nYou can actually see that here.\\nIf I zoom in, this is where all these edges meet.\\nAnd you can see that it is almost correct,\\nbut not quite yet.\\nSo, we have to come in and fix the transition\\nfrom this top end to this bottom end,\\nand the same thing going from left to right.\\n\\nTo fix that, we're going to be using more Adobe Firefly.\\nSimply click here to choose the rectangular marquee tool.\\nClick and drag to select an area that surrounds this seam.\\nSo, you can clearly see I've taken\\na little bit of extra margin here.\\nAnd then, press and hold down the Shift key\\nand then do the exact same thing.\\nSo, just click and drag just to select and merge\\nthese two selections together.\\nSo, you should end up with a cross-shaped selection.\\nNow with that selection active,\\nsimply click Generative Fill,\\nand then click Generate again to allow Firefly\\nto recreate the pixels that you've just selected.\\n\\nAnd because it knows that these areas should be connected,\\nit will actually go ahead\\nand remove those seams for you automatically.\\nThere we go. It has just done its thing.\\nI'm going to zoom in.\\nSo in the Properties panel,\\nI can choose from different variations here.\\nIt all looks pretty good.\\nAnd so, you can see that now these seams have been removed,\\nso I do end up with a seamless pattern.\\nNow, let's flatten everything.\\nLayer, choose Flatten Image,\\nwhich is going to merge everything together.\\n\\nAnd now, I can go ahead and save this as an actual pattern.\\nTo do that, choose Edit,\\nand then Choose Define Pattern.\\nI'll call this one birds. I'm going to press OK.\\nAnd now we are ready to give this a go.\\nLet's try out the new pattern.\\nNow to do this, you can open up this file, pattern-start.psd\\nand make sure that the background layer is selected.\\nThen, click this icon here to create a new layer,\\nand we're going to choose Pattern.\\n\\nFrom there, we're going to select a different pattern,\\nand we're going to go ahead

[Instructor] In this next video, I would like\\nto talk about using structure references.\\nNow I absolutely love structure references.\\nI love the creativity that comes with it\\nand just the fact that it's just so powerful,\\nit enables you to generate virtually any image\\nthat you want using Adobe Firefly.\\nBut my experience, building a structure reference yourself\\ncan be quite challenging, and I have noticed\\nthat if you don't build a structure reference the way\\nthat Firefly understands, you will lose a lot of time,\\nand your prompts will become pretty unpredictable.\\n\\nNow a structure reference can be anything.\\nIt can be a drawing on a paper napkin,\\nit can be an image as in an actual picture,\\nor it can be something that you generate yourself using\\nother software like Photoshop or Illustrator.\\nNow here in this example, I have added a very simple prompt\\nthat says white folded towels flying up in the air\\non a flat, bright blue background.\\nAnd so the idea is to generate an image\\nwhere the towels are actually folded\\nto spell out a specific word.\\n\\nAnd I want to use a structure reference to achieve that,\\nbut I want to be absolutely sure\\nthat my structure reference is going to make sense.\\nNow I know for a fact\\nthat my final composition should not be square,\\nbut it should be a portrait image.\\nI'm going to go ahead and choose Portrait,\\nand I'll go ahead and just choose Generate\\nto refresh my prompt.\\nNow this means that if you know\\nwhat aspect ratio you'll be using,\\nthat you have to adapt your structure reference\\nto the same aspect ratio.\\nNow let's take a look at one of the documents\\nthat we'll be using today.\\n\\nSo we're going to start out here\\nwith this Illustrator document,\\nand I'll be talking more about Illustrator\\nand using Illustrator for structure reference creation,\\nbut for now, let's just go ahead and open up text-start.ai.\\nNow this is a very simple artboard\\nthat just features three individual letters.\\nNow I have already gone ahead and outlined the text\\nso that it's easier to manipulate,\\nbut know that you can keep your text live\\nso you can always go back and make changes as you see fit.\\nNow imagine that the folded towels have\\nto look exactly like the word dry.\\n\\nTo make that work,\\nI have to make sure that my structure reference\\nalso matches the same aspect ratio as the image\\nthat's being produced by Adobe Firefly.\\nNow to do that, simply go ahead here\\nand click the artboard tool.\\nAnd now we're going to go ahead.\\nI'm going to change the size of the artboard.\\nNow there are a few ways to do that.\\nNow, personally, I like to go up here to the Window menu\\nand then choose Artboards.\\nAnd then from here, I'm going to click this icon here,\\nand that will allow me to set the specific definitions\\nand the width and height of that artboard.\\n\\nNow just by experimentation\\nand just downloading images from Firefly,\\nI know that the portrait orientation has a width\\nof 1,792 by 2,304 pixels.\\nNow that's very, very exact.\\nAnd go ahead and just choose OK.\\nThis is the image that will be generated using Firefly.\\nAnd now I just go ahead and just scale\\nand just reposition these letters any way I see fit.\\nI'll just place this one here, I'll place this one here,\\nand maybe that one over there.\\n\\nAgain, this is your playground, so you can just go ahead\\nand just position this inside of this canvas\\nbecause now I know for a fact\\nhow big these letters are going to be\\nand where they'll be positioned here specifically\\non this canvas.\\nNow I'm using white and black.\\nYou can use colors if you want to,\\nbut for now, for this simple example,\\nthis gives me more than enough contrast.\\nTo save this as an actual structure reference,\\nI'm going to go up to the File menu.\\nI'll choose Export, and I'll choose Export As.\\n\\nThere are a few very specific settings I would like to use.\\nI'm going to call this one structure,\\nand I'm going to save this one as a JPEG image.\\nAnd just so you know, I love using the Use Artboards option.\\nNow let's say for example that one\\nof these letters is bleeding off the edge, okay?\\nAnd you save this as a JPEG,\\nit will keep in the entire artwork,\\nwhich means that by default,\\nIllustrator will not be respecting\\nthe artboard canvas size that you've just set.\\n\\nTo avoid that, make sure you always click Use Artboards\\nto cut or trim or crop, or whatever you want to call this,\\nthe actual image to the artboard bounds themselves.\\nSo with that, I'm going to make sure Use Artboards is on\\neven nothing is really bleeding off the page,\\nbut it's just a good habit.\\nI'm going to call this one structure. I'll choose Export.\\nI'm just going to replace the one I already had.\\nAnd here I like to switch the color mode to RGB,\\nI'm going to crank up the quality all the way to the maximum,\\nand I also like changing the resolution from 72 to 300.\\n\\nThere we go. Just to get a bit more quality.\\nSimply choose OK,\\nand now we have saved our structure reference.\\nAnd with that, it's just a matter of applying the reference\\nby taking the JPEG file\\nand then dragging that here into Firefly.\\nSo I'm going to go ahead here and drag this here into Firefly.\\nI'll choose Continue.\\nI'm going to go ahead and just crank up the strength slider,\\nand I'm just going to choose Generate\\nto generate an image using that structure reference.\\nNow there are more settings that I should be applying,\\nbut that is something that we'll be discussing\\nin the next few videos.\\n\\nBut just know that if you follow along\\nin this entire course,\\nthat you'll be able to generate something\\nthat looks a bit more like this image,\\nwhere you do have the folded towels spelling out\\nthe word dry, respecting the font I used,\\nand also respecting the absolute position\\nof the elements on the canvas.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5958209\",\"duration\":343,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Combining style and structure

[Instructor] Now that you know\\nhow to build a structure reference using Illustrator,\\nlet's take that knowledge to the next level\\nand combine that with a style reference.\\nSo here inside of Illustrator,\\nI have created the word cheese,\\nand I have simply typed the word\\nand then applied a 3D effect to that.\\nI can still rotate the text,\\nI can come in, I can change the font any way I want.\\nAnd I have created this image here\\nas a specific widescreen orientation,\\nso this is 16 x 9 aspect ratio.\\n\\nI have already gone ahead,\\nI've saved this image here.\\nYou can find it as cheese-structure.png.\\nAnd I want to use that image\\nto create the word cheese made out of cheese.\\nSo this means that I know\\nwhat the structure reference looks like,\\nbut I still have to generate the texture\\nand the look and feel of that particular image.\\nNow there's two ways to do that.\\nEither you can take a picture of a block of cheese yourself,\\nyou can even use stock images,\\nor you can come into Adobe Firefly\\nand then start to generate these cheese images yourself.\\n\\nNow it's really important that these textures\\nand these settings,\\nwhich you'll then be combining with the structure,\\nare as basic as possible.\\nSo what I did is the following,\\nI typed in a block of yellow cheese\\non a flat orange background.\\nAnd this is starting to look okay,\\nbut I wasn't really looking for a little plate or a tray,\\nit has to be simpler.\\nThis is a lot better,\\nbut I don't like the fact that this area is flat\\nand these areas only have the holes.\\nSo what you can do\\nis you can always scroll down the list of options,\\nclick the All option inside of Effects,\\nand then go all the way down until you see Simple.\\n\\nIf you click Simple, it will add that here.\\nI can go ahead and choose Generate to generate something\\nthat looks a little bit more like this.\\nNow I have to say I like this one\\nand I also like this one very much.\\nNow what you can do now is you can use that\\nas a style reference.\\nSo remember a style reference\\nis something that you can apply here in this image\\nby uploading an image yourself.\\nBut you can also feed the style reference option\\nby taking an existing result,\\nclicking the pencil icon\\nand then choosing Use as style reference.\\n\\nSo now this is being loaded up here\\ninstead of this style reference option.\\nNow what I can do now is I can go ahead\\nand create the final prompt.\\nSo I'm just going to get rid of the original prompt.\\nNotice that the star reference was added by the way,\\nand I'm still using the simple option.\\nNow I'm going to go ahead and type in the word CHEESE,\\nI will use all caps for that one,\\nthe word CHEESE written in cheese\\non a flat orange background.\\n\\nAnd I'm not going to hit Enter just yet\\nbecause I have to go into my Finder window,\\nor Explore if you're a Windows user.\\nAnd I'm going to go ahead,\\nI'm going to make sure that I'm going to upload\\nmy cheese structure reference.\\nSo I'm going to scroll up here,\\nI'm going to drag and drop that structure reference here\\ninto the structure option and choose Continue.\\nNow, you can also just click the upload image option\\nif you're not really used\\nto dragging and dropping elements in.\\nBut what's important here\\nis that I do crank up the strength\\nand then secondly that I do align the aspect ratios.\\n\\nRemember, the structure reference\\nis using a wide screen version,\\na wide screen aspect ratio,\\nwhich means I have to match that\\nto the prompt I'm generating now.\\nSo again, widescreen aspect ratio matches the structure,\\nthe structure reference tells Firefly\\nwhat the shape looks like,\\nand then the style reference is telling Firefly\\nwhat material needs to be used\\nand what the style looks like.\\nLet's choose Generate,\\nand let's take a look at a few of these very first examples.\\n\\nNow, the beauty of this is that I can always go back\\nand change the structure reference,\\nI can update my style reference,\\nand I can also update my prompt\\nand keep generating until I find the image\\nthat I am looking for.\\nAnd this is the result,\\nand I have to say I really like this one.\\nIt actually has some of the holes here\\nat the front of the cheese word.\\nAnd it's actually also really taking in\\nthe look and feel of the font,\\nlike it has really done its best to try and find an image\\nthat does really respect what that font really looks like.\\nAnd this is a technique that you can actually reuse\\non multiple occasions as long as you have a simple reference\\nto the texture you want,\\nand if you have a clear structure reference\\nas to what kind of text or other shape you want to fill.\\n\\nSo let's look at another example here.\\nSo if I go back here in the exercises\\nand go back to the previous chapter,\\nthis is exactly how I built this image\\nwith the folded towels spelling out the word dry.\\nAnd if I look at some of the exercises here\\nin the current chapter,\\nthere is a folder called other example.\\nAnd here I have taken this very simple rendering\\nof a salmon filet,\\nand I've applied that using the exact same technique\\nto spell out the word sushi,\\nand this is what you get.\\n\\nSo you can actually reuse this to do anything you want,\\nany food produce,\\nyou can write spaghetti in actual spaghetti.\\nThis can be flowers, it can be wood,\\nit can be any texture that you want,\\nit all follows the same principle.\\nSo again, step one is generating structure reference,\\nstep two is the style reference,\\nand step three is just generating and enjoying the results.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5960180\",\"duration\":331,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using Illustrator

[Instructor] Let's talk about the importance\\nof Adobe Illustrator when building Structure References.\\nLet's take a look at this specific example.\\nSo here I typed in, \\\"birthday cake with 2 layers of cake,\\n10 burning candles, and the words happy birthday,\\nwritten on the side on a bright pink background.\\\"\\nNow there is a lot going on here in this particular prompt.\\nNow if I look at the examples and the results,\\nI'm not really getting what I was hoping for.\\nNow, clearly there are more candles here in this image\\nthan I have here in this image.\\n\\nIs this one layer of cake\\nor are there multiple layers of cake here?\\nI'm not quite sure, so the structure is very different.\\nThe pink background is not that bright,\\nand I don't have the words, Happy Birthday,\\nwritten on the cake anywhere,\\nit just seems to sit on top of everything.\\nNow don't get me wrong, this cake looks absolutely amazing,\\nbut I had something completely different in mind.\\nAnd this is one of those more complex scenarios\\nwhere Adobe Illustrator can really help you to create\\nthat reference that Firefly can help and understand.\\n\\nNow, we've used these Structure References in the past\\nwith just simple black text on a white background.\\nBut if I go here and take a look at my project files\\nand open up birthday or bday.ai,\\nthen you will see that this looks a lot more complex.\\nAnd this is something that you can actually do,\\nand I do really encourage you to put in the effort to try\\nand build that specific Structure Reference.\\nSo here I have already taken into account the fact\\nthat I am looking at a portrait image,\\nso the resolution matches,\\nand I have created two very clear layers of cake.\\n\\nAnd then I have the words Happy birthday.\\nThis is all live text.\\nI'm using a font called Handsome Pro Bold.\\nI even applied a slight warp effect to it to wrap it more\\naround the actual cake.\\nAnd I've also positioned 10 candles on the cake itself.\\nSo I want to decide exactly\\nwhere these candles are going to be,\\nand obviously they have to be lit as well.\\nThis is kind of the level of detail that you can go into.\\nNow, you can refine this as much as you can,\\nbut if this is enough just to get the overall look\\nand feel of the perspective\\nand how much in focus this cake really is\\nand where the Happy Birthday text is located,\\nthen you can already go ahead\\nand use this as a Structure Reference.\\n\\nNow, I have already gone ahead\\nand saved that Structure Reference,\\nwhich is here, it's called Bday.jpeg,\\nand this is what it looks like.\\nNow, notice that the cake was also cut off at the edge\\nwhere the artboard ends,\\nand that is simply because I used\\nthe function Use Artboards as part\\nof the save command here, which is something\\nthat you already learned a couple of videos ago.\\nSo what you can do now is you can actually go ahead\\nand you can now drag and drop in that reference\\ndirectly into Firefly as part of the structure.\\n\\nI'm going to go ahead and now increase the Strength Slider.\\nI'm just going to update that specific prompt\\nand this is the result that I'm getting.\\nSo if you look at this,\\nnow, this looks something that is really respecting\\nthe look and feel of the cake itself.\\nThe candles are in the same position, they're all lit.\\nI have the layers I'm looking for,\\nand it's actually reusing the same look and feel of the font\\nthat I had inside of Adobe Illustrator.\\nSo this is kind of how far you can go into these details.\\n\\nNow let's take a look at another example.\\nSo I built this ping image as well,\\nand this is an idea I had,\\nbecause I was recently rewatching a very specific movie,\\nwhich is, \\\"Fight Club.\\\"\\nAnd the, \\\"Fight Club,\\\" promotion\\nhad this really nice graphic of a soap bar\\nthat had the words, \\\"Fight Club,\\\" engraved in it.\\nAnd I was trying to recreate\\nthat using, \\\"Firefly Club,\\\" instead.\\nSo this is my Structure Reference.\\nSo again, very simple soap bar.\\nI have the text engraving,\\nand then I've got a few blobs,\\nwhich is actually representing foam.\\n\\nAnd so what I can do now is I can actually\\nreuse the same technique that I applied\\nin the previous video with the cheese.\\nSo I used this as a style input.\\nAgain, I have some foam here,\\nI've got a lot of bubbles going on,\\nand this is the over look and feel that I want to go for.\\nAnd the end result, combining everything together\\nand then expanding the image was this,\\nwhere I have the, \\\"Firefly Club,\\\" now,\\nand it's exactly using that Structure Reference\\nthat I had before.\\n\\nLet me click and show you this one.\\nSo this is the Structure Reference\\nand this is what it looked like.\\nSo again, there's a lot of bubbles here on the top left\\nand there's a little bit here overlapping with the text\\nand you have the exact same thing,\\na lot of bubbles in the top left.\\nAnd I have the other bubbles here in the exact same areas\\nthat the Structure Reference has basically designed.\\nSo in a nutshell, just be sure to use Adobe Illustrator\\nand then use more complex Structure References\\nby simply drawing out the entire scene.\\n\\nIt is worth your time, believe me.\\nAnd then combine that with your Style Reference,\\nand then you can end up with the image you're looking for.\\nAnd this is something that I would have probably told\\nthat was impossible to make in just seven minutes\\nabout a year ago, but this is how quickly\\nthis technology is now evolving\\nand it's all available at your fingertips.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5956286\",\"duration\":341,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Generating for blending

[Narrator] Let me show you how to combine blending modes\\nwith Adobe Firefly prompts.\\nHere in Photoshop, I have this file open, snow-start.psd.\\nThis is a basic landscape,\\nbut I would like to add a little bit of snow.\\nNow I could potentially just make\\na selection of the canvas, type in snow,\\nand hopefully I am then going to see\\nthat snow is being added.\\nUnfortunately, that is not how it works\\nand Firefly is going to replace the original landscape\\nwith something completely different.\\nIn other words, I need a way\\nto generate snow on a separate layer\\nthat I can then independently maneuver\\nand manipulate across my scene.\\n\\nAnd blending modes is the way to do that.\\nNow to get started, I need to generate an image of snowfall.\\nTo do that, I could potentially just leave Photoshop\\nand go into the Adobe Firefly webpage.\\nOr since I'm using Photoshop (Beta), I can just come in here\\nand click this button, click Generate Image,\\nand then type in the prompt directly in here.\\nI'm going to type in something like distant snow fall,\\nisolated on a black background.\\n\\nI'm going to go ahead and click Photo\\nand I'm going to choose Generate.\\nNow the advantage of doing this in Photoshop\\nis that it is going to generate an image that's going\\nto match the entire canvas size of my project.\\nNow you do have more control if you leave Photoshop\\nand go into the Adobe Firefly webpage.\\nHowever, for this purpose, I'm actually quite happy\\njust to stay in Photoshop and this is the result.\\nI do have distant snowfall\\nand I have it isolated on a black background.\\nI have three variations, this one, that one, and this one.\\n\\nAnd I have to now decide which one I like best.\\nSo you have to look at the size of the snowflakes,\\nwind direction, perspective, and a few other things.\\nNow there's a lot of movement happening on this one,\\nso maybe I'm going to go with this one here.\\nSo to blend the snow, simply change the blending mode\\nfrom normal to screen, which is going to get\\nrid of all of the black.\\nNow if you want to blend it in a little bit further,\\nyou can now also start\\nto apply different filters and settings.\\nFor example, I can go up to the image menu,\\nchoose Adjustments, and then choose Curves,\\nwhich is then going to attach that to my layer\\nbecause this is acting as a smart object.\\n\\nI'm just going to drag in this point a little bit further\\nand I might actually click to add a point\\nand drag that down.\\nThis is going to reduce the size\\nof some of these snowflakes here.\\nLet me just press OK\\nand that's going to add that directly to my layer.\\nI'm also going to go back to the Image menu,\\nchoose Adjustments again.\\nI'm going to go back and choose Color Balance.\\nSo Color Balance is over here.\\nAnd I'm just going to increase the cyan a little bit here,\\nwhich is going to colorize the snowflakes\\nand make it match the background tone a little bit better\\nbecause it's not perfect white.\\n\\nLet's choose OK and there we go.\\nNow these are the basics.\\nSo you generate but while asking Firefly\\nto add a black background,\\nwhich makes you use Screen, maybe a white background\\nwhere you can use multiply,\\nor maybe even a neutral gray background\\nwhere you can use something like overlay\\nand you can actually take this\\nto the next level if you want as well.\\nYou can, for example, also start\\nto apply different types of filters.\\nSo if you go up to the Filter menu\\nand then choose Blur Gallery\\nand then choose Iris Blur, just to name one filter,\\nyou can actually start to play around\\nwith different filters as you see fit.\\n\\nSo let's quickly do this.\\nI'm going to quickly drag this open\\nand I'm not going to have an effect that's that strong.\\nLet's quickly reduce the size of this blur amount here,\\njust 8 pixels for now, choose OK,\\nand this is now applying that same filter,\\nso it gives me a little bit more,\\na sense of depth basically.\\nNow the interesting thing about this\\nis that every single thing I've just done is live,\\nwhich means that if you go back and you change your mind\\nand you want to have different snow,\\nit is going to just apply that directly into your scene,\\nwhich is really, really cool.\\n\\nLet me show you another example\\nthat's a little bit more advanced.\\nSo in the Project folder you will also see this one\\ncalled snow-end.psd.\\nNow this one is a little bit more refined\\nand this basically has one smart object\\nto which I applied a blur effect as well,\\nwhich looks like this.\\nAnd it's also blurring the actual trees.\\nSo I do have that sense of depth.\\nLet me show you how I did that.\\nI'm going to double-click this smart object\\nand you can see that, let's press OK,\\nthat I have actually duplicated multiple layers\\nthat all prompt for snow and they have\\ndifferent masks applied and different settings.\\n\\nAnd basically if you look at these layers,\\nI have a smaller version of the layer\\nin the back with smaller snow.\\nI have mid-size snow in a second layer\\nand I have the actual snow here in the front layer.\\nAnd this is giving me this sense of depth\\nwhere the snow is bigger in the foreground\\nand there is more snow,\\nand it is smaller here in the background,\\nsimply by moving these different layers\\nand manipulating them by just choosing different variations.\\nAnd then if you change all of that,\\nand if you merge that into a smart object,\\nwhich I'm just going to close for now,\\nthen you will get something like this.\\n\\nSo you can actually go multiple layers deep\\nby using and prompting and having these blending modes\\nand smart objects all combined to create\\nsomething that looks quite complex,\\nbut still gives you a ton of control\\nover your entire project.\\nSo here we have it.\\nThis is how you prompt for blending.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5961139\",\"duration\":311,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using AI to write

[Instructor] What if you want to recreate\\na very particular image,\\nbut you're not quite sure where to begin\\nwith the prompt description?\\nLet me show you an example.\\nSo here inside of the project folder, I have this image,\\nand this is just a normal stock image.\\nIt was downloaded from Adobe Stock,\\nand I would like to use the same look\\nand feel of this image to try and recreate this scene,\\nbut if I do this through a prompt,\\nthen I have a way to edit the prompt\\nand have more control over the narrative.\\nSo where do you begin?\\nThe fact that it's a girl, she's wearing glasses,\\nthe color theme that's going on, the headphones,\\nthe clothing she's wearing, her hands positioning,\\nthis is a lot of work.\\n\\nSo what you can do instead is you can use other AI systems\\nto generate that prompt for you\\nto get your Firefly experience kickstarted.\\nAnd what I've done is I've actually gone ahead\\nand I have uploaded that image into ChatGPT,\\nand I've asked ChatGPT, \\\"Can you describe the image attached\\nin maximum five sentences?\\\"\\nAnd this is the information that I got back.\\nNow, if you don't have a paid version of ChatGPT,\\nwhich is required here, by the way,\\nif you want to upload images, then fear not,\\nbecause I have actually gone ahead,\\nand I have saved the prompt as prompt.rtf\\ninside of the project folder,\\nso you can just go ahead and just select the prompt,\\ncopy that by pressing Command + C\\nor Control + C on the keyboard,\\nand then heading into Firefly,\\nand then pasting that into the text-to-image feature\\nto kickstart the first prompt experience.\\n\\nNow, based on this, Firefly is now going\\nto generate an image that is a young woman\\nwearing large, overhead headphones.\\nIt's going to talk about the scene,\\nit's going to talk about the fact that there is a mix\\nof blue and red tones in the image, et cetera.\\nSo this is the first step.\\nNow, this is pretty good,\\neven though this is definitely not blue and red,\\nit's a bit more orangey,\\nbut we can just go ahead and start to regenerate\\nthese prompts until I find something\\nI'm going to keep working with.\\n\\nNow, this is just the first step in the prompting process.\\nSo what I can do afterwards is I can actually\\nalso reuse the same image to also define the pose\\nof this woman specifically.\\nSo let's say, for example, that I'm going to go back here\\ninto the Finder window,\\nand I'm going to take the original image, as this one,\\nI'm going to go in and just drop this in\\nas a structure reference.\\nI'll choose Continue,\\nand I'm going to increase the Strength slider all the way.\\nBefore I choose Generate,\\nI might actually just switch this\\nto a landscape orientation as well,\\nand then choose Generate,\\nand again, it's going to do the exact same thing.\\n\\nIt's going to use the same structure reference\\nto try and recreate that look and feel.\\nNow, you can even reimport the exact same image\\nas a style reference as well.\\nThat is completely up to you.\\nSo now, it is only basing on the structure reference\\nand what the description basically is.\\nIf you also want to kind of duplicate\\nthe very dark blue and red hues,\\nthen that is absolutely fine,\\nbut you can also scroll down here,\\nand you can also set additional settings.\\n\\nFor example, you can say that this should be a harsh light,\\nor there should be a shallow depth of field,\\nand then choose Generate,\\nand that's going to allow you just to add more depth,\\nand add more control over your prompt experience.\\nNow, the moment you have found something that you do like,\\nand something that you do want to use inside\\nof this type of prompting here,\\nyou can always come in and just change some of these words\\ninside the prompt itself.\\nI have to say, I'm actually not really happy\\nwith the harsh light setting.\\n\\nI'm just going to go ahead and just choose something\\nlike Studio Light, and let's try this again.\\nSometimes you get something that's a lot better\\nthan what you expected,\\nand sometimes it goes into the opposite direction,\\nand that was one of those moments,\\nso let's just give this a few more seconds\\nand see what this does.\\nOkay, cool, so let's say, for example,\\nthat I'm going to use this look and feel.\\nI'm kind of happy with that.\\nLet's change the mix.\\nLet's change the mix to something\\nlike green and orange tones.\\nI'm going to hit Enter or Return just to reuse everything\\nI had before,\\nbut just changing the light source itself.\\n\\nThat takes a few seconds.\\nThere we go, and now, I have something\\nthat is based on what I have before,\\nbut it is now changing the lighting.\\nLet me show you another example.\\nSo I spent a few more minutes on this,\\nand so, this here inside the project folder,\\nthis was the original image,\\nand I have gone ahead, and I've created this version\\nbased on that,\\nso again, before and after.\\nAnd so, again, I have the glasses,\\nI have the same look and feel,\\nand I was able to selectively choose what color theme\\nwas going on in this image.\\n\\nSo the next time you find yourself stuck,\\nhaving to write an enormous prompt with a lot of detail,\\njust use other AI systems to do that work for you,\\nand it's going to often do a very good job in that as a result.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

[Instructor] Let's explore a technique that allows you\\nto greatly increase the quality of your image compositions,\\nespecially the ones that use hair, fur, grass,\\nor any type of complex selection to begin with.\\nLet me show you what we're going to be doing.\\nHere in this example, I'm going to take this image here,\\nwhich is girl.psd.\\nI want to remove the background,\\nand I'm going to place that here inside\\nof composition-start.psd.\\nNow, obviously, looking at the source material we have,\\nthis is going to be a very complex selection,\\nand I have to say I'm a little bit nervous about this one,\\nbecause I'm not quite sure if my Photoshop skills\\nare good enough to turn this into a nice looking composition\\nwhere you don't even see the fact that this was cut out\\nof a different background.\\n\\nNow, luckily, we have Adobe Firefly to the rescue,\\nand that is going to be the deciding factor\\nfor the quality of your image compositions.\\nLet's get started.\\nNow, first of all, I'm going to go ahead\\nand just remove the background from this image,\\nand we'll do that by simply clicking\\nthe Remove Background option at the bottom of the screen.\\nNow, that is going to generate a layer mask\\nthat gets applied to the image.\\nIf I zoom into the image, you might say\\nthat this looks pretty good,\\nbut obviously, I'm not seeing a background anymore,\\nso I'm not quite sure how this is going to blend\\ninto a new background.\\n\\nAnyway, that is nothing to worry about.\\nNow, let's just quickly import this into composition-start.\\nTo do that, I'm going to use the Move tool.\\nI'm going to drag this image here on the tab, wait,\\nwhen it switches to this composition,\\ndrag the cursor inwards, and let go on the canvas,\\nand this is how you drag and drop in different layers\\nfrom different files.\\nNow, the perspective is not too bad, I have to say.\\n\\nHowever, if I zoom in, look at the quality here,\\nthis does not look amazing.\\nNow, you can clearly see that I have these remnants\\nof the old background that came along for the ride.\\nSo how do you fix this?\\nThe main conclusion that everybody is now drawing\\nis that this is all due to your selection skills.\\nSo clearly, you chose the wrong selection tool,\\nselection technique.\\nThis is impossible to clean up.\\nFortunately for us, we can use generative AI\\nto fix this for us.\\n\\nNow, let's zoom out a little bit.\\nLet's center the work area, which is the hair,\\nand I'm going to go ahead and choose the Lasso tool.\\nAnd with the Lasso tool, I'm going to select the area\\nthat I think should be recreated.\\nIn other words, the area where I have these horrible areas\\nof these white plucks of hair.\\nSo let's just get started.\\nI'm going to go ahead and use the Lasso tool.\\nI'm going to start, let's say, somewhere here.\\nI'm just going to drag in,\\njust to try and capture all these areas of the hair.\\n\\nKeep in mind if you don't select it,\\nFirefly will not change it,\\nso whatever you select here,\\nwhatever you include or exclude from the selection\\nis something that you're giving to Firefly\\nto work on and then change.\\nI'm going to go ahead and just go all the way back like so,\\nand then let go.\\nSo this is more or less the selection\\nthat I would like to work with.\\nNow, to fix this, simply click Generative Fill,\\nand then click Generate again,\\nand let's see what Firefly is going to do with that selection\\nbased on the hair and the background.\\n\\nSo we're basically asking it to recreate this texture\\nwith that background.\\nSo it is going to flatten both,\\nbut it's going to blend it in a lot better.\\nNow, this is what I'm getting.\\nThis is the first result, second result, not too bad.\\nThird result, it's a bit flat.\\nI mean, she had, like, a lot of curly hair going on.\\nSo if you're not quite happy with these results,\\nsimply use the Prompt here inside of the Properties panel,\\nand type in, curly hair, and then type in Enter\\nor Return to confirm.\\n\\nAnd then we're going to be reusing that same selection\\nwith the prompt, curly hair, in combination\\nwith the layer that was currently selected.\\nSo let's see what that's going to give us.\\nThis looks a lot better.\\nNow, the hair looks a lot more fuzzy.\\nFirst, second, and third.\\nI like this one, there's a lot of curls going on,\\nand now, you can see that, clearly,\\nthis has now created all these different textures\\nin the hair directly inside of Adobe Photoshop.\\n\\nAnd you can keep experimenting as much as you want\\nto get different versions of this,\\nbut when it comes to blending in the hair\\ninto the background,\\nyou no longer see that you are playing around\\nwith different versions and different results.\\nAgain, you can always go back and choose the one\\nthat you like best,\\nand then you can always go in and just delete the versions\\nthat you didn't quite like,\\nor you can even go back and you can also\\njust click this option that says Enhance\\nto enhance the detail of the version\\nthat was generated for you just to give it\\na little bit more detail and a little bit more sharpness.\\n\\nAnd that's it, this is how simple it is\\nto blend in different elements into a composition.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5959181\",\"duration\":344,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using opacity in

[Instructor] As you know,\\nAdobe Generative Fill in Photoshop\\nis a selection-based feature\\nwhere you use any of the available selection tools\\nin Photoshop to select an area\\nand then ask Firefly to generate something.\\nBut keep in mind that selections\\ncan also have an opacity value.\\nSo this means that you can have semi-transparent selections\\nin Photoshop as well.\\nAnd this is a principle that goes back\\nto the foundation of the program.\\nNow, we often see these semi-transparent selections\\nas part of a layer mask, for example,\\nwhere some areas are not pure white\\nand they're also not pure black,\\nthey're actually a tone of gray instead.\\n\\nBut how do you change the opacity of a selection?\\nAnd more importantly,\\nhow does that correspond to Adobe Firefly?\\nNow let me show you how that works.\\nSo here in Photoshop, I have opened up fish-start.phd,\\nand this is a Firefly-generated image\\nthat features a little river\\nwhere I would like to add some fish to the water.\\nNow, if I were to go ahead here\\nand then choose the normal rectangular marquee tool\\nand then draw a selection,\\nthen I have this area selected for 100%,\\nand the area around the selection is excluded,\\nthere's like 0% opacity here.\\n\\nSo this is the unselected area\\nwhile this is the selected area.\\nSo again, this is just very, very basic Photoshop.\\nNow, you can also make selections using quick mask mode.\\nSo what you can do is you can actually use quick mask mode\\nby using this little button here,\\nit looks a little bit like the European flag,\\nof course, that's coming from a European.\\nIf you double click that option,\\nthen you can also choose to explain to Photoshop\\nhow you want the quick mask to function.\\nSo for example, by default I believe\\nit is set to masked areas.\\n\\nI like to set this to selected areas.\\nI'm going to choose OK just to configure this\\nbefore we get started, I'll choose OK.\\nAnd when this is active, so when you have this icon here,\\nyou can choose for example, the brush tool\\nand then use a black color just to brush something like so.\\nAnd if you then click this icon again\\nto exit quick mask mode,\\nyou've now selected this area instead.\\nSo you're basically painting with selections.\\nNow I'll just quickly Cmd + D or Ctrl + D to deselect.\\n\\nAnd let's go back to quick mask mode.\\nNow, let's try this out for once.\\nSo let's go back to quick mask mode\\nand let's just paint an area like this, for example.\\nThere we go.\\nAnd I'm going to exit quick mask mode,\\nso I have painted the selection now,\\nand I'm going to choose generative fill,\\nand I'm going to type in a school of fish.\\nNow, two things can happen,\\nI will actually get a school of fish\\nor I might actually get one massive fish.\\n\\nSo we'll see how that's going to go.\\nHappy accidents, that's what we say when this happens.\\nSo I'll see how Firefly interprets the prompt.\\nThere are a lot of fish here. Wow.\\nSo I'll quickly take this one or take this one.\\nNow you can see that these fish\\nare actually on top of the reflection.\\nSee?\\nSo these tails are actually going on top of the selection.\\nSo I don't really have the feeling\\nthat these fish are actually in the water.\\nThey seem to be on top of the surface of the river\\nand not really blended into the background.\\n\\nAnd this is something that's going to cause me\\nnot to believe what's happening in this image.\\nSo let me try something else instead.\\nSo let's just quickly hide this layer,\\nlet's reselect the background layer,\\nlet's go back to quick mask mode,\\nand let's choose the brush tool.\\nBut before we paint with a selection,\\nlet's lower the opacity to let's say 30%, 35%, more or less.\\nIt takes some experimenting.\\n\\nAnd it one go, as in click and drag,\\nand not click and click and clicking, so just one motion,\\njust click and drag to paint out a selection like so.\\nAnd notice that the color's\\na lot lighter than what we had before.\\nWhat I've now done is I've actually now painted\\nwith a 36% opacity selection.\\nNow let's exit quick mask mode. Let's try this again.\\nNow, notice that I don't see a selection,\\nI don't see the marching ants.\\nAnything that goes below 50% in opacity\\nwill no longer show the marching ants.\\n\\nBut the fact that it says generative fill\\ndoes mean that there is a selection, I just cannot see it.\\nSo trust me, it's there.\\nClick generative fill,\\nI'm going to type in a school of fish.\\nLet's try this again. I'll hit Generate.\\nAnd now I am generating something\\nwith a 36% opacity selection,\\nwhich allows Firefly to blend in the result a lot better\\nwhen it is generating a result of this particular prompt.\\n\\nLet's see what this is going to give me.\\nAnd this is looking a lot better.\\nSo now I really feel like these fish are a lot more embedded\\ninto the surface of the water,\\nand the result is just a lot better.\\nI actually have to really try and find the fish in the water\\nbecause they're blended in so well.\\nNow, you can always go back\\nand you can repaint the selection as you see fit.\\nIt's going to go ahead and give you a far superior result\\nwhenever you want something\\nto blend in more into the background.\\nAnd this counts for water,\\nthis might be in an ice surface\\nor anything else where you want to play around\\nwith opacity settings.\\n\\nBut clearly, these look a lot more realistic\\nthan when I had these ones\\nwhere it just seems to be more painted on top\\nof what it was I had before.\\nSo again, something for you to play around with\\nand experiment a little bit more on.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5959180\",\"duration\":293,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Another opacity example\",\"fileName\":\"3387243_en_US_02_03_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"prompt: heavy rain\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":false,\"rawDurationSeconds\":297,\"exerciseFileDisplayText\":\"Exercise Files > Ch 02 > 02-03\",\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"This video shows another example of changing the opacity of a selection in combination with Generative Fill.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":18001173,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\"- [Instructor] Now that you know how to change the opacity\\nof a selection, let's look at another example.\\nHere, inside of Photoshop, I have opened up cat-start.psd,\\nand this is a very simple document.\\nThe only two things I have here are a background image\\nand one Generative Fill layer\\nthat is using a prompt walking cat.\\nSo this is the original image,\\nand this is the image with the cat.\\nNow Firefly has done enough to try\\nand blend the cat in, so it's actually regenerating some\\nof these water drops here in the area\\nof the original selection.\\n\\nBut what's a bit odd is the fact that there seems\\nto be no rain falling in this area of the cat.\\nThere should be water drops here passing by the cat.\\nAnd also given the amount of rain I have in this image,\\nthe cat looks pretty dry.\\nSo I was expecting the fur to be a lot more wet as well.\\nSo how do you fix that?\\nNow, if I were to just use the normal way of working,\\nwhich is just choose a selection method, like for example,\\nthe Rectangular Marquee tool,\\ndrag over selection, and just hit Generative Fill,\\nand then type in something like heavy rain,\\nand then choosing Generate.\\n\\nLet's see how that's going to blend\\nthe newly created heavy rain\\nwith the cat I currently have inside of the selection.\\nSo let's give it a few seconds,\\nand see how that is going to respond to the command.\\nWell, this is not what I wanted.\\nClearly I am getting what I asked for,\\nbut it's not really what I wanted.\\nI want the heavy rain to be blended in with the cat.\\nInstead, I'm just getting more rain.\\nSo I've got this version, that version,\\nand now there's a plant growing there, which is lovely,\\nbut not really what I was looking for.\\n\\nSo let's quickly get rid of that layer. Let's restart this.\\nNow let's try an alternate method using opacity\\nto select the area around the cat.\\nSo for that, I'll go back here.\\nI'll click the little European flag again\\nto enter Quick Mask mode, which does kind\\nof turn into the Japanese flag, let's be honest.\\nBut anyway, let's just continue the exercise.\\nLet's choose the Brush tool,\\nand as an opacity, again, you are free to experiment\\nwith this as much as you want.\\n\\nJust know that the higher the opacity\\nin this particular example,\\nthe bigger the surprise is going to be, just so you know.\\nSo for now, I'm going to start with 40%,\\nand see what kind of a result I'm going to get here.\\nSo with that, just simply drag\\nand continue dragging across the cat.\\nDon't let go, because again, if you click another time,\\nit's going to add another layer of 40%,\\nwhich means that area will be 80%.\\nSo again, just one smooth click and drag.\\nAnd once you have highlighted the area\\nin which you would like to work,\\njust go back and exit Quick Mask mode.\\n\\nYou don't see a selection, but trust me, it is there.\\nClick Generative Fill. Let's try the exact same prompt.\\nLet's type in heavy rain, and then press Enter\\nor Return to see what that's going to do.\\nNow again, I am expecting to find images,\\nor at least start to generate images now,\\nthat feature more water drops\\nin front in this area of the cat,\\nand also, the fur has to be different.\\nAnd so this is exactly what I'm now getting.\\nSo this looks a little bit weird.\\n\\nThere's a bit of a line here.\\nI'm not quite sure where, I've got this version.\\nI've got that version.\\nLet's generate another generation of variations here.\\nThat's a cool thing about Firefly. You can just keep going.\\nNow, what I am seeing as a trend\\nis that the fur is looking a lot more scruffy.\\nIt looks a lot wetter than it was before,\\nand also, I'm generating more water drops in the foreground\\nof this composition.\\nNow this is starting to look a lot better.\\nSo this is one version, maybe not that one.\\nThis is another potential version.\\nSo basically just continue experimenting.\\n\\nBut clearly you can see that now I do have these drops\\nbeing generated on this side of the cat.\\nSo again, you will probably\\nhave different looking variations of this.\\nI have already gone ahead and done a bit more experimenting.\\nSo cat-end.psd looks like this,\\nwhere I just had a lot more splashes,\\nand a very, very similar looking cat,\\nwhich is clearly here with a wet fur.\\nAnd so this is only possible if you're using\\nthese semi-transparent techniques using Quick Mask mode\\nand Generative Fill inside of Adobe Photoshop.\\n\\nSo whenever you have images that feature water,\\nor reflections, or maybe ice,\\nor anything else, be sure to start experimenting\\nwith these opacity settings.\\nThey're not there for every day, I do have to admit that.\\nBut when you do come across one of these projects,\\nit might really save your day,\\nand save you a ton of compositing,\\nand a ton of Photoshop brushwork.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5952434\",\"duration\":342,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Shaping

[Instructor] In the previous videos,\\nyou've learned about the importance\\nof the opacity of a selection,\\nor the semi transparency of a selection.\\nThis video, we're going to be focusing\\non the shape of a selection.\\nNow, let's take a look at this example.\\nHere, I've opened up pencilsstart.psd.\\nAnd this is just a very basic image of a desk.\\nNow, don't ask me why there are Christmas decorations\\nhere on the desk, but they are simply there.\\nNow, let's take a look at the layer structure.\\n\\nThere's one layer here called latte art.\\nI'll quickly just hide the layer\\nto show you what the original looked like.\\nSo we had coffee, but now we have a cappuccino.\\nThe second one is sunglasses.\\nSo I'm quickly going to hide that one.\\nSo this was the original and this is what I added.\\nNow keep in mind that whenever you make a selection\\nof an area and then you use Gen Fill,\\nthen you're basically giving that area to Firefly,\\nand it will use that area to work inside of it\\nand then generate whatever it is that you want to generate.\\n\\nSo let's take a look at the selection of the sunglasses.\\nNow, I didn't paint the shape of a sunglasses\\nand then use Gen Fill, I created a selection.\\nNow I'm going to press and hold down the Option\\nor Alt key on the keyboard,\\nand I'm going to click the layer mask here for the sunglasses,\\nand that's going to visualize what that selection looked like.\\nThis is the selection that I generated,\\nand I basically told Firefly,\\n\\\"Within the boundaries of this selection,\\nplease generate sunglasses.\\\"\\nAnd because I rotated my selection this way,\\nit has generated sunglasses that are also rotated that way.\\n\\nSo I'll quickly just Option\\nor Alt click the layer mask again to exit this mode.\\nSo you can see that this is how I orchestrated\\nthe exact placement of those sunglasses.\\nSo Firefly didn't try and squeeze in horizontal sunglasses\\nor vertical sunglasses inside of that selection.\\nIt knew it had to pivot the sunglasses with it.\\nNow, let's try this again.\\nSo if I want to generate a few coloring pencils,\\nI could, for example, just use the rectangular marquee tool,\\ndrag a very large area, and then choose Gen Fill\\nand type in something like,\\n\\\"coloring pencils,\\\"\\nand I'll hit okay.\\n\\nNow, the problem with that is the following.\\nFirst of all, I'm selecting a massive area of the image.\\nI only want to generate just a few pencils,\\nwhich means I don't want Firefly to touch\\nany of the surrounding wood texture,\\nbut now I'm getting a whole ton of pencils,\\nwhile actually I was just looking\\nto create like three or four.\\nBut how should they be positioned?\\nThat's all very complicated,\\nso how do you do something like that?\\nWell, let's delete the layer.\\n\\nInstead, let's go back to quick mask mode,\\nand let's use the brush tool to paint the selection\\nfor my pencils.\\nI'm going to go ahead and go back into brush tool.\\nNow make sure you have 100% opacity for this one.\\nSo again, crank up the slide to 100%.\\nAnd I'm going to go with a brush that's about this big,\\nso I have about 300 in radius.\\nAnd I'm going to use basic brushing techniques\\nto try and explain to Firefly\\nwhere these pencils should be located.\\n\\nSo I'm going to go ahead and just move the cursor here.\\nI'm going to click once,\\nso just click,\\nand that's my first selection.\\nNow I'm going to move the cursor here.\\nI'm going to hold down the Shift key,\\nI'm going to click again.\\nAnd that's going to connect these two brush strokes.\\nThis is basic Photoshop.\\nNow, let's try this again.\\nSo let's try one once more here.\\nDon't press down anything, just a normal click.\\nClick.\\nAgain, let's press and hold down the Shift key.\\nAnd let's click again.\\n\\nLet's try this again.\\nNormal click,\\nand then hold down Shift key, click again.\\nAnd then maybe one more here.\\nAnd then hold down the Shift and click again.\\nSo this is now my selection.\\nSo I'm basically trying to orchestrate and direct Firefly\\nwhere and how these pencils should be oriented\\non this particular image.\\nLet's exit quick mask mode.\\nThis is my selection.\\nAnd then choose Gen Fill,\\nand then type in \\\"coloring pencils,\\\"\\nand then hit enter or return.\\n\\nSo normally, Firefly should be smart enough\\nto realize that it should create one coloring pencil\\ninside of every selection.\\nIf it's creating more,\\nthen I have to make my selection smaller next time.\\nSo let's see what this is going to give me.\\nAnd there we have it.\\nWe have our coloring pencils.\\nAnd so if I look at the different variations here,\\nI actually have one version\\nwhere it did think that the selection was wide enough\\nto fit two different pencils, which is fine.\\nThat's completely on me.\\n\\nAnd I have one other version like so.\\nAnd it just took a random variety of colors,\\nwhich is something I can really appreciate.\\nBut obviously, if you do want\\nto change these particular colors,\\nthen you can always specify that in the prompt,\\nor you can always go back into these colors\\nand then use normal Photoshop scales\\njust to update what these pencils actually look like.\\nSo again, the importance of selections is\\nit helps you to first orchestrate\\nand position where you want the objects to be.\\nAnd also, every single area that you did not select\\nas part of your action,\\nwill remain untouched in your composition.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

[Instructor] Let's talk about the importance of layers\\nand layer visibility when using generative fill\\nhere inside of Adobe Photoshop.\\nSo you might recognize this scene\\nwhere I'm reusing the same desk, I took away the pencils\\nand I added some flowers instead.\\nAnd I want to add one more element, but there's a problem.\\nLet me show you what this is going to look like.\\nIf I want to make a selection like so,\\nand then generate a coffee stain, I'll choose gen fill.\\nI'll type coffee stain and hit okay.\\n\\nIt is going to generate a coffee stain on the wood.\\nNow the problem with that\\nis that with every selection you make\\nand every generative fill command that you apply,\\nPhotoshop will always flatten that area\\nof the selection in your composition.\\nWhich means that the coffee stains I have like this one\\nor that one, I mean these look great,\\nbut if I want to move the coffee stain to this position\\nand simply use the move tool, you will see\\nwhat the problem is.\\nAnd this is normal behavior.\\n\\nNow I'll undo.\\nWhat if I generate a coffee stain\\non a white background?\\nSo let's think back to the other things\\nthat we've learned in these lessons\\nwhere we can generate something\\non a particular background color,\\nallowing me to blend that color using blending modes.\\nOkay, so in this case, I would love to generate\\na coffee stain on a flat white surface.\\nAnd that will allow me to use a blending mode like multiply\\nto get rid of the white background, allowing me\\nto move the stain to any position in my composition.\\n\\nLet's give that a go.\\nand let's reselect the area.\\nThere we go, and let's type in,\\n\\\"Coffee stain on a flat white background.\\\"\\nAnd let's choose okay,\\nand now let's see what that's going to give me.\\nNow I'm expecting literally that,\\nI'm really expecting a coffee stain\\non a flat white background,\\nso I can now use multiply and I'm done.\\n\\nBut let's take a look at what that's going to give me.\\nNow, what I'm getting now is, this is really weird,\\ndifferent types of coffee stains\\nwhere if I move them, I have the same problem.\\nSo Firefly is not listening to me.\\nThe reason Firefly is not listening is because Firefly\\nis always going to look at the composition\\nand all the layers in your Photoshop document,\\nand it's going to base the result on those layers as well.\\nSo that is really a factor that gen fill\\nor generative fill is taking into consideration.\\n\\nBut that is currently messing up\\nwhatever it is I'm doing here.\\nSo let's quickly just delete the layer.\\nLet's try something else.\\nLet's hide everything by clicking all the I icons.\\nThen I'm going to take my same selection tool,\\ndraw more or less the same shape I wanted.\\nAnd now with nothing active in this layer stack,\\nlet's type in what I want.\\nCoffee stain on a flat white background,\\nand let's hit enter or return,\\nand see what that's going to give me.\\n\\nNow currently I have removed all context of this composition\\nfrom Firefly as it is now generating\\nthe content from scratch.\\nAnd now I am getting these coffee stains,\\ntaken out of their context,\\nbecause I have not given any context,\\n'cause I've hidden that from Firefly.\\nAnd now I can reactivate all elements.\\nI can change the blending mode to multiply.\\nI have my coffee stain, it might be a little bit big.\\n\\nI can actually scale this down a little bit.\\nAnd now I am free to move the coffee stain anywhere I want.\\nI can rotate it, I can scale it,\\nI can do whatever I want with this.\\nAnd now I have more control.\\nAnd the only way this was possible is to just have Firefly\\nonly focus on the words\\nand not the circumstances in which it has to create\\nthat specific prompt.\\nAnd this is a very valuable lesson,\\nhas been a very valuable lesson to myself as well,\\nas I was generating different images, different

[Instructor] Let's take a look at how you can blend images\\ntogether using Adobe Firefly.\\nAnd this is something where you can kind of stitch\\nimages together for building panoramas\\nor just making more complex compositions all together.\\nAnd it's all based on GenAI technology,\\nwhich means it can just generate more and new content\\non the transition lines.\\nIt's a little bit similar to what we've done before\\nwhere we have the image of the girl in the coffee shop\\ntaking a selfie and we had to blend in\\nthe hair a lot better.\\n\\nNow let's take a look at this example.\\nThis is blending_start.psd, and I have one image here\\non the left-hand side, and I have one image here\\non the right hand side.\\nNow the grassy fields look a little bit similar.\\nThe perspective seems to match up.\\nThe transition between the left and the right image\\ncould use a little bit of work.\\nAnd this is where Firefly comes in.\\nSo what we're going to be doing here is we are going to\\njust position these both images next to one another,\\nand then we just use selection tools\\nto start blending everything in.\\n\\nSo I'm going to choose something like the lasso tool,\\nand I'm just going to go ahead and just make a selection\\nlike so, and make sure you have a lot of overlap\\nbetween the images, which means you're giving Firefly\\na lot of room to work with and to come up with\\nsome sort of a transition between\\nthe left image and the right image.\\nSimply click Generative Fill and then click Generate again\\nto start this process.\\nNow this is now an image one next to the other.\\nIt could be above or below or in the middle of it.\\n\\nSo now I'm just blunting the edges of layers that seem\\nto touch one another while what we had before with the hair\\nwas a scenario where the hair was on top of another layer.\\nWhile I was talking, it actually finished already.\\nSo I got this as a first result,\\nsecond result, third result.\\nI think I like the first one better.\\nThis looks pretty good.\\nAnd so this is how easy it is just to start\\nblending in images.\\nSo I can add as many images as I want.\\nIt's going to continue to blend everything in,\\nwhich is really, really cool.\\n\\nSo I can even come in and now just use the crop tool.\\nI'll hit the Clear option, and I can just go ahead\\nand just use Generative Expand even\\njust to add more image, more sky.\\nLet's do that and let's hit Enter or Return.\\nI'm not going to type in anything just to give it a little bit\\nmore room near the top of this edge.\\nAnd so again, whatever you select as an overlap will be used\\nas room for transition to start to blend\\nfrom one image to the other.\\n\\nSo let's pick this one for example.\\nThis looks great.\\nAnd then if you want, you can always continue\\nwith this composition by, for example,\\nflattening everything and then replacing the sky.\\nSo let me just quickly do that.\\nI'll create a new layer.\\nI'm going to press the shortcut, which is quite complex.\\nIt's Shift + Command + Option + E,\\nor Shift + Control + Alt + E on Windows,\\nwhich is going to merge everything in the current layer.\\nAnd then based on that, you can always optionally\\nchoose Edit, and you can choose Sky Replacement.\\n\\nAnd from there you can just go ahead\\nand choose a different sky.\\nAgain, this is not Firefly, but it is using AI\\nin the background just to create those masks for you.\\nAnd again, you can just experiment\\nand just create these beautiful scenes.\\nOh, this is not too bad.\\nJust select the one you want.\\nClick and drag it, and then choose OK.\\nAnd we have now created a pretty complex\\ncomposition transition, which traditionally would have\\nprobably taken you hours to do using a lot of stock footage\\nand a lot of elbow grease.\\n\\nAnd this is what we've done in just barely two,\\nthree minutes.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5952435\",\"duration\":309,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Expanding

[Instructor] Let's talk about video for a second.\\nUp until now, we've always taken images\\nand we've used all sorts of Firefly capabilities\\nto apply that to images\\nor just generate more images from scratch.\\nNow, it is true that there are Firefly capabilities\\nalready within Adobe Premiere Pro in beta,\\nat least at the time of this recording.\\nBut how can you use video in combination with Firefly\\nhere in Photoshop?\\nWell, let me show you how that works.\\nSo here in Photoshop, I'm currently using video-start.psd,\\nand this features a Smart Object that has\\nan embedded video clip.\\n\\nAnd I've got a few text layers that says:\\nDance like no one is watching.\\nNow, this is actually a video,\\nbut the only way to hit the play button is\\nto access the Timeline panel.\\nGo up to Window and then choose Timeline\\nto activate the Timeline panel.\\nIt looks like this.\\nNow, if you don't have the layers\\nall stretched out like this,\\nyou can just use this slider just to change\\nthat orientation a little bit and just give you\\na little bit more room to look at.\\nNow, I'll just go ahead and just hit the play button,\\nand this is what's happening.\\nSo this is just a cool fella dancing away,\\nand this is the end of clip.\\n\\nNow, this all looks great, but clearly,\\nthis clip is a landscape-oriented video\\nthat I got from Adobe Stock, but I want to be hip.\\nI want to have a vertical video instead,\\nbecause that's what everybody's doing these days\\nfor social media.\\nBut how do I convert this into a vertical video?\\nI could potentially scale the video up,\\nbut that is going to cover the text.\\nThat's not what I want.\\nI just want to have more video.\\nI want to expand what I have.\\nNow, whenever you put your play head anywhere here\\ninside of this timeline,\\nand then use Generative Expand in Photoshop,\\nit will use the current frame\\nas the input for whatever is generated.\\n\\nNow, in my case, there's just a lot of yellow\\nin the background.\\nHowever, if I had a video with different shots\\nand different colors and different scenes,\\nputting the play head to a very specific position\\nand then using Generative Fill is going to allow me\\nto generate an image that matches\\nthat original selection in that original time and space.\\nNow, let's give this a go.\\nI'm going to move the play head all the way back\\nto the beginning.\\nAnd I am going to go use the Rectangular Marquee tool.\\n\\nI'm going to drag a selection that partially overlaps\\nwith the video, just to create a good transition.\\nAnd I'm going to use Generative Fill, and for now,\\nI'm not going to type in anything.\\nI'm just going to choose Generate.\\nAnd that's going to generate a new Generative Fill layer\\nthat sits on top of the video\\nbut just below the other text layers.\\nSo I'll just give it a few seconds and see\\nwhat Photoshop is going to come up with.\\nNow obviously, this is a static image,\\nbut it just overlaps really well with the video.\\n\\nYou can see that this is now adding\\nthe Generative Fill layer, which is a little bit limited.\\nSo I might actually have to take the endpoint\\nand just drag this until it has the same duration\\nof the other layers here.\\nNow, let's give this a go.\\nSo this is the animation I currently have.\\nIf we just choose the background layer\\njust to get rid of the status bar here.\\nAnd you can see that this is now a beautiful transition,\\nand it does really look like this is a vertical video now.\\n\\nNow obviously, this is just whatever Firefly came up with,\\nbut this is not stopping me from simply choosing\\nthat Generative Fill layer, and then,\\nin the Properties, just choosing a different version.\\nSo this is with a different ceiling.\\nThis is a bit more flat.\\nI don't really like this one, to be honest.\\nBut you can just go ahead and add anything you want.\\nFor example, windows, maybe choose Generate.\\nIt's going to generate a few windows for you.\\nIt's going to blend in beautifully with the background here\\nof this image.\\n\\nSo let's give this a few seconds, see what that looks like.\\nSo now I've got something happening here in the background.\\nIt's not quite generating the windows I was looking for,\\nI'll be honest, but it has generated\\na few different variations that are not too bad,\\nincluding a couple of lights.\\nAnd that's something I actually want to try as well.\\nSo you can actually type in something\\nlike: yellow chandelier.\\nAnd then just try and add some more details.\\nBut the cool thing is that you are in the driver's seat.\\nYou're completely in charge of this,\\nand you can choose when the background that you've generated\\nmight overlap too much with the text,\\nremoving some illegibility of the text.\\n\\nBut again, I've got this, I've got that,\\nso there's a lot of cool stuff happening here.\\nAnd again, you have all these different versions\\nto go back to.\\nI'm actually going to choose this one, which I had before.\\nI'm just going to click this option that says Enhance.\\nOh, it says the variation\\nis apparently too small to enhance.\\nAnd in the end, you have the video clip\\nthat you always wanted,\\nready to publish this on social media.\\nSo yes, you can expand video\\nsimply by adding different regions around the video itself.\\nAnd I could've done this on the left, right,\\nor at the bottom.\\n\\nIt's going to work beautifully, as long as it's a flat image.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5959178\",\"duration\":320,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Generating realistic

[Instructor] What makes an image composition realistic?\\nAnd very often the answer is perspective,\\nlight, shadows, and reflections.\\nIf you can get all those different elements correct,\\nthere is a very high probability\\nno one will even notice this was a photo composition.\\nBut how do you create these different elements?\\nAnd that's where Firefly comes in.\\nHere in Photoshop, I've opened up Carstart.psd\\nand this is a very simple image of a landscape,\\nand I imported this car image.\\n\\nSo I cut the car image out from a different image,\\nI actually flipped it horizontally,\\nI add some blur to the tires and the wheels,\\nand I think I got the position correct,\\nand it also has the same perspective.\\nThe only thing I'm missing is a shadow effect,\\nbecause now clearly the car is just hovering\\nover the road and it's not what we want.\\nSo I have to create a realistic looking shadow,\\nand I have a few different options here.\\nNow, I could just brush a shadow,\\nbut I would have to really know where and how\\nI need to brush, what intensity,\\nand how it should blend into the asphalt of the road.\\n\\nI can use maybe other images of shadows.\\nI can kind of superimpose those into the composition,\\nbut everything is just a lot of experimentation\\nand just a lot of work.\\nNow I can use Photoshop and Firefly together\\nto generate these shadows for me really, really quickly.\\nOne of the things that Firefly does need\\nin order to know where the shadow goes\\nis a clear light source.\\nNow, in this case, you can see that there is a clear sun\\nand that there are clear reflections here on the car itself.\\n\\nNow, this is something that's not very outspoken,\\nbut trust me, Firefly needs to have this visual input\\nin order to know in which direction the shadow should go\\nand what the color or the tone of that shadow\\nshould look like, because shadows do have different colors,\\nthey're not neutral gray,\\nand they do blend in with the ground surface as well.\\nNow, on top of that, I do need to have a general idea\\nwhere I want the shadow to be.\\nNow, I am not a complete idiot, so I do have a sense\\nthat if the sun is coming from here,\\nthat the shadow should follow the line of the sun.\\n\\nNow, let's get started.\\nTo quickly do this, I'm just going to use the lasso tool\\nand I'm going to make sure that I am here on the car layer.\\nNow I'm just go ahead and start to drag a selection\\nand I'm cutting into the car just a little bit.\\nAgain, transitions are important, like so,\\nand now I'm just going to go all the way down\\nand then connect that, and then let go.\\nNow, keep in mind that every area that you have selected\\nis an area that you're giving to Firefly,\\nwhich means you are allowing Firefly\\nto change the details of whatever is selected.\\n\\nSo there's a chance that some of the details\\nhere on the rim of the car, or maybe the edge here,\\nmight look a tad different.\\nSo you might have to go back and retouch those.\\nThe only thing that you have to do now\\nis just hit generative fill,\\nand then choose generative fill again.\\nAnd because the light source is so clear,\\nit's so obvious, it should know and pick up\\nthat the shadow is missing on that exact location.\\nWhen it is not generating shadows for you,\\nthen that usually means\\nthat there's no prominent light source\\nthere in the composition to work with.\\n\\nOkay, this is the first result.\\nSecond result, there's a line being added,\\nso that's new, and there's a third one.\\nLet's try this again.\\nLet's do generate once more and see what that does.\\nNow, having said that, I have to say,\\nI have not really seen any bad shadows yet\\nbecause some of the challenges that we have\\nwhen generating realistic shadows\\nis having some of the details in the road\\ncome through the shadow.\\nThis is a very hard one, by the way.\\nSofter, softer, this is not too bad.\\nSo you can actually come in and you can just choose\\nfrom all these different variations now.\\n\\nSo I'm going to go with this one for now\\nand then notice that it does really put in\\nsome of the highlights here of the asphalt.\\nIt's given me a pretty good shadow to work with here,\\nand it is also respecting the light source\\nand the direction in which the shadow is headed.\\nAnd again,\\nyou don't even have to come in and type in shadow.\\nSometimes you can, but again,\\nif the light source is strong enough,\\nit will pick that up for you and will do that automatically.\\nNow, keep in mind that if I just remove\\nor hide the layer for the shadow, it has really changed\\nthe look and feel of the car a little bit.\\n\\nSo the only thing I'm going to come in here now\\nis just select the mask of the gen fill layer,\\nuse the brush tool, and then just choose a smaller brush.\\nAnd I'm just going to use black as a foreground color.\\nI'm just going to come in and just use a slightly softer brush\\njust to brush this area back.\\nI clicked once, I hold down the shift key,\\nand I clicked again.\\nRemember the pencil exercise.\\nIt's the exact same procedure here.\\nJust make sure that you only bring back the mask\\nor hide it where you really want to have\\nthese changes take effect.\\n\\nAnd I think this is a pretty good job.\\nThis really brought back just the shadow\\nand it's leaving the actual car itself alone.\\nThere you go, simple shadow blending\\nin just a handful of minutes.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5952432\",\"duration\":380,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Automating

Let me show you how you can use a gen fill command\\nas part of an automation technique\\nby using actions inside of Adobe Photoshop.\\nNow, normally if you are using Photoshop actions,\\nyou're just selecting, and cropping,\\nand making several adjustments to an image, right?\\nBut now, you can actually start to include\\nthese gen fill commands as part of your action,\\nand this allows you to create a prompt\\nand then reuse that prompt across multiple images.\\nAnd because every single prompt result\\ngives a unique result,\\nyou will get different variations of the same prompt\\nfor every image that you process using that same action.\\n\\nLet me show you how that works.\\nHere in Photoshop, I have 01.jpeg open,\\nwhich is a file that you can find here\\ninside of the input folder.\\nNow, the idea is to, first of all,\\nmake a selection of the subject,\\nand then crop this subject as part of a portrait picture,\\nand then replace the background.\\nAnd I would like to use an action for that.\\nAnd I also want to use a gen fill command.\\nLet me show you how that works.\\nNow, first we have to teach Photoshop\\nwhat the action looks like and what steps it has to repeat.\\n\\nNow, to make that work,\\nmake sure you have the actions panel open.\\nIf you don't have it open,\\ngo up to the window menu and then choose actions.\\nHere at the bottom of the panel,\\nI'm going to click this option here\\nto generate a brand new action.\\nNow let's call this one \\\"portrait snowy landscape,\\\"\\nand let's hit the record button\\nto start recording our steps.\\nNow, first I'm going to go up here,\\nI'm going to choose select, I'm going to choose subject\\nto make a selection of that subject.\\n\\nNow, I'm going to click here to look at the selection options,\\nand I'm going to choose expand selection,\\nand I'm going to choose about 300 pixels.\\nLet's click okay, and now I have expanded the selection.\\nNow, based on that, I would like to crop the image.\\nI'll choose image, and I'll choose crop.\\nAnd now I'm going to deselect\\nby clicking the deselect option here.\\nNow, these are my first steps.\\nMake a selection, expand the selection,\\nand then crop based on that size.\\n\\nSo this is going to give me the same approximate canvas size\\nfor every portrait image\\nthat I will be processing for now on.\\nNow, this is where it gets interesting.\\nFirst, I have to select the subject again,\\nand I have to remove the background,\\nbut I can actually do both things at the same time\\nwhen I'm using the Photoshop beta version.\\nIf you're using the normal version of Photoshop,\\nyou can just use select subject\\nand then invert the selection\\nand then type in the prompt that you want.\\n\\nHere in my scenario, I'm using Photoshop beta,\\nwhich gives me a remove background option,\\nwhich I'm clicking now,\\nand then followed by a generate background option,\\nwhich gives me my prompt, so it's a little bit quicker.\\nNow, type in the prompt that we're looking for.\\nI'm going to type in something very simple\\nlike snowy landscape.\\nLet's go ahead and click generate\\nto generate that first prompt.\\nNow, I will always get three variations\\nbecause this is just a normal prompt,\\nand when I save the document,\\nI kind of have to go for the first version\\nthat Photoshop is giving me.\\n\\nHowever, because I'm choosing to save this now\\nas a PSD file,\\nI can always revisit every individual document\\nand then choose a different version\\nor even generate more alternatives if that is a requirement.\\nNow, while I'm still recording, let's add a save command.\\nI'll choose file, save as,\\nand I'm going to click the output folder, 01.psd is fine,\\nI'll choose save,\\nand then I'm going to click the don't show again\\nfor the maximized compatibility,\\nbecause we always do want that,\\nI'll choose okay, and now I'm going to close the document.\\n\\nNow, we've closed the document,\\nbut know that the action\\nis still recording in the background.\\nThe panel is simply hidden.\\nSo go up to the window menu, choose actions again,\\nand just make sure you click the stop button\\nto stop recording.\\nThis is the action I would like to apply.\\nNow we're going to apply that\\nto every single image I have here in this folder.\\nNow I already have 01.psd,\\nwhich I've now just created as an example.\\nI'm going to go ahead and just delete that one\\nbecause I do want to start off from scratch\\nwith all five of these images.\\n\\nNow, let's get started.\\nGo back to Photoshop and then choose file, automate, batch.\\nFrom here, we can choose the action we want to apply.\\nSo let's quickly go through the list\\nand let's choose the portrait snowy landscape.\\nClick the folder option,\\nand then make sure that you click choose,\\nand make sure that you have the input folder as the target.\\nLet's click choose,\\nand then as the destination, change this to folder as well.\\nClick the choose option\\nand then navigate to the output folder\\nand click choose.\\n\\nNow we are ready to get started.\\nI'm going to go ahead and click the okay button,\\nand Photoshop is going to start with the very first one,\\nwhich is 01.jepg,\\nso it's going through all five images at the same time now,\\nand it's going to give me that result.\\nNow, while it's doing that,\\nknow that if you want to automate this on a far larger scale\\nand you simply don't want to sit around\\nand wait for all of this to happen, one after the other,\\nthere are more advanced ways\\nof automating gen AI capabilities using Firefly.\\nAnd one of the ways you can do this\\nis by using specific APIs\\nand something that Adobe calls Firefly Services,\\nwhich enables you to automate your work\\nusing various Photoshop and Firefly APIs.\\n\\nBut, you have to talk to Adobe\\njust to get that up and running.\\nNow, it's going to go through this entire process, now.\\nI'm going to give us a few seconds for it to finish.\\nOnce this action's complete,\\nwe can go and take a look at the output folder,\\nand this is what we've just created.\\nThis version, we've got this one here,\\nwe've got that one, this one, and that one.\\nSo this is just a great way to incorporate\\nthat gen fill command as part of an action\\nfor automation

[Instructor] You can make some amazing individual images\\nwith Firefly technology.\\nNow just imagine what you can create\\nby combining multiple generated images.\\nWe're going to start exploring compositing\\nor combining images with Firefly and Photoshop\\nin this chapter.\\nWe're going to start with a simple composite\\nso that you can get the hang of it\\nand so that you don't get hung up on Photoshop techniques.\\nBy the way, if you do get stuck\\non any Photoshop basics anywhere in this course,\\nyou can always pop out and look for a solution\\nin another course that I made for LinkedIn Learning,\\ncalled \\\"Learning Photoshop\\\".\\n\\nNow, we're going to start in Firefly\\nto generate the background for our composite.\\nAll we have to do is enter a text prompt into the text\\nto image module in Firefly.\\nYou can do that from right here on the homepage\\nby clicking on this text prompt box\\nand typing in what you want.\\nAnd basically all you're doing is describing the image\\nthat you want Firefly to generate for you.\\nSo I'm going to put in just a few words to start with.\\nCity skyline at night, and I'll click Generate.\\n\\nAnd that takes us over\\nto the controls in the text-to-image module.\\nWhile Firefly is going\\nabout generating four different variations\\nof an image that it thinks is responsive\\nto what I asked for.\\nWell, this is close.\\nIt is a city skyline at night,\\nbut I'd rather have a closer view\\nand I'd rather the background be darker.\\nSo I'm going to try to modify my prompt\\nto better describe what I want.\\nThe more specific and descriptive you can be\\nin your text prompts,\\nthe more likely you are to get\\nthe image you were envisioning from Firefly.\\n\\nSo I'll come down here,\\nand this time I'm going to be a little more specific.\\nI'll leave city skyline at night\\nand I'll add dark blue.\\nYou can add anything from actions\\nto descriptors to locations,\\neven emotions to help Firefly understand\\nwhat you're envisioning.\\nFirefly will also give you some prompt suggestions\\nin this popup,\\nbut I'm going to skip those for now and go with my prompt.\\nNow, before I click the Generate button,\\nI notice that all of these images are square,\\nand that's because by default the aspect ratio\\nis set to square.\\n\\nAnd you can see that over on the right,\\nwhere there are a number of very simple controls\\nthat you can use to give Firefly more information\\nabout what you're looking for.\\nThis is one of the things I really like\\nabout generating images in Firefly's text-to-image module.\\nSo over here I'm going to set the aspect ratio\\nof the image I'm asking for to portrait,\\nwhich means a vertical image instead of a square.\\nBecause these are pretty tall buildings,\\nI think they'll look better in a portrait photo.\\n\\nAnd where it says content type,\\nnotice that it's set to auto.\\nThat means that Firefly is going to choose between photo\\nand art as the type of content it's going to return for you.\\nThis time it did choose photo,\\nso I'm happy with that.\\nWhen the content type is set to auto,\\nthen the visual intensity slider can give you\\na more or less realistic-looking photo.\\nDragging to the left will get you a more realistic photo,\\ndragging to the right,\\na more stylized photo.\\n\\nI also would like to have a closer view of the city.\\nSo I'm going to scroll down to the bottom\\nbecause I know that when content type is set to photo,\\nwe have some photo settings down here\\nat the bottom of this panel.\\nAnd here you can set the aperture or the f-stop,\\nthe shutter speed, and the field of view.\\nAll terms you may know if you do much photography.\\nSo this is a feature that really appeals to photographers.\\nWell, I'm going to go to field of view where the lens length\\nis now set to a very wide angle.\\n\\nI'd rather it be closer in,\\nmore like a telephoto lens might be.\\nSo I'll take that slider and I'll go all the way over\\nto the right there.\\nNow I'm going to generate again.\\nAnd this time Firefly not only has my text prompt\\nto take into account,\\nbut also all those inputs that I added.\\nSo let's see what we get.\\nIf I click generate,\\nthere will be four new images.\\nNow, by the way,\\nyou're welcome to use the same prompts\\nthat I use throughout the course,\\nbut keep in mind that the images returned to you\\nwon't be exactly the same as those you see on my screen\\nbecause every time an image is generated in Firefly,\\nnovel images that don't already exist\\nare put together and delivered.\\n\\nSo here I'm getting much closer\\nto the kind of image I have in mind.\\nThere's only one more thing I'd like.\\nI'd like the sky to be a darker blue.\\nNow, sometimes the best way to get\\na specific result like that is to give Firefly another image\\nto look at as a reference,\\nand that's built into the text-to-image module.\\nSo if I scroll up\\nand I go to the Style Match Reference Image Gallery\\nand click there,\\nI can see a number of thumbnails of reference images\\nthat I could use to influence what Firefly returns to me.\\n\\nNow, most of these are art styles,\\nso they're not that relevant to photographs,\\nbut I remember seeing down here a landscape section\\nand there is a little dark image.\\nLet's try that.\\nI'll click it and that loads it as my style reference image.\\nYou can also upload an image from your computer,\\none to which you have rights.\\nSo I'm going to go down here,\\nI'll check that that is my style reference image,\\nand I'll click Generate one more time.\\nSo I think you can see that prompting\\nfor an image is really an iterative process.\\n\\nYou often have to modify your text prompt\\nand fine-tune the other inputs that you're giving Firefly.\\nGreat. This is exactly what I had in mind.\\nOf these four,\\nI think this one will do the trick.\\nAnd so the next step is to take this image\\nfrom Firefly into Photoshop,\\nand that's what I'll show you how to do in the next movie.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5907154\",\"duration\":142,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Take images from Firefly to

[Instructor] In this chapter, we'll use Photoshop\\nto make another composite of Firefly-generated images.\\nBut this time we'll take it up a notch\\nby digging deeper into Photoshop's compositing tools\\nand Firefly's text to image options.\\nThroughout the chapter, we'll work on this fun composite\\nthat plays with scale and illusion.\\nWe'll start by generating\\na photorealistic background in Firefly.\\nHere on the Firefly homepage,\\nfind the text prompt box\\nand enter a description of the background image\\nthat you want Firefly to generate.\\n\\nI want the background image to be a closeup photo\\nof a tower of rocks in a stream,\\nthe kind sometimes made by environmental artists.\\nSo, I'm going to type closeup\\nof a tower of rocks in a stream,\\nenvironmental art,\\nand I want to add light background to this prompt\\nto try to steer away\\nfrom generating a tower of rocks in a dark environment\\nwhere it may be difficult to see the figures\\nthat we're going to be adding to the background\\nlater in this chapter when we make a composite.\\n\\nSo, my prompt is close up of a tower of rocks in a stream,\\nenvironmental art, light background.\\nI'm going to click Generate,\\nand that opens the Text to image module\\nwith the initial four variations\\nthat Firefly is generating for us.\\nThose aren't bad,\\nbut they're not exactly what I had in mind.\\nI'd like something with a little more punch.\\nSo, I'm going to go over to the panel on the right\\nand choose some other options there\\nthat will help Firefly generate what I have in mind.\\n\\nIn the Aspect ratio field,\\nI'm going to switch from the default Square\\nto Landscape aspect ratio,\\nwhich will give me a horizontal image.\\nAnd then in the Content type field,\\nI just want to make sure that it's set to Photo.\\nAnd then, I'll go down to the Visual intensity slider.\\nThis is one of my favorite controls\\nin the Text to image module.\\nIt can really change the look of images\\nthat Firefly generates.\\nWhen content type is set to Photo,\\ndragging the Visual intensity slider to the left\\nresults in a photorealistic looking,\\nbut sometimes drab looking image.\\n\\nDragging it to the right\\ncan create more intense stylized looking photos.\\nI don't want this photo to look too plain,\\nso I'm going to drag\\nthe Visual intensity slider to the right\\nto try to give the resulting variations extra punch.\\nAnd then, I'll click the Generate button\\nin the text prompt bar.\\nHere are the variations that Firefly has generated\\nin response to the text prompt and those other inputs.\\nI'll click on the first image here to see it larger,\\nand then I'll just click these arrows\\nto cycle through the other images.\\n\\nHere's one I really like.\\nI like this variation\\nbecause it includes some things\\nother than just the rock tower,\\nlike the grass and the foreground rocks.\\nI think that those will give scale to the other items,\\nsome miniature people climbing the tower\\nthat I'm planning to add to my final composite.\\nNow, remember, you're not going to get\\nthis same image that I did\\nbecause every image\\ngenerated by Firefly generative AI is new.\\nIf you don't love what you get,\\nyou can always click the Refresh button\\ndown in the text prompt bar and try again\\nuntil you get a background image that you like.\\n\\nWhen you do get a result that you like,\\nit's important to download it and favorite it\\nbecause Firefly is unlikely\\nto generate the same image again.\\nSo, on this image, the one that I like,\\nI'll hover over it\\nand I'll click this More options button\\nand I'll choose Download.\\nI'll click through this information\\nabout content credentials,\\nbut this is a really important aspect\\nof generating images with AI that's worth reading about.\\nI'll click Continue,\\nand then I'll hover over the same image\\nand I'll click the Save to Favorites icon,\\nwhich will allow me to

Earlier in this chapter in Firefly's text to image module,\\nwe generated two images,\\nthis background image of a tower of rocks\\nand this image of some miniature climbers.\\nAnd we downloaded both

text prompt that you use to generate the image,\\nup to a maximum number of characters\\nthat your system allows.\\n\\nNow, in this movie,\\ninto a single file in Adobe Photoshop\\nto begin compositing them.\\nThe first step is to open the background image,\\nwhich is this one,\\nthe tower of rocks in a stream.\\nThere are multiple ways to open files in Photoshop,\\nso if you're following along,\\nyou're welcome to use your favorite method.\\nI'm going to do it from inside Photoshop.\\nHere on Photoshop's home screen,\\nyou can either click this open button\\nand navigate to the file on your system,\\nor you can go up to the file menu,\\nchoose open, and do the same thing.\\n\\nNext, we'll open the image of the miniature climbers\\ninto this same Photoshop document.\\nThere are multiple ways to do that too.\\nFor this lesson,\\nlet's use the drag and drop method.\\nSo arrange your Mac finder or your Windows Explorer window\\nso that you can see both it\\nand the Photoshop document open in Photoshop behind it.\\nThen go to the file that has the miniature mountain climbers\\nand drag it on top of the Photoshop document.\\nAnd then just press enter or return on your keyboard.\\n\\nNow, in your layers panel,\\nyou should see two layers,\\nthe background image of the tower of rocks\\non the bottom layer,\\nand the miniature climbers on the top layer.\\nAnd because they're on separate layers,\\nyou'll be able to edit each image independently\\nwithout harming the other.\\nThat's sometimes called non-destructive editing\\nin Photoshop.\\nThere are a couple of reasons\\nthat I recommended using that drag and drop method\\nof bringing in the miniature climber image,\\nand that's because the resulting layer\\nbears the name of the file\\nthat you dragged into the composite.\\n\\nAnd in this case,\\nthat is the name of the Firefly text prompt.\\nSo it's a nice place to be able to retain that.\\nAnd secondly, this method\\nautomatically creates what's called a smart object,\\nas indicated by this tiny icon\\non the miniature climber layer.\\nA smart object acts like a container\\nthat protects the image\\nso that you can change its size\\nor otherwise transform it multiple times in Photoshop\\nwithout harming its image quality.\\nGreat, so now that we have both images\\ninside of a single document in Photoshop,\\nwe're going to combine them.\\n\\nAnd to do that,\\nwe're going to use a selection,\\nand then make a mask from that selection.\\nAnd that's a key traditional Photoshop compositing

[Instructor] In this video,\\nyou'll combine two Firefly-generated images\\nusing a selection and mask inside Photoshop.\\nJust to remind you,\\nwe brought two images generated\\nin Firefly's text-to-image module\\ninside this single document in Photoshop\\nso we can create a composite.\\nAnd as you know, on the top layer,\\nwe have this image of the miniature climbers.\\nAnd on the bottom layer,\\nwe have this Firefly-generated image of a tower of rocks.\\n\\nOur goal in this movie is to remove the gray area\\naround these climbers so they look like they're sitting\\nright on the image with the tower of rocks\\non the layer below them.\\nSo that at the end of the movie,\\nwe'll have something that looks like this.\\nOne quick way to remove the gray surroundings\\nmight be the one-click Remove background command.\\nTo try it, make sure that the layer\\nwith the miniature climbers is highlighted\\nin the Layers panel.\\nAnd then, look for a floating Task Bar\\nthat looks like this one.\\n\\nWe call this the Contextual Task Bar\\nbecause it shows different commands\\ndepending on what you're doing at the moment.\\nAt this point in the process,\\nit should include the Remove background command.\\nIf it doesn't or if you just can't find\\nthe Contextual Task Bar on your screen,\\nyou can skip this step.\\nNow, I'll click Remove background on the Task Bar,\\nand there's the result.\\nSo at first it might look good,\\nbut if you look closely,\\nthere are only two climbers here, not the three\\non the original image.\\nAnd if you look over here,\\nyou can see that there's still some gray around the woman.\\n\\nSo I'm going to undo, command + z on a Mac\\nor control + z on Windows,\\nand show you another way of removing a background,\\nwhich may give you a better result.\\nThis is a two-step method.\\nFirst you make a selection,\\nand then you create a layer mask from that selection.\\nYou can use any selection tool to make your selection.\\nI like to use Select subject\\nbecause that selection method is automatic and quick.\\nRather than use Select subject here\\nin the Contextual Task Bar,\\nI'm going to try to run it from the cloud,\\nbecause that often gives better results.\\n\\nSo in the Tool Bar,\\nI've got the Object Selection tool selected here.\\nAnd then, I'll go up to the Options bar.\\nAnd where it says Select Subject, I won't click yet.\\nInstead, I'll click this down-facing arrow\\nand choose Cloud.\\nAnd then click Select Subject.\\nAnd it cleanly selects all three climbers.\\nThe next step is to add a mask\\nthat will hide everything on this layer\\nexcept what we selected.\\nIn other words, all the gray background will be hidden,\\nand we'll see only the climbers.\\n\\nSo with the layer that contains the climbers still selected\\nin the Layers panel,\\nI'll go back to the Contextual Task Bar.\\nAnd look, the commands on that Task Bar have changed.\\nThat's because the Contextual Task Bar\\ndisplays different commands when a selection is active\\nthan when it isn't.\\nBy the way, if you don't see your Contextual Task Bar,\\ngo up to the Window menu at the top of the screen\\nand choose it from there.\\nNow, all that's left to do is click this mask icon\\non the Contextual Task Bar.\\n\\nAnd that creates a mask based on our selection.\\nIt keeps what was selected, the climbers,\\nand hides everything else.\\nIf you look at the Layers panel,\\nyou'll see that there's now a black layer mask icon\\non the climber layer,\\nand it has some little white figures on it.\\nI'll make that big so you can see it.\\nSo everything that we selected is white on the layer mask,\\nand therefore, is showing.\\nAnd everything we didn't select is black on the layer mask,\\nand therefore, is hidden from view.\\nAnd what's great about doing this,\\nas opposed to just selecting and deleting\\nthat gray background, is that it's still there.\\n\\nWe can bring it back at any time\\nby just making some changes on our mask.\\nSo now that we have only the climbers showing on this layer,\\nthe next step is to transform them,\\nmoving them, changing their size,\\nmaybe flipping them,\\nso that they look like they're really climbing\\nthat tower of rocks.\\nAnd we'll do that in the next movie.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5905137\",\"duration\":330,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Transform generated

rocks,\\nand even flip one of the climbers,\\nso he's facing the other way,\\nall using traditional transform features in Photoshop\\nto manipulate our Firefly generated images.\\n\\nFirst, let's scale the climbers down\\nto make them look even smaller.\\nIn the layers panel, make sure that the top layer,\\nthe one that contains the miniature climbers is selected.\\nThen go up to the menu bar and choose Edit, Free Transform.\\nOr you can use the keyboard shortcut, Command + T on Mac\\nor Control + T on Windows.\\nThat adds this blue bounding box around the climber's image\\nwith small square handles at the corners\\nand edges of the box.\\n\\nIf you don't see the corner handles,\\npress Command + 0 on Mac or Control + 0 on windows.\\nThat shortcut should zoom the image out,\\nso you can see those handles.\\nNow drag one of the corner handles inward\\nuntil the climbers are about half their original size.\\nThen click inside the blue box\\nand drag the climbers up onto the rocks.\\nI'm putting my two bottom most climbers\\nwhere I think they look okay.\\nI'm ignoring the top most climber for now\\nbecause he needs a little more work.\\n\\nYou don't have to get the

harmed\\nby repeated transformations.\\nWhen you're done moving the climbers where you want them,\\npress Enter or Return on your keyboard.\\nSo that topmost climber doesn't really look like he fits.\\nHe's walking off that rock.\\nLet's flip him horizontally, so he is facing the other way.\\n\\nTo do that, we have to select him\\nand put him on his own separate layer\\nso as not to affect the other climbers.\\nGrab the lasso tool over in the toolbar\\nand make a rough selection around the topmost climber only.\\nI'm not going to include this rope.\\nNow go up to the menu bar\\nand choose Layer, New, Layer Via Copy.\\nThat makes a copy of the climber on a new layer.\\n\\nLayer 1 in the layers panel,\\nand that copy includes some of the gray background\\nfrom the original climber image.\\nYou don't have to do this,\\nbut I'm going to drag the copy of the climber over here,\\njust so you can get a better view of what's happening.\\nNow let's flip that copied climber by going up to Edit,\\nTransform, and all the way at the bottom, Flip Horizontal,\\nand now the copy of the climber is facing to the left\\ninstead of to the right, like the original climber.\\n\\nLet's remove that extra gray background\\naround the copy of the climber\\nusing the same select and mask workflow\\nthat we used in the last movie.\\nTo review, we'll click the object selection tool\\nand then up in the options bar, click the arrow to the right\\nof Select Subject and choose Cloud,\\nand then click Select Subject,\\nthat adds a selection around the copied climber.\\nNow go to your contextual

[Instructor] Lighting and color\\nare critical to getting a composite to look natural,\\nparticularly when you're starting with images\\nfrom different sources, as in this composite,\\nwhere we have images generated separately in Firefly.\\nSo we need to harmonize their lighting\\nand their color here in Photoshop.\\nLet's talk about lighting first in this movie.\\nGlancing at our composite, it's fair to say\\nthat the miniature people\\ndon't really stand out against the background.\\nBut to fix that, we need to know why.\\nSo the first step is to analyze the lighting.\\n\\nLet me zoom in so you can get a better look at the climbers.\\nAnd if you look closely,\\nyou can see that there's not much difference\\nbetween the brightness of the figures\\nand the brightness of the rocks in the background.\\nIf anything, the figures are darker than the background.\\nWell, that suggests the solution is to brighten the figures.\\nTo do that, we're going to apply\\nwhat's called an adjustment layer.\\nAn adjustment layer is a separate,\\nnon-destructive layer that affects the layers below it,\\nbut doesn't permanently change them.\\nTo apply an adjustment layer here,\\nwe've got the top-most layer selected\\nin the Layers panel.\\n\\nBy the way, that top layer contains the climber\\nat the top of the stack of rocks,\\nand the middle layer can contains\\nthese other two climbers.\\nAnd the bottom layer contains the photographic background.\\nSo with the top layer selected,\\nwe'll go to the bottom of the Layers panel,\\nand we'll click this black and white circle icon,\\nand we'll choose Levels as the type of adjustment layer.\\nThat adds this levels adjustment layer above the layer\\nthat was selected,\\nand it opens controls for this layer here in another panel,\\nthe Properties panel.\\n\\nWe're not going to go through\\nall the controls in the Properties panel.\\nInstead, I just want to focus on a few of them\\nso you can get a sense\\nof how to adjust lighting in a composite like this\\nthat's made up of multiple Firefly-generated images.\\nIn the middle of the Properties panel,\\nyou'll see this chart.\\nThis is a graph or a chart\\nof all of the tonal values in this composite,\\nand it's called a histogram.\\nThere are three sliders directly under the histogram.\\nThe one on the right mostly affects\\nthe brightest tones in the image.\\n\\nMaybe like the hat on this climber.\\nIf I were to pull the white slider over to the left,\\nthat would push all the tones\\nto the right of it in the histogram,\\nand there are only a few, to bright white with no detail.\\nThe middle slider affects mostly the midtones.\\nSo if I were to drag this over to the left,\\nthat makes the midtones in the entire composite brighter.\\nAnd when you adjust the midtones,\\nit changes the look of the whole image.\\nNow notice that everything got brighter\\nwith those changes, not only the climbers,\\nbut also the photo background behind them.\\n\\nAnd we only wanted to impact the climbers\\nto make them brighter so they stand out against the rocks.\\nHow can we do that?\\nWell, we can restrict that levels adjustment layer\\nso it affects only layers\\nthat have climbers, not the background.\\nTo do that, we're going to have to put the multiple layers\\nthat have climbers on them into a group.\\nSo I will select Layer 1 that has the third climber.\\nI'll hold Cmd on the Mac, Ctrl on Windows,\\nand select this layer.\\nAlso, it's the layer with the other two climbers on it.\\n\\nThen I'll go to the bottom of the Layers panel\\nand I'll click this folder icon,\\nand that puts them both into this group.\\nYou can see them there if I open and close the group,\\nThen, I'll select the Levels layer\\nand I'll clip it to that group.\\nOne way to clip it is to go up to the bottom\\nof the Properties panel and click on this clipping icon.\\nNow, you can tell by this bent arrow\\non the levels adjustment layer\\nthat it's clipped to the group below it.\\nAnd in the image, you can see\\nthat only the climbers are now brighter than they were.\\n\\nI think you can see that more clearly.\\nIf I turn the levels adjustment layer off.\\nNow the climbers look dark as they originally were,\\nand turn it back on, and now they're brighter,\\noff and then on, and only the climbers are being affected.\\nSo that's exactly the result we wanted.\\nWe brightened the figures, but not the background,\\nand the figures stand out a little better.\\nBut, I think those figures don't pop as much\\nas I expected them

[Lecturer] Adjusting color is another powerful way\\nto enhance a composite.\\nColor can be used to unify Firefly generated images\\nin a composite as we did in chapter one.\\nIt can also be used to change the appearance\\nof Firefly generated elements\\nlike the climbers in this composite.\\nTo do that in this movie, we're going\\nto apply another adjustment layer,\\na hue saturation adjustment layer.\\nIn the preceding movie, we made the climbers brighter\\nwith this levels adjustment layer.\\n\\nI'll turn it off and then on\\nto remind you of the effect of the levels adjustment layer.\\nWe did that by restricting the effect of\\nthat adjustment layer to only the layers\\nthat contain the climbers and not the background.\\nNow with that levels adjustment layer selected,\\nlet's make another adjustment layer,\\na hue saturation adjustment layer.\\nAnd we'll also restrict that adjustment layer\\nto our group of climber layers.\\nI'll go to the bottom of the layers panel\\nand click the black and white icon,\\nand this time I'll choose hue saturation.\\n\\nThat creates a hue saturation adjustment layer\\nat the top of the layer stack.\\nAnd in the Properties panel, we now see the controls\\nfor that hue saturation adjustment layer.\\nI'll zoom in a bit on the climbers so you can see the effect\\nof the changes I'm going to make in the properties panel.\\nI'll drag the saturation slider over to the right, and\\nas I do that, the entire image is getting more saturated.\\nSaturation refers to the intensity of colors in an image.\\nSo here we've increased the intensity\\nof all the colors everywhere in the composite.\\n\\nI like the blue color in the shirts of a couple\\nof these climbers, and I'd like\\nthat color to pop out more too.\\nSo, I'm going to try to saturate just the blue color.\\nNow, I could go to this master menu,\\nand from there choose what I'm guessing that color is.\\nMaybe it's cyan, maybe it's blue, maybe it's green,\\nor maybe it's some combination of all of those.\\nTo avoid having to guess,\\nthere's another tool that can help me here,\\nthis targeted adjustment tool.\\n\\nSo I'm going to select that\\nand then I'll move over the color of this climber's shirt.\\nI'll click and I'll drag to the right.\\nI'm going to do it a lot so you can see that\\nwhat's happening is that the color on which I clicked\\nis now getting more saturated everywhere\\nthat color appears in the image.\\nWell, of course, that's too much\\nso I'm going to push that back a little bit\\nmaybe to about there.\\nNow, if you remember, the reason we wanted\\nto increase color saturation is to make all the climbers\\nstand out more against the photo in the background.\\n\\nSo, the last thing we're going to do is clip\\nour hue saturation adjustment layer to this group,\\nwhich contains the climber layers.\\nTo do that, just as we did with the levels adjustment layer\\nin the last movie, I'll go up to the Properties panel\\nand click the clipping icon there.\\nNow you can see the bent arrow that indicates\\nthis layer is clipped just like the bent arrow\\non the levels layer below it.\\nAnd to show you the result, I'm going to turn\\nmy hue saturation layer off and on again,\\nand notice that it's only affecting the colors\\non the climbers, not the colors in the background.\\n\\nSo what should you take from this movie?\\nWell, the thing to remember\\nis that adjusting color using traditional Photoshop tools\\nlike adjustment layers is another significant way\\nto enhance a composite that's made up\\nof Firefly generated images.\\nIt's just one more example of the power\\nof using Firefly and Photoshop together.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

[Instructor] So far in this course,\\nwhen we've used generative AI,\\nwe've done that in Adobe Firefly, the web application.\\nBut the web application isn't the only Adobe application\\nthat includes Firefly technology.\\nAdobe has been integrating it\\ninto its flagship applications too,\\nincluding Adobe Photoshop.\\nSo in this chapter,\\nwe'll focus on some powerful ways\\nto use the generative AI features in Photoshop,\\nlike Generative Fill and Generative Expand,\\nas an integral part of our Firefly\\nto Photoshop compositing workflow.\\n\\nIn this movie, we'll use Generative Fill in Photoshop\\nto remove an object from this image.\\nGenerative Fill lets you remove, add,\\nand replace objects non-destructively\\nby placing your edits on separate layers\\ncalled Generative Fill layers.\\nBefore we get started removing an object\\nwith Generative Fill, take a look at the Layers panel.\\nI can see that I have an adjustment layer selected there\\nfrom the preceding chapter.\\nAnd Generative Fill doesn't work on an adjustment layer.\\nSo the first thing we're going to do\\nis create a regular layer.\\n\\nI'll do that by going to the bottom of the Layers panel\\nand clicking the plus icon.\\nNow, let's make sure that our Contextual Task Bar is showing\\nbecause this bar is an important place\\nfor accessing Generative Fill in Photoshop.\\nIf your Task Bar isn't showing,\\ngo to the Window menu at the top of the screen\\nand choose Contextual Task Bar.\\nAnd you can pin the Task Bar wherever you want\\nso it doesn't keep changing locations.\\nTo do that, click these three dots\\nand choose Pin bar position.\\n\\nNow we're ready to start using Generative Fill.\\nI'm going to zoom in to give you a closer look\\nat these climbers.\\nGenerative Fill always starts with a selection.\\nAnd when you're trying to remove something,\\nyou can make a very rough selection\\naround the items that you want to remove.\\nTo do that, I'll get the Lasso Tool in the Tool Bar,\\nand I'll make a freeform really quick selection\\naround this rope and that brown area that I want to remove.\\nAnd it's important to include a little\\nof the surrounding area inside your selection.\\n\\nThen, go down to the Contextual Task Bar.\\nYou'll see that it's changed to include Generative Fill,\\nwhich it does when a selection is active.\\nThen, click where it says Generative Fill.\\nDon't type anything into the text prompt field that appears.\\nWe're going to do a promptless generation this time.\\nAnd then go over and click Generate\\non the right side of the Task Bar.\\nThis box up here contains some tips\\nthat you can read while Generative Fill is doing its work.\\n\\nAnd in just a moment,\\nthe rope and the brown area have disappeared from view.\\nIf you look over in the Properties panel,\\nyou can see that Generative Fill has created\\nthree variations of content that it's using\\nto hide the rope and the brown object.\\nAnd you can click between those variations,\\nkeeping your eye on the image,\\nand choose the result that you like best.\\nI think I'll go with the first variation.\\nDown in the Layers panel,\\nyou can see that there's now a new layer.\\nYou know this is a Generative Fill layer\\nbecause of the icon on its thumbnail.\\n\\nA Generative Fill layer acts like any other layer,\\nin that you can turn it on and off.\\nAnd you can see the rope come back into view\\nwhen I turn it off.\\nI'll turn it back on.\\nYou can move it around in the Layers Stack.\\nYou could even delete it completely.\\nAnd you can work with its content separately\\nfrom the content of all the other layers,\\nwhich is why it's called non-destructive editing.\\nIf you pan around this image,\\nwhich you can do by holding the space bar and dragging,\\nyou'll probably see some other items\\nthat you'd like to remove.\\n\\nTry removing them the same way we just did\\nby making a selection and then running Generative Fill.\\nBut remember that one of the advantages\\nof using Generative Fill here in Photoshop,\\nas opposed to in Firefly,\\nis that here, you have access\\nto lots of other retouching tools.\\nSo if Generative Fill doesn't give you a perfect result,\\nyou may want to use the powerful Remove Tool\\nor one of the other retouching tools.\\nRemoving objects from an image isn't the only thing\\nPhotoshop's Generative Fill will do for you.\\n\\nYou can also use it to add brand new objects to an image.\\nAnd that's what we'll do in the next movie.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5902153\",\"duration\":203,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Add objects with Generative Fill in

[Instructor] One of the most amazing things\\nthat you can do with Generative Fill in Photoshop\\nis have it create new objects for you\\nthat integrate with the images in your composite.\\nGenerative Fill does this based on a text prompt\\nthat you enter along with a selection that you make.\\nSo let's start by zooming in on this rock\\nso we can get a better view.\\nAnd what I'd like to do is have Generative Fill\\ncreate a little pile of climbing gear here on the rock.\\nFirst I have to make a selection.\\n\\nI'm going to use the Lasso tool for that.\\nYou can use any selection tool.\\nI'd like using the Lasso tool because it's freeform,\\nand so it lets me control\\nthe size and shape of my selection.\\nAnd those are important variables\\nbecause they influence what Generative Fill creates for you.\\nThen I'll go down to the Contextual task bar,\\nand I'll click where it says Generative Fill.\\nThis time, we're going to add a prompt here, a text prompt,\\nthat describes what we want.\\nI'll just type \\\"a pile of climbing gear,\\\"\\nand then click Generate.\\n\\nPhotoshop gives us some tips about Generative Fill to read\\nwhile we're waiting for it to generate objects for us.\\nWell, that first object isn't going to work,\\nbut if you look over in the Properties panel,\\nthere's more than one variation to choose from.\\nSo I'll try the second variation,\\nand that looks pretty good.\\nAnd the third.\\nI like this one.\\nAnd what I'd like you to see about it\\nis that Generative Fill does its best to match the lighting\\nand the perspective and the color of the scene around it.\\n\\nAnd that's an advantage over generating content\\nback in Firefly's Text-to-Image module,\\nand then bringing it into Photoshop,\\nwhere you have to integrate it yourself\\nin terms of color, tone, and perspective.\\nAnd the advantage of using Generative Fill in Photoshop\\nover Generative Fill in Firefly is that in Photoshop,\\nGenerative Fill is non-destructive, as we've said.\\nHere you can see that the results came in\\non a brand new layer that's named automatically\\nwith our text prompt.\\n\\nNow, what do you do\\nif you don't get any results that you want?\\nWell, in that case, you can just come back\\nto the Contextual task bar\\nand click Generate again\\nas many times as you'd like.\\nIf you're still not getting results you want,\\nconsider changing your text prompt.\\nMaybe you're not being specific enough\\nabout what you want, for example.\\nTo change the text prompt,\\nyou can come up to the Properties panel\\nand type in something different up here,\\nor just add to your initial prompt,\\nand then generate again.\\nAnd if you're still not getting anything you want,\\nyou can delete the Generative Fill layer\\nand that gets rid of all your variations.\\n\\nAnd you could make a new selection,\\nenter a new text prompt, and generate again.\\nAnd one more thing,\\nif you do have a lot of variations\\nhere in the Properties panel,\\nand there's some that you're sure you're not going to use,\\na good idea is to throw those away\\nby selecting their thumbnail, one at a time,\\nand then clicking the little trash can.\\nAnd that will help you to manage the file size\\nof the resulting composite.\\nSo that's a look at using Generative Fill in Photoshop\\nto add new objects to a

horizontal\\ninto a vertical image without losing\\nany of the original content.\\n\\nAnd with Photoshop automatically filling in the expanded\\nedges at the top and bottom.\\nTo see what I mean,

options bar for the crop tool,\\nchange the fill option from its default\\nto generative expand.\\nNow, I could freely drag\\nany of the edges, expanding them like this,\\nand if I were to complete the crop, which I'm not going\\nto do right now, Photoshop would automatically fill in these\\nexpanded areas with brand new content\\nthat it generates from scratch.\\n\\nThat's pretty amazing.\\nBut
