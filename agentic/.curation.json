Every swipe, every search, every question you ask AI,\\nit's collecting data,\\nbut have you ever thought about who's actually in charge\\nof keeping that data safe?\\nDon't worry, I have.\\nIn this video, let's unpack the foundations\\nof data governance and security,\\nand take a look how they work hand in hand\\nto maintain trustworthy AI.\\nLet's start with data governance,\\nthe foundation of data protection.\\nImagine data governance as the rule book\\nfor managing data within an organization.\\n\\nIt's all about establishing policies and controls\\nto ensure data quality, security, and compliance\\nwith both internal standards and legal regulations.\\nGovernance covers three essential areas.\\nFirst, governance defines who owns the data\\nand who has the right to access it.\\nThis is important because not everyone in an organization\\nshould have access to all types of data,\\nespecially when it contains sensitive information.\\nGovernance also includes policies\\non data retention and usage.\\n\\nThese policies define how long data should be kept,\\nwhen it should be deleted, and how it should be used.\\nThis helps organizations avoid unnecessary data storage,\\nwhich can reduce risks and save resources.\\nLastly, data governance ensures transparency\\nand accountability in how AI systems make decisions.\\nWhen AI is used in finance, healthcare, or hiring,\\npeople's lives and livelihoods are at stake.\\nUnderstanding how decisions are made\\ncan be a matter of life and death.\\n\\nBeyond these basics,\\ngovernance also keeps organizations in line\\nwith regulatory standards, like GDPR in Europe\\nor the various US state-specific laws\\nthat protect user privacy in California, Colorado,\\nVirginia, and more.\\nAnd all of that builds trust\\nwith stakeholders and end users.\\nWhile governance focuses on creating rules and standards,\\nsecurity is about actively protecting data\\nfrom the moment it's collected through storage\\nand processing to its eventual deletion.\\n\\nThere are several ways to secure the data\\nwithin your AI system,\\nand we'll go deeper into each of these in future videos.\\nRestricting data access prevents those without permissions\\nfrom accessing the information.\\nRemember, governance sets the rules\\nfor data ownership and access.\\nNow it's security's job to implement them.\\nMaintaining data integrity is also important\\nbecause AI models depend on accurate data\\nto make accurate predictions.\\nEnsuring the integrity of the data and models\\nprevents biased or misleading results.\\n\\nNow, I know what you're thinking.\\nHow is this different\\nthan traditional data governance and security?\\nWell, I'm glad you asked.\\nAI introduces new and unique security threats\\nand attack vectors that require advanced risk\\nand threat monitoring.\\nFor example, think about a traditional adversarial attack.\\nThe attacker generally has two goals:\\nto steal data or to interrupt your business.\\nEither way, you'll likely detect and respond quickly.\\nHowever, with AI, an attacker can manipulate input data\\nto deceive an AI model\\nand influence the output to their advantage,\\noften without anyone knowing.\\n\\nImagine a security camera\\nthat uses AI for facial recognition.\\nThe hacker can trick the camera into misidentifying a face\\nand grant unauthorized access.\\nScary, huh?\\nIn short, governance and security work together\\nto keep data safe, accurate, and trustworthy.\\nGovernance sets the rules and security implements them.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:6043233\",\"duration\":221,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Key risks for data used in AI

system\\nbecause the models are only as reliable\\nas the data they're trained on.\\nIf that data is flawed, biased, or outdated,\\nwe can't expect the model's decisions\\nto be accurate or fair.\\n\\nImagine an AI system trained on data\\nthat has gaps like a jigsaw puzzle with missing pieces,\\nexcept this isn't just a minor flaw.\\nWith AI systems, it could lead\\nto harmful outcomes like inequitable hiring practices\\nor inaccurate healthcare recommendations.\\nNow, here's where things get complicated.\\nUnlike traditional software,\\nAI systems don't always stay static.\\nMany of them learn over time\\nand continuously take in new data to evolve their decisions.\\nWhen the data is dynamic, there are more chances\\nfor poor data to sneak in,\\nespecially, if there aren't sufficient\\ngovernance controls in place.\\n\\nAnd lastly, with data privacy regulations\\nconstantly evolving,\\nyou need to make sure your governance policies\\nstay up to date and adapt your practices accordingly.\\nBy setting strict governance rules\\naround what data gets used\\nthroughout the AI system's lifecycle,\\nyou reduce the chance of using poor data\\nthat can compromise the model.\\nGood governance keeps AI systems accurate and fair.\\nNow, let's talk about security risks.\\nBecause AI systems process vast amounts of valuable data,\\nthey're prime targets for cyber attacks.\\n\\nThis is why addressing threats to confidentiality,\\nintegrity, and availability of data,\\nmonitoring third-party dependencies\\nand maintaining transparency\\nand explainability are so important.\\nLet's look at each of these a little deeper.\\nIt's no surprise that poor access controls\\nor inadequate encryption\\ncan threaten the confidentiality of sensitive data.\\nHowever, in AI, a data breach doesn't just\\nrisk the exfiltration of personal data.\\nIt can also lead to the exposure of the AI model itself.\\n\\nUnlike traditional hacks,\\nthese adversarial attacks can manipulate the data inputs\\nand alter the integrity of the AI model's output,\\nforcing the system into making wrong decisions.\\nImagine if your AI model fell into the wrong hands,\\nit would be a nightmare for both privacy\\nand business integrity.\\nAnother big risk comes from third-party dependencies.\\nMany organizations use external vendors for AI tools,\\ncloud storage, and data processing.\\nThere are also various regulations\\nor statutory frameworks companies need to adhere to,\\nand some might also have specific customer\\nor industry-specific standards applicable to AI.\\n\\nAll of these relationships introduce new risk.\\nIf a vendor has weak data handling policies\\nor outdated security protocols,\\nyour data could be at risk\\neven if you are following the best practices on your end.\\nFinally, let's talk about transparency\\nand explainability, or lack of it.\\nAI models, especially complex ones,\\nare often seen as black boxes where it's hard\\nto understand why certain decisions are made.\\nWhen you can't explain an AI system's decisions.\\nIt's much harder to detect when things go wrong,\\nlike spotting biases or security vulnerabilities.\\n\\nTransparency isn't just a buzzword.\\nIt's crucial for building trust\\nand ensuring AI systems act responsibly.\\nUnderstanding these risks is the first step\\nin protecting AI systems\\nfrom potentially dangerous outcomes.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2738183\",\"duration\":168,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"The

toxic drink, a disruptive gadget,\\nor a stinky tuna sandwich?\\nWhat gets into the club\\nmatters just as much as who gets into it.\\nAI data pipelines move raw data through a series of stages\\nuntil it's refined into actionable insights.\\nThink of it like guests moving through our nightclub.\\n\\nEach stage requires attention\\nto make sure nothing harmful enters or lingers.\\nFor an AI system,\\ndata might start as customer transaction logs,\\nbe transformed into structured data sets,\\nand eventually live in a secure repository\\nfor training AI models.\\nAnd just like a club's reputation\\ncan be destroyed by one bad incident,\\nyour pipeline needs to remain secure at every stage\\nto protect your system's integrity.\\nThe first step in securing your pipeline\\nis protecting data as it enters the system.\\n\\nData ingestion often involves external sources\\nlike IoT devices, customer platforms, or third-party APIs.\\nOne of the most effective techniques\\nfor detecting and rejecting malicious data\\nis regular expression validation or regex.\\nThis method determines\\nif data inputs conform to expected formats,\\nand prevents the injection of harmful or unexpected data.\\nLet's look at an example.\\nImagine your AI system\\nrelies on user-submitted email addresses\\nfor training its model.\\n\\nThe expected input would be something like name@domain.com.\\nYour regex defines this pattern in code\\nand tells the AI pipeline what data to accept or reject.\\nAs you can see,\\nvalid inputs must match the pattern of an email address.\\nFirst, the expression must have a string of letters,\\nnumbers, and/or symbols.\\nNext, it must have an @ symbol.\\nThen it should have another text string, a period,\\nand a final text string.\\n\\nIf it doesn't match,\\nit's an invalid email,\\nand the AI system should reject the data.\\nYou'll also want to define test cases.\\nRemember, the AI system is only as good\\nas the data it's trained on,\\nso provide as many examples of valid\\nand invalid inputs as you can.\\nIf malicious actors attempt to inject\\nanything other than an email address in that field,\\nsuch as harmful scripts\\nor SQL commands, a mismatch error will occur.\\nOnce data is inside the pipeline,\\nit moves to the transformation stage\\nwhere it's cleaned, structured, and prepared for use.\\n\\nThis is an important step in AI governance,\\nbut it's also the riskiest.\\nBecause data is being intentionally changed,\\nit can be difficult to recognize anomalies\\nor unusual behavior.\\nLet's take a look\\nat one of the most common forms\\nof maintaining data integrity during transformation:\\nhashing.\\nHere's a very simplified Python script for hashing data.\\nYou'll begin by generating a pre-transformation hash.\\nAfter the data is transformed,\\nthe system can recompute the hash\\nand detect any unauthorized modifications.\\n\\nHashing can also be helpful\\nin the final stage of the pipeline data storage.\\nBy storing a secure hash for each data record,\\nthe system can periodically verify\\nthat the data remains unchanged.\\nIf an attacker alters a record,\\nthe hash value will no longer match the stored hash,\\nflagging the modification.\\nBy protecting data integrity at every stage of the pipeline,\\nyour AI systems will deliver insights\\nyou and your stakeholders can trust.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2737225\",\"duration\":125,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Securing AI models and

So far, we focused on protecting AI models\\nfrom external threats,\\npreventing attackers from manipulating your system\\nand undermining its quality.\\nBut even without external interference,\\nAI

data no longer resembles the data\\nthe model was trained on.\\nFor example, a fraud detection AI system might begin\\nflagging fewer anomalies over time.\\n\\nThe reason?\\nCustomer transaction

recommendation that has no scientific basis.\\nThat's not just inaccurate, it's dangerous.\\nCatching these issues early allows you to retrain\\nand recalibrate the model before it becomes ineffective.\\n\\nBut to catch those issues, you need the right tools.\\nAnd unlike traditional software,\\nAI models need specific techniques\\nto address these unique threats.\\nFor example, drift detection algorithms can identify\\nwhen incoming data no longer aligns with the training data.\\nAnomaly detection systems can flag unusual patterns\\nand outputs, such as hallucinated or erratic responses.\\nAnother technique is integrating feedback loops.\\nThese are seen most commonly in chatbots\\nthat request user feedback on responses\\nto highlight inaccuracies.\\n\\nThis information helps fine tune the model\\nand reduce hallucinations and drift over time.\\nBut regularly updating and monitoring data\\nis just the beginning.\\nThe next step is maintenance.\\nImagine trying to

[Instructor] Foundation models are the cornerstone\\nof modern LLM based systems.\\nThese are large scale, pre-trained models built\\non extensive data sets, including diverse information\\nfrom across the internet.\\nThink of foundation models as the starting point\\nfor AI systems.\\nThey're equipped with a broad understanding\\nof languages, concepts, and context.\\nIn LLMOps, foundation models serve as the backbone\\nfor specialized applications.\\n\\nInstead of building a language model from scratch,\\norganizations can leverage these models\\nand adapt them to specific use cases\\nthrough fine tuning or prompt engineering.\\nFor instance, a healthcare provider\\nmight take a foundation model\\nand fine tune it medical research data\\nto develop an AI power diagnostic assistant.\\nTheir flexibility and scale make foundation models powerful,\\nbut they also introduce challenges such as the risk\\nof inherited biases\\nor security vulnerabilities from their training data sets.\\n\\nThat's why the subsequent steps\\nin the pipeline, embeddings fine tuning\\nand deployment plays such a crucial role\\nin tailoring these models for enterprise level applications\\nwhile mitigating potential risks.\\nLet's start with prompt engineering pipeline.\\nPrompt engineering is about crafting the perfect input\\nto get the desired output from your LLM.\\nInstead of changing the model itself,\\nyou focus on the instructions you give it.\\n\\nThis approach is fast, cost effective,\\nand does not require retraining the model.\\nFirst step of which is prompt tuning.\\nThink of prompt tuning as fine tuning a conversation.\\nYou are just phrasing structure\\nor context to guide the model's responses.\\nExample, a chat bot for a bank might use prompts like,\\n\\\"Explain our loan process in simple terms\\nfor first time borrowers.\\\"\\nNow, why is this important?\\nPrompt tuning allows businesses\\nto quickly adapt their LLMs without investing\\nin expensive retraining.\\n\\nOnce you have designed a prompt, you need\\nto test it rigorously\\nto ensure it performs well across scenarios.\\nSome of the questions you might ask, well,\\ndoes the model respond consistently to similar inputs?\\nCan the model adapt\\nto weighted user inputs without breaking?\\nHow does it handle ambiguous or incomplete prompts?\\nExample, imagine testing a prompt for customer support.\\nIt should work equally well\\nfor a straightforward questions like,\\n\\\"What's your return policy?\\\"\\nOr a more complex one like,\\n\\\"Can I return an item I purchased during a sale?\\\"\\nNext, let's move on to RAG.\\n\\nRAG pipelines make your LLM smarter by combining it\\nwith external data sources.\\nThis approach is perfect for scenarios\\nwhere the model needs real time\\nor domain specific information.\\nYour company data, like FAQs, product catalogs,\\nor reports, is processed through an embedding model.\\nThis transforms the data into vector representations,\\nwhich are like mathematical fingerprints for easy retrieval.\\n\\nThe process data is then stored in a vector database,\\na specialized database for fast, context aware lookups.\\nWhen a user asks a question,\\nthe system retrieves the most relevant information\\nfrom this database.\\nOnce the relevant information is retrieved,\\nit is fed into your LLM\\nto generate precise context aware response.\\nFor example, a customer asks,\\n\\\"What is your warranty policy?\\\"\\nThe system retrieves your company's warranty information\\nand uses the LLM to generate a clear user-friendly response.\\n\\nSo why RAG is important and unique?\\nRAG enhances your LLM's capabilities\\nby plugging in real time domain-specific knowledge.\\nNow, let's switch to fine tuning pipeline.\\nFine tuning is the process\\nof adapting a foundational LLM to specialize\\nin a specific domain or use case.\\nYou start with a general purpose LLM\\nand retrain it using your own dataset.\\n\\nFor instance, a healthcare provider might fine tune a model\\nusing medical documents and case studies to ensure it\\nunderstands industry-specific terms and context.\\nAfter fine tuning, the model must be tested.\\nDoes it perform well on unseen data?\\nDoes it avoid common errors?\\nMetrics like blue score for language specific task\\nor domain specific benchmarks are used\\nto evaluate its performance.\\n\\nFor example, a legal assistant LLM might be tested\\non its ability to summarize contracts\\nwithout emitting critical clauses.\\nOnce the testing is complete,\\nthe model is stored in a model registry.\\nThis acts as a centralized hub for managing model versions,\\nmaking it easy to roll back if something were to go wrong.\\nThe model server is where the deployed models reside\\nand handle real-time requests.\\nIt acts as a bridge between the AI model\\nand the application, ensuring quick\\nand reliable predictions.\\n\\nLLMOps transforms the way large language models\\nare developed and deployed.\\nFrom crafting effective prompts\\nto fine tuning models for a specific task,\\neach pathway plays a vital role in creating powerful,\\nscalable AI solutions.\\nWhether you are building a customer service chat bot,\\nan AI tutor, or a knowledge management system,\\nLLMOps ensure your models are efficient, accurate,\\nand

of this chapter as a highlight reel of the risks\\nreal enough to keep you on your toes,\\nbut light enough to keep you engaged\\nbefore we take a deep plunge.\\n\\nLet's start with data ETL.\\nImagine you are a Fintech company\\nextracting transaction data for fraud detection.\\nWhat happens when an attacker sneaks in fake transactions\\nin this ETL process?\\nSuddenly, your fraud detection system\\nstarts thinking a $100,000 charge for a mystery yacht\\nis perfectly normal.\\nObviously, a normally functioning ETL pipeline\\nwith checks and balances will catch that.\\n\\nNext,

decide to mark stop signs as yield signs,\\nintentionally or not,\\nwe know that this will lead to chaos or accidents.\\nPoison labels can cause models to misbehave\\nin ways you might not even notice before it's too late.\\nNext, let's look at feature engineering.\\nImagine a loan approval model\\nwhere a hidden rule penalizes applicants\\nfrom a specific region.\\nIf features aren't validated properly,\\nsubtle but harmful biases can creep in.\\n\\nFeature stores are meant to make your life easier\\nby storing reusable features.\\nBut what if someone tweaks a feature\\nto always classify malicious behavior as harmless?\\nThink of this as an insider in a financial institution\\naltering fraud detection rules,\\nallowing suspicious activity to go unnoticed.\\nNow that your data is prepped,\\nit's time to experiment with models,\\nbut it's also where things can take a turn for the worse.\\n\\nPoisoned training data is a classic trick.\\nImagine training a spam detector,\\nbut when training data is compromised,\\nyour model starts to think emails offering free Bitcoins\\nare totally legit.\\nTesting is supposed to catch issues,\\nbut if your test data isn't secure or diverse enough,\\nyou're basically rubber stamping your model\\nwithout knowing if it can handle the real world.\\nThink of it as testing a bulletproof vest,\\nbut forgetting to use real bullets.\\n\\nYour model registry\\nis the library of your production ready models.\\nBut when someone sneaks in a tampered model,\\nyou might end up deploying a fraud detection model\\nthat conveniently ignores their transactions.\\nThe deployment pipeline is where your model goes live\\nand starts making predictions.\\nUnfortunately, this is also where attackers get creative.\\nAttackers launch a model inversion attack\\non your model server,\\ncarefully probing your model's outputs\\nto reverse engineer sensitive training data.\\n\\nFor example, a healthcare model trained on patient data\\naccidentally reveals private medical details.\\nInference APIs are like the storefront for your model.\\nAttackers try adversarial inputs,\\nwhich are altered images or data,\\nto trick your model into misclassifying something\\nwhich isn't the case,\\nor they flood the endpoint with traffic\\nin a denial of service attack,\\nmaking your model as useful\\nas a

particularly vulnerable\\nto interception when communication channels\\nare not properly secured, or when misconfigurations\\nleave the system exposed.\\nAttackers often exploit weak encryption\\nor unencrypted data flows\\nto capture sensitive information such as login credentials,\\nfinancial data, or personal health records.\\n\\nFor example, a healthcare organization uses an ETL pipeline\\nto transfer patient data from a database to a feature store\\nfor training a predictive model.\\nThe ETL script uses unencrypted HTTP for transferring data\\nbetween the on-premises database and the cloud.\\nAn attacker performs a person in the middle attack\\non the encrypted data flow,\\nintercepting sensitive health records, including diagnosis\\nand treatment details.\\n\\nThe attacker then uses packet sniffing tools like Wireshark\\nto extract patient data in transit, which could be used\\nto identify theft, or it could also be sold on the dark web.\\nAs a result, the exposure\\nof protected health information called PHI\\nviolates the HIPAA laws\\nand also incurs severe regulatory fines.\\nThe breach damages the organization's reputation\\nand erodes trust in its AI-based healthcare solutions.\\n\\nSo what can an organization do about this?\\nWell, encrypt all data in transit,\\nalways use strong encryption protocols such as TLs 1.3\\nor higher to secure communication channels.\\nEncryption ensures that even\\nif an attacker intercepts the data, it remains unreadable\\nwithout the appropriate decryption keys.\\nFor example, enforcing HTTPS\\nfor all API communications guarantees\\nthat the sensitive data is encrypted during transfer.\\n\\nNext, enable mutual TLS or MTLS.\\nBut wait, what exactly is MTLS?\\nMTLS is a security protocol where both declined\\nand the server authenticate each other\\nduring the handshake process.\\nUnlike standard TLS, which only validates the server,\\nMTLS ensures that both parties\\nare trusted, significantly reducing the risk\\nof spoofing or person in the middle attack.\\nSo why it matters, for instance,\\nin a financial transaction system,\\nMTLS could prevent an attacker from impersonating\\neither the client or the server, ensuring the integrity\\nof sensitive operations like payment processing.\\n\\nNext, audit configuration regularly.\\nContinuously monitor and correct configurations\\nin your cloud or on-premise environments.\\nUse open source configuration scanning tools like ScoutSuite\\nor Cloud Custodian to identify insecure settings.\\nAutomate these scans to detect vulnerabilities in real time\\nand ensure that default configurations,\\nwhich often favor convenience over security, are replaced\\nwith robust settings.\\n\\nAnd lastly, use secure network architectures.\\nImplement network segmentation\\nto isolate sensitive data flows\\nand reduce the attack surface.\\nFor example, route sensitive traffic through private subnets\\nor virtual private clouds\\nto prevent exposure

theft happens when adversaries steal, replicate,\\nor reverse engineer your machine learning model.\\n\\nAttackers typically target the training artifacts,\\nintermediate updates,\\nor the deployed

reconstructs the decision boundaries\\nand weights of the scoring model.\\nThe stolen model is then deployed\\nto bypass security checks on the original system.\\n\\nAnother way this attack could materialize\\nis through unsecured model artifacts.\\nNow, models are stored in artifacts or files\\nlike .pkl or .h5,\\nand then are saved in cloud buckets, on premise servers,\\nor on CICD pipelines.\\nWhen these storage locations lack proper access controls,\\nattackers can directly access the model files.\\nTraining logs and configuration files\\nmay also expose model details,\\nincluding hyper parameters and architecture.\\n\\nInsider threats such as employees, contractors,\\nor partners with legitimate access to the model\\nor its development environment\\ncould also steal the artifacts intentionally.\\nNow that we know how model theft occurs,\\nlet's switch to the strategies to secure your models.\\nFirst, rate-limit API access.\\nLimit the number of queries per user\\nor per IP to prevent excessive probing.\\n\\nUse API gateways like Nginx or Kong\\nto enforce throttling and quotas.\\nNext, reduce output precision.\\nAvoid exposing unnecessary details in the API responses.\\nReturn only the top predictions\\nor binary outcomes to minimize information leakage.\\nAs always, enable authentication and authorization.\\nUse appropriate role-based access control protocols\\nto grant appropriate access levels.\\n\\nUse strong encryption to protect model files at rest.\\nEnsure encryption keys are stored securely\\nin tools like HashiCorp Vault.\\nUse cryptographic hashes to verify the integrity\\nof the model files before deployment.\\nAnd lastly, embed watermarks in models.\\nInclude unique invisible watermarks in the model weights\\nor outputs

this video, we will address secure coding practices,\\ndependency management, and supply chain risks\\nwith an emphasis on AI ML lifecycle.\\n\\nLet's start with the first threat\\ncalled insecure data processing code.\\nIn machine learning, data pre-processing code is critical,\\nbut is often overlooked.\\nPoorly written program can allow malicious data inputs\\nsuch as poisoned or corrupted datasets\\nto flow into the pipeline.\\nFor example, unvalidated inputs might execute harmful logic\\nduring feature extraction or transformation.\\nNow, can you spot the security issue\\nin this example Python code?\\nThe script accepts file paths and formulas\\ndirectly from user input without any validation.\\n\\nThis allows attackers to provide malicious paths\\nor harmful commands in the formula input.\\nNext, the eval function, as you know,\\nis inherently insecure\\nas it executes any code provided by the user.\\nAn attacker could input a RM minus RF command,\\nwhich could delete all files on the server.\\nLast, the script assumes that the input file\\nis safe and correctly formatted.\\n\\nIf an attacker provides a malicious file,\\nit could lead to corrupted processing or crashes.\\nSo what the defender should do?\\nFirst, validate input data early and often.\\nPerform strict input validation for data formats,\\nvalues, and schemas before processing.\\nApply secure file handling.\\nUse libraries like pandas or NumPy securely\\nby validating file sources\\nand avoiding insecure functions like eval\\nthat could execute arbitrary code.\\n\\nRun static code

[Instructor] The threats to an AI system\\ncan be described as a three-tier model.\\nAt the bottom, we have the traditional cybersecurity threats\\nsuch as ransomware, unauthorized modification of data\\nfor which AI data sets is known as poisoning,\\ntheft of model files, and so on.\\nIt's at this tier that we have to protect our applications\\nfrom cyber attacks.\\nThe next tier up is specific to AI models,\\nfocusing on the threats from the AI models themselves.\\n\\nIt's all about responsible use,\\nwhich includes making sure the AI models we're using\\nin our applications aren't hallucinating or producing toxic,\\nharmful, or irrelevant information.\\nFinally, there are some very specific attacks\\ndirectly on the AI models\\nand typically through their prompt interface.\\nThese include prompt and thought injections\\nwhere an adversary will get the model to do things\\nit really shouldn't, like disclose sensitive information\\nor cause downstream compromises to internal systems.\\n\\nIt's also where attacks on the fabric\\nof the AI models themselves can take place,\\nsuch as inserting malicious code into the model.\\nThere are many threats relating to AI,\\nboth to the models themselves\\nas well as threats to our business reputation\\nas a result of misbehavior from our own\\nand our service provider's AI models.\\nOWASP has developed a top 10 list of threats as we see here.\\nPrompt injection is a high-profile attack.\\n\\nAnd is where an adversary uses the standard prompt input\\nto manipulate the way in which the AI model\\nresponds to a prompt.\\nIn particular, these injections are used\\nto try and get responses, which are normally denied,\\nsuch as extraction of sensitive material used\\nin the training of the model.\\nSensitive information loaded into an AI model\\ncan be extracted.\\nAnd so we might want to make sure that sensitive data\\nisn't used to train the model, or if it is,\\nthat it's blocked if the model includes it in its response.\\n\\nWithout such guardrails, it's possible that an adversary\\ncan manipulate their prompts to include sensitive data\\nin the response.\\nSupply chain has become a significant cybersecurity issue.\\nAnd this flows onto AI models.\\nIf we construct our models using components and data\\nfrom a commercial or open source supplier,\\nwe need to make sure these have not been compromised\\nas this would compromise our model.\\n\\nThe way an AI model operates is determined\\nby the data on which it's trained.\\nThis means that if an adversary can manipulate\\nthe training dataset, poisoning it in AI terms,\\nthen the AI model responses can be influenced\\nin a malicious way.\\nImproper output handling is a general threat\\nrelated to the responses generated by the AI model.\\n\\nThis covers how we confirm that it hasn't produced toxic\\nor harmful output, which may upset a user.\\nWhere we have a chain of models, it also includes checking\\nfor malicious output designed to compromise\\ndownstream systems such as opening back doors.\\nExcessive agency is a threat that's particularly relevant\\nin agentic systems where an AI model can take action.\\nAnd with too much power comes more dangerous impacts.\\n\\nFor example, an AI model which can issue a system command\\nwith superuser privileges could be manipulated\\ninto deleting or ransoming our critical files.\\nSystem prompt leakage is a new threat in 2025.\\nAnd refers to the threat where adversaries manipulate\\nthe model to extract the instructions used\\nto constrain the behavior of the model.\\nBy understanding these, adversaries can manipulate\\ntheir prompts to bypass them.\\n\\nIn addition, they may contain secrets or other information,\\nwhich, when discovered,\\ncan be used to facilitate other attacks.\\nVector and embedding weaknesses are another new threat\\nto enter the top 10 in 2025.\\nAnd refers to weaknesses in the protection afforded\\nto the generation, storage and retrieval of vectors\\nand embeddings, which will be used in the model.\\n\\nThis is particularly relevant\\nwhere retrieval augmented generation is done,\\nand these vectors and embeddings are stored\\nin an external vector database.\\nAdversaries may attempt to inject harmful content\\nor access them to extract sensitive information.\\nMisinformation isn't an external threat,\\nbut rather misbehavior of an AI model.\\nIt occurs when a model responds with false\\nor misleading information that appears credible.\\n\\nAn example of this is AI model hallucination,\\nwhich occurs when a model generates content\\nto fill gaps in their training data\\nusing statistical patterns\\nwithout truly understanding the content.\\nWhat comes out may be completely irrelevant or false.\\nUnbounded consumption, which can lead to excessive cost\\nor denial of service, is as much a problem for AI models\\nas it is for any IT system.\\n\\nBut AI models are particularly vulnerable\\nas uncontrolled models can be made to consume\\na lot of resources responding to prompts.\\nAnother framework for AI threats is the MITRE ATLAS Matrix.\\nThis has a more granular set of threats\\nand is more focused on external adversary attacks.\\nIt follows the standard attack process\\nstarting with reconnaissance\\nand progressing through initial access,\\nprivilege escalation, and through to persistence,\\nand finally, exfiltration.\\n\\nWe won't go through all of the entries,\\nbut let's take a look at some of them.\\nWe'll start with reconnaissance, active scanning.\\nThis is a simple description indicating that adversaries\\nmay probe our systems.\\nWe can look at a case study called ShadowRay.\\nAnd this describes an attack via the Ray Job API,\\nwhich can be detected during reconnaissance.\\n\\nUnder resource development,\\nwe can select Publish Poisoned Datasets.\\nAnd again, we have a case study shown.\\nAnd at the bottom, we can find two approaches\\nto mitigate this threat.\\nWe can see LLM prompt injection under a number of headings\\nincluding defense evasion.\\nAlso in this category, we can see LLM jailbreak.\\n\\nLet's have a look at it.\\nThis describes the process of running a prompt injection\\nto override any preset restrictions.\\nAnd below, we can see that generative AI guardrails\\nare one of our mitigations.\\nIn addition to the various phases of threats,\\nthe last column indicates the various impacts that can occur\\nas a result of AI model

identifying key stakeholders from IT,\\nlegal, risk management, data science, and public relations.\\nWe may also need to consider\\nhow involved in any response we would want representatives\\nfrom our AI supply chain to be,\\nservice providers, external model developers, and so on.\\n\\nA key position that we have\\nto define is the incident response team leader\\nwho will be critical in ensuring an effective response.\\nHaving identified the members of the team,\\nwe then need to define their roles\\nand responsibilities for the duration of the incident.\\nA key responsibility outside of the instant response team\\nis the senior executive who will be responsible\\nfor fronting up to the media should the incident escalate\\nto becoming a public issue.\\n\\nEnsuring this executive is fully informed\\nat all times will be the responsibility\\nof the incident team leader.\\nThe final activity in this step is to establish\\nhow we will access secure communications channels\\nwhen we activate the incident response team.\\nThis could be through using an existing,\\nsecure internal network, or we may want\\nto set up a secure messaging group that we can use.\\n\\nThe second step will be to ensure\\nthat we have an in-force incident response policy.\\nIf no such policy exists, then we'll need to develop,\\nseek approval, and publish one.\\nThe policy will need to refer to the procedures\\nfor detection, assessment, containment, recovery,\\nand review of the incident.\\nIt should define incident severity levels\\nand reporting requirements during and after the incident.\\nFrom a business perspective,\\nthere should be a business continuity plan,\\neither linked to or part of the incident response plan.\\n\\nIt's likely that an AI incident will require the AI system\\nto be taken offline\\nand we can't just invoke an equivalent standby system,\\nbut of course, it will have the same training data\\nand so the same issues.\\nThe third step is to understand the various risks\\naround the AI systems we have running.\\nThere may be existing AI risk assessments for each system,\\nand where there isn't one, we'll need to prepare one.\\nBy understanding the risks,\\nwe can prepare incident response plans, which cater for each\\nof the risk scenarios that are identified.\\n\\nWe'll cover the following activities in this step.\\nIdentify potential AI incident scenarios\\nbased on an initial assessment of the OWASP top 10 threats\\nto LLMs and the MITRE ATLAS framework.\\nFor each scenario identified, assess the impact\\nand likelihood and then select the risk level for those,\\ndocument, and then discard any which require no treatment.\\nPrioritize the risks that remain\\nfor treatment with the highest risk first.\\n\\nThese are the scenarios for which we need\\nto prepare an incident response plan.\\nThe last step is where we mitigate in advance any weaknesses\\nthat we can, and then prepare our detection capability\\nand response plan for the remaining scenarios.\\nThe first activity is to enhance our defensive controls\\nby implementing governance and ethical frameworks\\nand improving data security\\nand privacy controls where possible.\\nWe should also provide training and awareness programs\\nto ensure the relevant staff are aware of the scenarios\\nand understand how to respond to them.\\n\\nConducting regular testing\\nand audits will provide confidence\\nthat our defenses are effective\\nand highlight any areas\\nwhere they may require additional work.\\nAt this stage, we should also establish monitoring\\nand alerting systems for the scenarios we've identified\\nso that we can initiate our response as rapidly as possible.\\nA great source of collateral to assist\\nwith the general management\\nof incidents is incidentresponse.com.\\n\\nHere we can find free playbooks\\nfor the major cybersecurity incidents.\\nWhile there's no specifically AI content yet.\\nthese resources can assist\\nas we develop our AI collateral.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5233277\",\"duration\":180,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Upskilling

significant\\nnot only on the business, but also on its customers.\\n\\nAn AI crisis may not fit into one\\nof the standard categories of incidents and crisis scenarios\\nwith its unique blend of vulnerabilities and misbehaviors.\\nParticipation in an AI crisis exercise\\nshould include not only business owners,\\nrisk and technical staff,\\nbut also key public relations,\\ncustomer

includes public visibility\\nof the issue.\\nAn AI crisis exercise will run\\nas for any other crisis exercise,\\nbut we'll have a specific scenario based on a failure attack\\nor misbehavior of an AI system.\\n\\nThe scenario will be such\\nthat it has the potential to create\\nan enterprise-impacting crisis.\\nThe AI crisis exercise\\nshould be an immersive and evolving tabletop event\\nwhich tests the organization's strategic\\nand tactical response to an incident.\\nIt helps prepare for an attack\\nand assesses how well key staff make\\nand communicate vital decisions in a developing incident.\\n\\nAn AI crisis exercise\\nstarts with participants joining the exercise.\\nThe exercise may be run\\nwith participants together in a war room,\\nor virtually,\\nwith participants connecting into a virtual war room.\\nCrisis exercises are often run as manual exercises\\nwith each stage of the crisis being signaled\\nby what's called an inject being placed on the table\\nfor some or all of the participants to see.\\n\\nThe first inject will set the scene for the exercise\\nwith an issue being detected.\\nAt each inject, participants will respond\\nas if the events were

involved in an AI incident response\\nmaturity assessment\\nby using a maturity assessment tool developed\\nby the Australian Outpace folks.\\nI've already installed the tool, so let's get into it.\\nHere we have the main screen providing a short description\\nof the program and the seven phases\\nof AI maturity assessment questions, understand,\\nidentify, protect, prepare, respond,\\ncommunicate, and recover.\\n\\nWe can see that there's a demonstration assessment already\\nset up for us to look at.\\nLet's go to the scopes option.\\nThe tool can store multiple assessments each referred\\nto in the tool as a scope.\\nThese might be for a business unit\\nor division within an organization\\nor for the organization as a whole.\\nWe'll just check out the demonstration\\nscope currently loaded.\\nThe next option is questions.\\n\\nThis is the master list of questions\\nregarding areas which need to have a maturity assessment.\\nOne of five increasing levels of maturity can be selected.\\nLevel zero is not assessed.\\nLevel one is ad hoc,\\nwhich means there are no standard processes defined\\nand it may or may not happen.\\nLevel two is defined where there is a defined process\\nthat can be used, but there's no requirement\\nin policy to use it.\\n\\nLevel three is managed, meaning there's a policy requirement\\nto run the process, but there's no proactive monitoring\\nthat it's being used.\\nLevel four is monitored,\\nwhich means there's a policy requirement fraction\\nto be taken and its compliance is monitored\\nand level five is optimized, which adds to level four\\nby having regular review of the approach taken\\nto the issue in question.\\nWe currently have the first question selected.\\n\\nThe prefix 1.1 indicates this is phase one, question one.\\nWe can see the question\\nand the explanation of each of the five maturity levels.\\nLet's check out the range of questions loaded\\nby default in the tool.\\nWe can see the questions 1.1\\nto 1.7 from the understanding phase.\\nThese are focused on establishing how well the organization\\nor the part of the organization within scope understands AI.\\n\\nIt covers general staff awareness\\nand training of key personnel.\\nIt also covers our understanding of the criticality\\nand risk around AI systems\\nand the availability of AI policy\\nto underpin the organizational commitment\\nto this understanding.\\nThe second phase questions, 2.1 to 2.4,\\nare about identifying all usage\\nof AI within the organization.\\n\\nHere we have controls for managing the AI inventory as well\\nas running monitoring\\nand directory services to check on shadow AI\\nthat may have been introduced.\\nThe next phase covers the designed in protection\\nfor AI systems.\\nIn section three, we ask about the use\\nof guardrails within an AI application, applied pre\\nand post the AI model, as well as the scanning we may do\\nto confirm correct operation of the model.\\n\\nThe three questions in phase four cover the preparations\\nwe make for an incident.\\nThese include developing incident response plans\\nand establishing cyber drills and crisis exercises.\\nNext is where it all comes together and we detect\\nand have to respond to an AI incident.\\nHere we have the processes for monitoring\\nand detecting attacks and in the case of AI misbehavior,\\nand we also have the response processes\\nand management tooling.\\n\\nThe sixth phase covers our ability\\nto communicate effectively in the event of an AI incident.\\nIt's this point at which careers are made\\nor broken when senior executives have to stand up in front\\nof the world at large and explain why the incident occurred\\nand what we are doing about it.\\nAnd finally, we have the processes involved in recovery,\\nincluding business continuity\\nand disaster recovery for our AI systems.\\nThe assessments function\\nis where we record our assessment of maturity\\nfor each of the questions.\\n\\nWe'll enter a maturity level\\nand an optional explanatory comment.\\nWe'll typically load draft assessments and then confirm them\\nafter discussions with the business.\\nIn reports, we can select our scope\\nand get an overall assessment of maturity together\\nwith a detailed assessment for each of the questions.\\nWhether we use a tool such as this\\nor just run a manual assessment, it's important that we know\\nhow well prepared we are to respond to an incident\\nand have guidance on where we can improve in order\\nto minimize the damage should an

[Narrator] There may be a tendency to think of response\\nto an AI system malfunction as purely a technical issue,\\nbut in reality, AI systems are integrated\\ninto a complex organizational ethical\\nand legal business environment.\\nWhen an AI system misbehaves,\\nthe impacts can be multidimensional.\\nA recognized framework for incident response\\nis provided in the NIST Computer Security Incident\\nHandling Guide, and we can use that to help determine\\nwhat our AI incident response process should look like.\\n\\nHaving detected an issue and triaged it\\nto confirm it's an incident, we'll need to think\\nabout containment, eradication, and recovery.\\nHaving prepared for an AI incident, we'll be ready\\nto activate our AI incident response team\\nand pull the relevant AI incident response plan\\nthat we've practiced in crisis exercises many times.\\nThis, of course, is a best-case scenario,\\nbut it's one for which we need to strive.\\n\\nWe'll need to do a rapid initial impact assessment,\\nwhich delivers sufficient information to brief seniors\\nwho may be asked to front the media\\nor a government committee.\\nWe'll also brief them on any regulatory\\nor commercial issues that might be in play,\\nsuch as communicating the issue\\nto an upstream service provider.\\nFrom a technical perspective,\\nwe'll have a team running whatever forensics we can\\nto determine what happened and why, through to root cause.\\n\\nAs we move from detection to response,\\nwe need to consider how we contain the situation,\\nwhich may be a wider cyber incident started\\nthrough an initial attack on an AI model,\\nor it may be limited to the AI service itself.\\nIf it's resulted in a wider network issue,\\nthen the response will likely be managed\\nas a typical IT problem.\\nA key decision for an AI incident will be\\nwhether we keep the service running or shut it down.\\n\\nIf it's an isolated case of mildly inappropriate response\\nand we can't reproduce it,\\nwe may decide to let the service run.\\nIf it's a torrent of toxic material in the response,\\nthen we'd certainly want to terminate it\\nuntil we resolve the issue.\\nWe'll need to have a business continuity plan\\nalready prepared and able to be implemented\\nshould we decide to terminate the service.\\nOur primary reason for investigating\\nand gathering evidence during an incident\\nis to resolve the incident.\\n\\nHowever, when investigating an incident that has occurred\\nas a result of external malicious activity,\\nwe may want in addition to collect\\nand preserve evidence for subsequent court proceedings.\\nIn such cases, evidence will need to be collected\\naccording to procedures that meet all applicable laws\\nso that it will be admissible in court.\\nA detailed chain of custody log should be kept.\\nFor incidents due to an AI model misbehaving,\\nthe issues are much different.\\n\\nHere we need to be able to track back\\nfrom the model response to the prompt which caused it,\\nand to any augmentation data used to process the prompt.\\nWe need to have details of any fine-tuning that's occurred,\\nas well as details of the original training\\nor the pre-trained model\\nthat was used in case the underlying model is flawed.\\nWith all this information, we can start\\nto unravel the reasons for the AI misbehaving.\\n\\nWhile understanding why the issue occurred is critical,\\nit's also very important to understand\\nwhat can be done to mitigate any harm.\\nIn analysis of 100 incidents, trustable.ai identified\\nthe top 10 follow-on actions shown here.\\nWe can see a significant focus in the incident surveyed\\nis correcting the issue in the model,\\nincluding adding guardrails, followed by apologizing.\\nIt's important to note that a

[Instructor] While the initial deployments of AI chatbots\\nand AI-enabled applications have made a big impact,\\nthey haven't been a total success.\\nWe've rapidly learned about some of the shortcomings\\nin AI models,\\nsuch as toxicity and hallucination,\\nas well as some of the vulnerabilities\\nto which they can fall prey,\\nsuch as prompt and code injections.\\nBefore we get into these,\\nlet's take a look at what an AI model is in simple terms.\\nAt the heart of the AI model\\nis a series of what are called vectors,\\nmulti-dimensional arrays of numbers\\ncontaining what in essence are probabilities.\\n\\nAI models work through numbers,\\nso when we talk to an AI model,\\nit converts our words into numbers,\\ntokens in AI terminology,\\nand it then ingests them.\\nThis representation of our inputs,\\ncalled a prompt in AI terminology,\\nthen passes through the vectors\\nusing some form of algorithm,\\nand a set of tokens is output.\\nThese tokens are turned back to words,\\nand we have our response.\\nIf we want to dig deeper into the model,\\nwe can look at the actual construction of an AI model.\\n\\nThis involves a series of components\\nthat process our token string,\\nstarting with the process of token embedding,\\nwhich turns the token number\\ninto a set of probabilities across a vector.\\nThere's a number of additional processing steps\\nthrough the layers of the model\\nuntil we come to the feed forward,\\nwhich outputs the token string.\\nWe won't go into the data science behind this,\\nbut if you're interested in learning\\nabout the actual maths of the AI model,\\ndo take a look at the other courses you'll find\\nin the AI and data science parts\\nof the LinkedIn Learning Library.\\n\\nAnother key question with an AI model\\nis how did those vectors get in there?\\nThe answer is that the model was trained.\\nLet's consider a language model.\\nWe take a large amount of text,\\nknown as a training dataset,\\nbreak it down into smaller pieces, such as a page.\\nThese are called batches in AI terminology.\\nThese are then tokenized\\nand embedded into the model using a training algorithm,\\nwhich increasingly refines\\nthe default set of probabilities in the vectors.\\n\\nIn practice, we need to have two additional sets of data,\\nwhich we can take from the dataset.\\nOne is for testing as we're developing our application,\\nand the second is for validation\\nto confirm that the model\\nis delivering acceptable results when used.\\nAI models don't only work on text,\\nthey can work on audio and images too.\\nThe way they work is pretty much the same,\\nalthough the token may have multiple components,\\nnumbers representing red, green, and blue for a pixel\\nin the case of an image\\nand frequency, pitch, and timbre in the case of audio.\\n\\nOf course, there are many different tokenization techniques,\\neach with its own form of token,\\nso we might ask,\\nwhere does security fit into this process?\\nWell, if we look at the lifecycle of an AI model,\\nwe can see that it starts with understanding the problem\\nand then determining where to find the dataset\\nto enable us to build the model.\\nThis is followed by encoding the dataset\\ninto the most suitable form for training\\nand then using it to train the model.\\nAt this stage, we'll need to secure the dataset\\nas any malicious changes made to the dataset\\nwill affect how the model works or if it works at all.\\n\\nOnce the model's been trained,\\nit can then be validated\\nto ensure that it works properly and then deployed.\\nAt this point, we need to be concerned\\nabout securing the validation data\\nand the model itself.\\nFinally, we need to audit the operation of the model\\nand if required, update the dataset and retrain it.\\nSadly, we've seen plenty of incidents involving AI models.\\nHere, an initial deployment of a chatbot\\ncalled Tay by Microsoft\\ncaused a furore when it started producing toxic content.\\n\\nIn another incident,\\nthe chatbot used by Canadian Airlines\\ngave a passenger wrong advice,\\nand the airline was made to stand\\nby what the chatbot advised.\\nIn another incident, lawyers used the chatbot\\nto generate precedents to take to court,\\nbut the opposing counsel identified them\\nas hallucinated content.\\nIf we're to be able to gain the value that's promised by AI,\\nwe need to have safe and responsible AI models to use,\\nand that's what we'll cover in this course.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5227269\",\"duration\":239,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Security testing for AI

models.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":18940278,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\"- [Instructor] There are many threats relating to AI,\\nboth to the models themselves,\\nas well as threats to our business reputation\\nfrom our own and our service providers' AI models.\\nOWASP has developed a top 10 list of threats\\nas we can see here.\\nThe first is Prompt Injection.\\nPrompt injection is a high-profile attack\\nand occurs when an adversary uses the standard prompt input\\nto manipulate the way in which the AI model\\nresponds to a prompt.\\n\\nIn particular, these injections are used to try\\nand get responses, which are normally denied,\\nsuch as extraction of sensitive material\\nused in the training of the model.\\nThe next is Sensitive Information Disclosure.\\nSensitive information loaded into an AI model\\ncan be extracted, and so we might want to make sure\\nthat sensitive data isn't used to train the model,\\nor if it is, that it's blocked if the model includes it\\nin its response.\\nWithout these guardrails, it's possible\\nthat an adversary can manipulate their prompts\\nto include sensitive data in the response.\\n\\nLLMO3 is Supply Chain.\\nSupply chain has become a significant cybersecurity issue,\\nand this flows on to AI models.\\nIf we construct our models using components\\nand data from a commercial or open-source supplier,\\nwe need to make sure these have not been compromised\\nas this would compromise our model.\\nAnother threat we have to consider\\nis Data and Model Poisoning.\\nThe way an AI model operates is determined\\nby the data on which it's trained.\\n\\nThis means that if an adversary can manipulate\\nthe training dataset, or poisoning it in AI terms,\\nthen the AI model responses can be influenced\\nin a malicious way.\\nAnother threat we have to consider\\nis Improper Output Handling.\\nThis is a general threat related to the responses generated\\nby the AI model.\\nIt covers how we confirm\\nthat the model hasn't produced toxic\\nor harmful output, which may upset a user.\\nIt also includes checking for malicious output\\ndesigned to compromise downstream systems,\\nsuch as opening back doors.\\n\\nExcessive agency is a threat\\nthat is particularly relevant in Agentic systems.\\nThese are systems where an AI model can take action,\\nand with too much power comes more dangerous impacts.\\nFor example, an AI model which can issue a system command\\nwith super-user privileges could be manipulated\\ninto deleting or ransoming our critical files.\\nLLMO7 is System Prompt Leakage.\\n\\nThis is a new threat in 2025 and refers to the threat\\nof adversaries manipulating the model\\nto extract the instructions used\\nto constrain the behavior of the model.\\nBy understanding these,\\nadversaries can manipulate their prompts to bypass them.\\nIn addition, they may contain secrets or other information,\\nwhich, when discovered,\\ncould be used to facilitate other attacks.\\nVector and Embedding Weaknesses, LLMO8,\\nare another new threat to enter the top 10 in 2025.\\n\\nThese refer to weaknesses in the protection afforded\\nto the generation, storage and retrieval of vectors\\nand embeddings, which will be used in the model.\\nThis is particularly relevant\\nwhere retrieval-augmented generation is done\\nand these vectors and embeddings are stored\\nin an external vector database.\\nAdversaries may attempt to inject harmful content\\nor access them to extract sensitive information.\\nLLMO9 is Misinformation.\\n\\nMisinformation isn't an external threat,\\nbut, rather, misbehavior of an AI model.\\nIt occurs when a model responds with faults\\nor misleading information that appears credible.\\nAn example of this is AI model hallucination,\\nwhich occurs when a model generates content\\nto fill gaps in their training data,\\nusing statistical patterns.\\nWithout truly understanding the content,\\nwhat comes out may be completely irrelevant\\nor, at best, false.\\n\\nThe final OWASP Top 10 threat is Unbounded Consumption.\\nThis is the threat where use of an AI system leads\\nto excessive cost or denial of service,\\nand it's as much a problem for AI models\\nas it is for any IT system,\\nbut AI models are particularly vulnerable\\nas uncontrolled models can be made to consume\\na lot of resources responding to prompts.\\nAnother framework for AI threats is the MITRE ATLAS Matrix.\\n\\nThis has a more granular set of threats,\\nbut is more focused on external adversary attacks.\\nIt follows the standard attack process,\\nstarting with Reconnaissance\\nand progressing through Initial Access,\\nPrivilege Escalation, and through to Persistence.\\nWe won't go through all of the entries,\\nbut let's take a look at some of them.\\nWe'll start with Reconnaissance, active scanning.\\nThis is a simple description indicating\\nthat adversaries may probe our systems.\\n\\nWe can look at a case study, ShadowRay,\\nand this describes an attack via the Ray Job API,\\nwhich can be detected during reconnaissance.\\nUnder Resource Development,\\nwe can select Publish Poisoned Datasets,\\nand, again, we have a case study shown.\\nIf we scroll down further, we find two approaches\\nto mitigate this threat.\\nWe can see LLM Prompt Injection under a number of headings,\\nincluding Defensive Evasion.\\n\\nAlso in this category we can see LLM Jailbreak.\\nLet's have a look at it.\\nThis describes the process of running a prompt injection\\nto override any preset restrictions.\\nBelow, we see that generative AI guardrails\\nare our mitigation.\\nIn addition to the threats,\\nthe last column indicates the various impacts that can occur\\nas a result of AI model compromise.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5231231\",\"duration\":175,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Testing requirements in AI
