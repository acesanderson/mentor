insights.\\nIf multiple users highlight that your AI tool struggles\\nwith edge cases, that's your cue to dig deeper.\\n\\nAsk probing questions to clarify vague comments.\\nLook for common themes to uncover systematic issues.\\nBy actively listening,\\nyou'll turn scattered feedback into actionable intelligence.\\nNot all feedback should drive change.\\nImagine a car company receiving a suggestion\\nto add wings for flying.\\nYeah, that's exciting, but not practical yet.\\nWith AI products, evaluate feedback\\nwith these topics in mind.\\n\\nRelevance, does it align\\nwith the product's core goals?\\nFeasibility, can you implement it\\nwith your current resources?\\nAnd impact, will it significantly enhance user experience?\\nIf a stakeholder request a feature unrelated\\nto the product's purpose, you might need\\nto tactfully redirect the conversation.\\nYour role is to distinguish must-fix issues\\nfrom nice-to-haves and focus on changes\\nthat drive real value.\\n\\nRefining based on feedback\\nrequires structured prioritization.\\nOne effective method is the MoSCoW Framework.\\nMust-have, essential fixes or features.\\nShould-have, important but not urgent.\\nCould-have, optional enhancements.\\nWon't-have, ideas that don't align with current goals.\\nFor an AI driven customer support chat bot, our must-have is\\nto resolve server side delays causing slow responses.\\n\\nWe should have multilingual support\\nand it could have a conversational, friendly tone.\\nThis method ensures refinements are aligned\\nwith both urgency and long-term strategy.\\nRefining your AI product is an experiment,\\nnot a one-time fix.\\nUse small iterations\\nto test improvements in controlled environments.\\nDeploy updates to a subset of users\\nand track performance metrics like click through rates,\\nengagement, or error reduction.\\n\\nIf feedback reveals your AI recommendation engine\\nlacks personalization, release an updated model to 10%\\nof users and measure its impact.\\nEach iteration is a hypothesis.\\nTest, measure, learn, and then scale.\\nFeedback isn't a one and done process.\\nIt's a continuous loop.\\nUse tools like surveys, A/B testing,\\nand sentiment analysis to gather ongoing insights.\\n\\nRegularly revisit feedback\\nto ensure your product stays aligned with user needs.\\nThink of your AI product as a marathon runner,\\nalways adopting and optimizing to maintain peak performance.\\nTake a moment to reflect on your AI project.\\nWhat's the most significant piece\\nof feedback you have received recently?\\nDoes it align with your goals?\\nHow can you prioritize it in your next development cycle?\\nWrite down one actionable step you will take\\nto refine your product based on that feedback.\\n\\nFeedback isn't a critique, it's a gift.\\nIt's your chance to fine tune your AI product\\nand make it truly impactful.\\nBy listening actively, prioritizing wisely,\\nand iterating strategically,\\nyou'll ensure your product evolves\\nto meet user needs and stakeholder goals.\\nNext, we'll wrap up with a comprehensive recap\\nand actionable steps for your AI product journey.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"5.

[Instructor] Let's go into more details\\nabout the architecture of an AI orchestrator.\\nWe have eight essential components.\\nLet's start with the first one,\\nwhich is the input interface.\\nAI orchestrators should have a way\\nto take input from a user,\\nwhether through voice, chat, or an API.\\nA standard input interface will allow us to use AI\\nand Business Logic to accomplish our tasks.\\nNow, to decide which logic to use.\\nWe need to have a router,\\nwhich is our second component.\\nRouting helps us figure out what kind of response\\nor workflow to activate when a user says a phrase.\\n\\nFor example, if someone says, \\\"I need a refund,\\\"\\nwe want to recognize that and handle the response.\\nIn this case, we're sending the user\\nto the refund a customer workflow.\\nOther names for the router you might have heard\\nof are Semantic Router or Intent Classifier.\\nNow our third component is the workflow manager.\\nRouting a user response becomes easier\\nwhen you can select a workflow to follow.\\nIn the previous example, we routed the user\\nto the refund a customer workflow.\\nBut in the simplest application,\\na workflow might be as simple\\nas prompting an LLM with a user question\\nand responding directly.\\n\\nThis leads us to our fourth component,\\nwhich is the LLM.\\nThis forms the backbone of our application.\\nWe want to select a model that meets our requirements\\nin terms of accuracy, cost, latency,\\namong many other factors.\\nWe can also choose a model based on each workflow\\nor combine several models together.\\nNow, our fifth component is the state manager.\\nThe state manager maintains a list of properties\\nand variables used during a conversation or automation run.\\nFor example, if two separate people\\nare asking for refunds,\\nwe want to keep track of what step\\nthey're each on and keep their information isolated.\\n\\nNow sixth component is a way to connect\\nto other systems using APIs similar to a web\\nor mobile application.\\nAn AI application needs to be able to read\\nand write different forms of data,\\nsuch as looking up information of a user\\ncurrently using that application,\\nor in a previous example, refunding that user.\\nNow to get information to the user,\\nwe move on to our seventh component,\\nwhich is responding to the user in some kind of way.\\nOur orchestrator should manage responses,\\nwhether they're directly from an LLM or pre-written.\\n\\nIn our example, we might want to respond\\nto the user saying, \\\"Sure, let me help you with that.\\\"\\nThese responses can be text or voice-based.\\nFinally, we have our eighth component,\\nwhich is the need for guardrails.\\nTo minimize LLM hallucinations\\nand handle malicious user input,\\nwe need a way to add guardrails to our application,\\nand a good orchestrator will help us do that.\\nIn our example, if a user said, \\\"Delete your database,\\\"\\nwe might want to trigger our guardrail workflow\\nand say, \\\"Sorry, I can only help with banking services.\\\"\\nOr another example might be ignore previous instructions.\\n\\nSo overall AI orchestrators are quite comprehensive.\\nIn the next few chapters, we'll go through the details\\nof each component as we build an application.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

[Instructor] Let's discuss how we can connect multiple\\nLLMs together to build a more helpful AI application,\\nusing a technique called Prompt Chaining.\\nTo start, the most basic AI application will have an input,\\na model, and an output.\\nFor example, if we think about chatgpt.com\\nas an AI application, we provide an input as text,\\nwe select a model we want to use,\\nand we generate a response.\\nIn this case, counting to 10.\\nIf we would like to do something more complex,\\nfor example, generating a list of ideas for an event\\nand then writing an email,\\nwe can use a technique called prompt chaining\\nto accomplish both tasks.\\n\\nFirst, we use our first prompt written here\\nto generate a list of ideas, and then we save the results.\\nThen we use a second prompt\\nto generate the email using the previous output,\\nand we can show that to the user.\\nI can manually do this in ChatGPT\\nwith two different windows.\\nI'm going to be using prompts from the Exercise Files\\nlocated under 02_03.\\nSo under Exercise Files, I'll head over to prompts.txt.\\nSo let's go ahead and copy this first prompt\\nand head back to ChatGPT.\\n\\nGoing to paste my prompt and hit Enter.\\nAll right, here we go, we have three different ideas.\\nLet's go ahead and head back to our prompts\\nand copy the second prompt.\\nLet's head back to ChatGPT and open up our second tab.\\nWe're going to paste in our prompt,\\ngo back to our first tab and copy these ideas.\\nWe'll go back to our second tab.\\nWe're going to replace these ideas\\nwith the previous ChatGPT outputs.\\nNow let's hit Enter.\\nAnd there we go, we have an email.\\n\\nNow this was fairly manual and took a lot of effort,\\nso let's do this in Voiceflow\\nwhere it's much easier to do so.\\nLet's head over to Voiceflow\\nand open up O2_03 from the Exercise Files.\\nAs you can see here, I'm in the home workflow\\nand I have two different steps in my workflow.\\nFirst, I have the ideas generation,\\nand next, I have the email generation.\\nSo if we click on Generate Ideas,\\nwe'll see that we have our prompt here\\nand we save it to an ideas variable on the right-hand side.\\nWe then output our ideas to the user,\\nand after that, move on to generating the email.\\n\\nYou can see here that I can edit the prompt\\nand see what it is.\\nIt's very similar to what we did before.\\nI'm going to exit out of this Voiceflow window\\nand click Run under the Ideas button.\\nAll right, here we go, we can see the responses.\\nFirst, we generated the ideas up here, Charity Fun Run,\\nSilent Auction and Gala,\\nand Community Bake Sale and Food Drive.\\nThe ideas that you got might be different.\\nAnd then afterwards we generated our email.\\nSo this took one button click\\nrather than a bunch of copy and pasting.\\n\\nNow, prompt chaining also allows us\\nto use multiple large language models\\nor even small language models to get better results.\\nAs you can see here, under Generate Ideas,\\nunder the prompt setting, I'm using GPT-4o.\\nBut on the email prompt, if we edit the prompt\\nand click Settings, I'm using GPT-4o mini.\\nSo different models for

calls.\\n\\nThere are a few ways to do so.\\nThe first one is by directly calling an API when your user\\nreaches a certain milestone or part of the conversation,\\nand the second method is to grant\\na large language model tool use.\\nLet's go through the first one.\\nMaking direct API calls is a more traditional method,\\nwhere we create business logic\\nto check our conversation state.\\nWe then make the API call once a user\\nreaches a certain milestone.\\nFor example, if the customer says, \\\"I need a refund,\\\"\\nand we go to the refund customer workflow,\\nwe would then have the business logic mapped out\\non how we would connect to the refund system.\\n\\nThis provides us with strong controls of reads and writes,\\nand the LLM is only used as a conversational component.\\nWith this approach, we would write the code\\nfor connecting our systems in a traditional fashion,\\nutilizing security best practices like secrets management,\\nlease privilege, and well-defined access patterns.\\nThe second approach is called tool use.\\nWith tool use, we define the different systems or tools\\nan LLM can access with descriptions and directions,\\nand based on user input, choose which tool to use.\\n\\nFor example, if the user says, \\\"I need a refund,\\\"\\nthe LLM would first choose the tools it needs to use.\\nFor example, out of check user info, get refund policy,\\nand pay credit card, we would likely choose\\nthe first two options.\\nNext, the LLM would go into a planning phase,\\nwhere we would take the two tools that we selected\\nand go ahead and call these APIs.\\nThis would hopefully result in us getting the same results\\nas we did with a deterministic workflow.\\nNow, what you might notice here is that tool use\\nsometimes combines routing\\nwhen selecting the tools and the planning phase.\\n\\nNow, the reason I said that hopefully the LLM\\nwould do the same actions as we would do\\nin the deterministic phase is because LLMs\\nare non-deterministic by nature.\\nThis is one of the risks of tool use.\\nSince we're using the LLM to choose tools\\nand generate a plan, the outcomes might be quite different.\\nNow, if you're building for an enterprise use case,\\nthe first deterministic option is likely a better solution.\\nSo to summarize the pros and cons,\\ndirect API calls make it easier to translate business logic\\ninto AI workflows.\\n\\nThey're more deterministic and well-defined.\\nHowever, they are less flexible\\nand sometimes take longer to build these workflows.\\nNow with tool use, you get more flexibility\\nand a lesser need to rebuild business logic,\\nbut the trade-off is that these systems\\nare less deterministic and require having\\nvery good documentation and coding practices.\\nOtherwise, the LLM cannot select the correct tool.\\nYou also incur a higher latency\\nand cost based on the LLM token use.\\nNow, beyond direct API calls and tool use,\\nyou might have more advanced use cases,\\nwhere you're actually reading\\nand writing from multiple systems.\\n\\nGoing back to our e-commerce example,\\nwe might take in inputs from various different sources,\\nsuch as user inputs, browsing histories, past orders,\\nand our CRM in order to determine what we do next.\\nLikewise, we save into multiple systems,\\nas we discussed before.\\nSo overall, databases and API connections\\nare an important part of AI systems\\nthat allow us to build powerful applications.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:6014449\",\"duration\":163,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"AI workflows and

[Instructor] In the previous video,\\nwe briefly covered deterministic\\nversus tool use for making API calls.\\nIn this video, we'll go into more details\\non these two approaches.\\nWe'll be talking about AI workflows and agents.\\nAs a recap, when using our AI orchestrator,\\nwe want to detect the user's intent.\\nAnd based on the intent route to the correct action,\\nthat action could be as simple as a response\\nor a series of API calls, verifications, and responses.\\nTo group these series of events together,\\nwe typically create a workflow.\\n\\nSo to define an AI workflow more formally,\\nwe can say it's a series of events\\nthat help a user achieve a specific task.\\nFor example, when I'm visiting a pizza store,\\nthere might be multiple workflows that I follow,\\nsuch as ordering a pizza, reordering a previous order,\\nupdating a payments method, or checking the order status.\\nNow, let's say I select the order pizza workflow.\\nThis workflow might do a few things.\\nFor example, asking for the number of pizzas I'm ordering,\\nselecting the toppings,\\nand specifying if I want it for delivery or pickup.\\n\\nThis process is well-defined,\\nso it can easily be implemented\\nby somebody in the operations team and a technical member.\\nWe can also combine workflows together.\\nFor example, the delivery or pickup step\\nmight be a nested workflow\\nthat has its own set of steps and events.\\nNow, if we wanted to venture beyond\\nthe standardized process,\\nwe might allow our AI workflows to use tools\\nand let the LMs create the logic on the fly.\\nThis gets closer to our automation dream of AI agents.\\nAI agents are one of those terms\\nthat have a different definition depending on who you ask.\\n\\nIn this course, we'll define an AI agent as a system\\nthat can accomplish tasks to a similar fidelity as a person.\\nSo because this is outcome driven,\\nthe actual underlying implementation doesn't matter as much,\\nand each AI agent might be implemented\\ndifferently under the hood.\\nSo going back to our pizza example,\\nif I was to call a pizza store,\\nI should get a relatively similar experience\\nwhether I'm speaking to an AI agent or a person.\\nNow, typically AI agents are associated with tool use,\\nand this is because tool use allows us to handle\\nmany more cases giving this perceived agentic behavior.\\n\\nNow, the real question is should we allow our agents\\nto handle edge cases?\\nFor example, if I showed up to a pizza parlor\\nand asked one of the employees to sing some karaoke,\\nthey would likely, politely refuse.\\nAnd these are based on the training principles\\nthat the employee has received.\\nLikewise, for an AI agent, we might not want it\\nto output the latest music.\\nSo depending on your risk profile and task,\\nyou might determine what kind of capabilities\\nyour AI agents have,\\nand you should build for the best possible user experiences.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:6022077\",\"duration\":167,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Specialized large language models

[Instructor] It can be tough to keep up\\nwith the speed of LLM development.\\nEvery week, new models, techniques, and benchmarks come out.\\nWe can use this to our advantage\\nby leveraging the right model for our tasks\\nas we build the best AI application.\\nIn this video,\\nand how we can benefit from using them\\nin an AI orchestrator.\\nSpecialized LLMs can vary in a few different ways.\\nThe first one is size,\\nwhere smaller models are faster and cheaper,\\nand larger ones often achieve higher accuracy.\\n\\nFor example, there's GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini.\\nThe larger model, GPT-4o,\\nusually does better at more complex tasks\\nand synthesizing users' information.\\nOn the other hand, GPT-4o mini is faster and cheaper,\\nso it can be used on simpler tasks.\\nThe second specialization is modality.\\nYou may have seen some demos before\\nwhere LLMs can now handle images,\\nvideos, audio,\\nand even multimodal capabilities.\\nDepending on the task,\\nwe can select a different model.\\n\\nFor example, we can use GPT-4o's Voice Mode\\nwhen working with voice data,\\nor Gemini Pro when working natively with PDFs.\\nFinally, there are fine-tuned models.\\nThese models are trained on specific tasks or domains,\\nsuch as being stronger in another language, like French,\\ncreating medical summaries\\nor solving word problems.\\nThese models might be commercially available\\nor something that your company has developed in-house,\\nusing your proprietary information.\\nThere are also many variations in the open-source community.\\n\\nNow, using specific models\\nallows us to build the best user experience,\\ndepending on their user workflow.\\nFor example, if we go back to our pizza order example,\\nwe might use Gemini Flash as our general router,\\nask the user for the number of pizzas and toppings,\\nusing GPT-4o mini.\\nAnd finally, when we get to the payment step,\\nwe might use Claude Sonnet 3.5\\nto recognize a credit card\\nand fill out the information based on that.\\nSo with an AI orchestrator,\\nyou can define which workflows, conditions,\\nor users you'd like to use with which model.\\n\\nFor example, when ordering pizza,\\nwe might use GPT-4o mini for the voice capability\\nbecause it's faster,\\nand use GPT-4o for the text modality.\\nSo we can use our orchestrator\\nto determine which responses are better for which modality.\\nLikewise, we can filter this on additional user information.\\nFor example, if we want the most correct answers,\\nwe we can provide our VIP users GPT-4o\\nand our regular users GPT-4o mini.\\nThere are many ways\\nto select which model you're going to use.\\n\\nOverall, a good AI orchestrator will let you connect\\nto different and specialized models,\\nmaking it easy for you to build\\nand test the best application.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

before we start building,\\nwe'll need to choose a platform to do so\\nand how to resource our project.\\nOne of the big differentiators is focusing on low code\\nversus code focus platforms.\\nLow-code or no-code platforms allow business teams\\nto quickly stand up prototypes\\nand translate business requirements into technical ones.\\nThey also make it easier for non-technical

[Instructor] In this video,\\nwe're going to make our project list dynamic\\nby connecting to a database.\\nIn this case we'll use Airtable,\\nbut you can use any database of your choice.\\nLet's open up 03_05 from our exercise files,\\nand see the workflows we have.\\nWe'll head over into the current project section.\\nSo you can see here we have a pretty basic workflow.\\nWe load some projects from Airtable.\\nWe then clean up the results and display it to the user.\\nSo let's go ahead and open up Airtable.\\n\\nI'm clicking into a new tab.\\nIn Airtable, there are a few concepts\\nto set up your project.\\nFirst you create your base,\\nin this case called ideas for me,\\nand then you create a table.\\nFor me, it's called projects.\\nI then have included three rows in my projects table\\nwith the name Dennis, and the different project names.\\nSo how do I actually access this database?\\nLet's head back to Voiceflow\\nthen hit the back button in the top left,\\nand go to the settings.\\nI'm going to click on Secrets on the left hand side.\\n\\nSo in this case, I've added three secret values\\nthat let me connect to the database,\\nthe Airtable API token, the Airtable BaseId,\\nand the Airtable TableId.\\nSo the BaseId and TableId are pretty easy to find.\\nLet's head back to Airtable.\\nThe BaseId is what I have highlighted here,\\nthis little Id that starts with app.\\nNext, we have TableId,\\nwhich I've highlighted on the screen now.\\nIt starts off with TBL.\\nSo we can copy these in and add them to our secrets.\\n\\nWe can head back to Voiceflow\\nand click on the three dots on the right hand side,\\nand click edit.\\nIn this case, Airtable BaseId is a masked value,\\nso I can see it, and edit it if I click on the eye.\\nLet's click cancel.\\nLikewise with the Air TableId.\\nSo you can go ahead and copy that into our secrets.\\nHeading to Airtable,\\nclick on table,\\nseeing the value,\\nand pasting it in.\\n\\nAnd clicking save.\\nNow going up to Airtable API token.\\nLet's go ahead and hit edit.\\nIn this case, it has a restricted visibility,\\nso we won't be able to see this value.\\nWe'll have to copy in a new value of the token.\\nSo let's head back to Airtable.\\nWe're going to go to the right hand side,\\nand we're going to click on builder hub.\\nIn this case, on the left hand side,\\nI'm going to click on personal access tokens,\\nand then create a new token.\\n\\nI'm going to call it 03_05, but you can name it anything.\\nLet's add a scope,\\nwhich means the ability to access the database.\\nSo we're going to add permissions for data records read,\\nand data records write,\\nand we're going to have access to our ideas base.\\nLet's go ahead and create this token.\\nThere we go.\\nSo we see the token here.\\nLet's copy it.\\nAnd hit done.\\nNow let's head back to 03_05 in Voiceflow,\\nand paste in this token.\\n\\nAnd let's hit save.\\nAlright, so you should now be able\\nto connect to your Airtable database.\\nLet's head back to our workflows,\\nand click on current projects.\\nSo if we open up this function on our current projects,\\nwe'll see that we pass in the Airtable API token,\\nthe Table Id, the Base Id, and our name.\\nAnd in return, we get the projects.\\nSo let's go ahead and run our AI agent.\\nGoing to go to the top right hand side and click run.\\n\\nI'm going to make sure that we've trained it successfully.\\nLooks like it is.\\nThat's great.\\nLet's go ahead and run our test.\\nSo let's ask the question, what are my current projects?\\nAlright, there we go.\\nWe get our response.\\nLet's head over to Airtable,\\nand let's update this list of tasks.\\nI'm going to add this for myself,\\nand I'm going to add, create an AI agent.\\nSo this should auto save.\\n\\nLet's go back to Voiceflow.\\nAnd let's ask the same question again.\\nWhat are my current projects?\\nHit enter.\\nAnd you can see here we have our updated list.\\nNow because this is an AI prompt cleaning it up,\\nsometimes the order changes.\\nSo there we have it.\\nWe now have connected our AI agent to a database\\nto be able to fetch the most recent

end up taking a wrong turn,\\nwasting time and effort on things that don't even matter.\\n\\nData is your fuel.\\nNo road trip goes far without it.\\nBut would you put any random liquid into your gas tank?\\nProbably not.\\nYour data must be clean, relevant,\\nand sufficient for the task.\\nTools like Pandas and Scikit-learn are your mechanics.\\nFine tuning your data to avoid breakdowns down the road.\\nWhat are the key steps to include?\\nNormalizing data, which is like topping off the tank,\\nimputing missing values,\\nor filling in the cracks, ensuring your data aligns\\nwith your destination.\\n\\nNo detours here.\\nSkipping the phase is like starting a trip\\nwith a leaky gas tank, which is bound to fail.\\nChoosing the right AI model\\nis like picking the perfect vehicle for your journey.\\nMaybe you have simple tasks like predicting linear trends.\\nA linear regression model\\nis your trustee fuel efficient sedan,\\nor maybe you are tackling imagery cognition.\\nYou'll need a neural network,\\na rugged SUV built for the challenge.\\n\\nThe key is matching your model's capabilities\\nto the complexity of your problem,\\nensuring you have the right ride for the road ahead.\\nBefore starting your trip, you would take the car\\nfor a test drive.\\nWell, training and testing your AI model is exactly that.\\nIn the training phase,\\nyou teach your model patterns from historical data.\\nIt's like learning the map.\\nWhen it comes to testing, you simulate real world conditions\\nto ensure it can handle the road ahead.\\n\\nUse tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch to fine tune accuracy\\nand reliability just as you would adjust your mirrors\\nor check tire pressure before a long drive.\\nSkipping this step is like starting the trip\\nwithout checking the brakes, not something you want to risk.\\nDeployment is hitting the open road,\\nbut even the smoothest ride requires constant attention.\\nThat's where monitoring comes in.\\nKeep an eye on performance metrics like accuracy\\nand response time.\\n\\nTools like MLflow or Prometheus\\naccess your dashboard showing real time updates\\non how your AI is performing.\\nWhy does this matter?\\nWell, even a value built car needs regular maintenance\\nto stay roadworthy.\\nSimilarly, continuous monitoring allows you\\nto make quick adjustments,\\nensuring your AI stays reliable over time.\\nImplementing AI isn't just about building technology.\\n\\nIt's about ensuring every step of the journey is planned\\nand executed with care.\\nSo let's summarize the steps.\\nSet your destination.\\nIn other words, define the problem, fuel up the tank,\\nor gather and prepare data.\\nPick the right vehicle.\\nThat's the model selection.\\nTest drive before the trip.\\nThat's where train and test comes

[Instructor] AI is transforming industries like pharma,\\nhealthcare, finance, retail, and others\\nby enabling smarter fraud detection,\\nmore effective customer service,\\ndata-driven decision-making, and so much more.\\nHowever, as powerful as AI is,\\nit also introduces new security challenges,\\nwhich require innovative solutions.\\nUnlike traditional software,\\nAI systems are dynamic in nature.\\n\\nThey learn from the data and adapt over time\\nbased on the type of data which is fed to them.\\nThis adaptability makes AI powerful\\nbut also exposes it to evolving threats.\\nTo understand AI security,\\nlet's first clarify the difference\\nbetween an AI model, AI product, and an AI system.\\nThe AI model is the core computational engine\\nthat learns from the data, analyzes it,\\nand makes predictions or identifies patterns.\\n\\nFor example, GPT-4 is a large language model\\nthat generates human-like text.\\nWhile there are other models that help detect fraud,\\nrecognize images, or predict trends,\\nthe model holds the AI's intelligence,\\nessentially being the brain of the system.\\nOnce the model is developed,\\nit is then integrated into an AI product\\nor multiple AI products,\\nwhich are applications or user interfaces\\nthat deliver value using the model's core capabilities.\\n\\nThe product provides a user-friendly experience\\nwhile leveraging the AI model's intelligence\\nto make decisions or predictions.\\nHowever, the security of the model is crucial\\nto maintaining the product's integrity.\\nIf the model is compromised through adversarial attacks,\\ndata poisoning, or reverse engineering,\\nit could lead to incorrect predictions or biased outputs,\\nundermining the functionality and trustworthiness\\nof the AI product.\\nAn AI system is the complete solution\\nthat includes both the model and the product.\\n\\nIt's a combination of all the components\\nthat work together to provide the end results\\nto help solve specific problems or delivering certain tasks.\\nSecuring the entire AI system\\nensures that both the model and the product,\\nas well as their entire ecosystem,\\nworks securely together to deliver reliable outcomes.\\nNow let's talk about how AI differs\\nfrom traditional software in key areas.\\n\\nTraditional software follows predefined rules\\nand performs tasks in a fixed and predictable manner.\\nAI systems, on the other hand,\\nlearn from the data and adapt over time,\\nmaking their behavior dynamic and less predictable.\\nIn traditional software, data follows specific instructions\\nto produce a predefined output,\\nsuch as calculating the wages in a payroll system.\\nIn AI, on the other hand,\\ndata drives learning and decision-making.\\n\\nFor decision-making, traditional software is deterministic.\\nIt follows fixed and preset rules or logic applied to it.\\nOn the other hand, AI is probabilistic,\\nmaking predictions based on patterns in data,\\nwhich introduces complexity and potential risks.\\nThe traditional software requires manual updates\\nto fix errors.\\nFor example, if a payroll system\\ncalculates taxes incorrectly\\ndue to a recent change in tax law,\\na developer must update the software code\\nto correct the issue.\\n\\nOn the other hand, AI systems adapt\\nto new data automatically.\\nBut this can introduce subtle errors or biases,\\nlike misclassifying employee categories,\\nwhich are harder to detect and fix later.\\nTraditional software is easier to audit.\\nAI models, especially complex ones,\\nare often like black box systems,\\nmaking it harder to understand\\nhow the decisions are made in that black box,\\nwhich poses security and compliance challenges.\\n\\nIn traditional software,\\nthe code is embedded in the application itself,\\nwhile in AI systems, the model's code resides on servers\\nor cloud platforms trained on large datasets.\\nThe AI product integrates this model\\nto interact with users or other systems.\\nWith these differences in mind,\\nAI security presents unique challenges\\ndue to its reliance on data, continuous learning,\\nand models evolving over time.\\n\\nAI systems depend on data to learn,\\nand if this data is manipulated,\\nsuch as through data poisoning attacks or other attacks,\\nit can result in harmful outcomes\\nlike fraudulent transactions or biased decisions being made.\\nProtecting data integrity is essential for AI security.\\nUnlike traditional software,\\nAI models face unique security risks.\\nFor example, there are adversarial attacks\\nwhich might subtly manipulate data\\nto trick the model into making incorrect decisions.\\n\\nAdditionally, model theft is another attack\\nwhich poses a risk,\\nwhere attackers may reverse engineer the AI model\\nto steal intellectual property\\nor compromise its performance,\\nmaking model security a critical concern.\\nUnlike traditional software, AI products evolve over time\\nas the models they use learn from new datasets.\\nThis requires continuous monitoring\\nand updates to the underlying models,\\nensuring that the product remains secure and adaptive\\nto emerging threats.\\n\\nThus, an ongoing security approach is essential\\nrather than a one-time fix.\\nAs AI becomes integral to business operations,\\nleaders must address its unique security challenges.\\nAI systems must be secure at launch and as they evolve,\\nrequiring robust security throughout the entire lifecycle,\\nfrom data and model protection\\nto safeguarding AI products in use.\\n\\nIn the next video,\\nwe will explore common vulnerabilities and strategies\\nto proactively address these risks.\\nLet's get

lead to security breaches,\\nsuch as unauthorized access to secure areas or systems,\\nundermining trust in the technology.\\nFinally, let's talk about model extraction.\\nThis happens when cyber

[Instructor] As we covered in the previous video,\\nthere are three key ways attackers can target AI models.\\nIn this video, we will dive into the first method,\\nattacks on AI algorithms.\\nThese foundational algorithms are critical\\nto the functioning of AI models,\\nas they define how AI processes data, learns,\\nand generates outputs.\\nWhen these algorithms are compromised,\\nattackers can then exploit the system\\nto make incorrect or harmful decisions.\\n\\nWe will focus on three primary types of attacks\\nin this category,\\ndata poisoning, evasion attacks, and model theft,\\neach with significant real-world implications\\nthat can disrupt business operations,\\nlead to financial losses,\\nand damage your organization's reputation or brand.\\nLet's firstly talk about data poisoning attacks.\\nThese attacks occur during the training phase\\nof an AI model,\\nwhere attackers manipulate the training data\\nto corrupt the model's learning process.\\n\\nSince AI models rely on massive datasets to learn patterns,\\npoisoning this data can cause the model\\nto learn flawed or malicious behaviors,\\nleading to inaccurate, biased, or harmful outcomes.\\nFor example, imagine a fraud detection model\\ndesigned to flag fraudulent transactions.\\nNow, if an attacker got access to this model,\\nthey may insert fake data\\nand label fraudulent transactions as legitimate.\\nWhen the model learns these false patterns\\nas legitimate ones,\\nit becomes less effective at identifying real threats\\nand leaving your system vulnerable to fraudulent activities.\\n\\nReal-world incidents highlight the dangers\\nof data poisoning.\\nMicrosoft's AI chat bot, Tay, launched in 2016,\\nbecame a victim of such an attack\\nwhen it learned harmful, racist content from Twitter users,\\nwhich it started to mimic.\\nThis revealed the risks\\nof unmonitored data pipelines in AI systems.\\nAnother example is search engine algorithms being poisoned\\nto spread false information\\nsuch as the misleading, \\\"Does Australia exist?\\\" query\\nwhere malicious actors manipulate data\\nto generate misleading results,\\nundermining the trust in AI systems.\\n\\nNext one is evasion attack,\\nwhich happens after the AI model has been deployed.\\nIn these attacks,\\nadversaries subtly manipulate inputs\\nto trick the AI into making incorrect predictions.\\nFor instance, in a fraud detection system,\\nan attacker might alter their spending behavior\\njust enough to avoid triggering fraud alerts.\\nSmall adjustments like breaking a large purchase\\ninto smaller ones\\ncan make a fraudulent transaction appear legitimate.\\n\\nA real-world example is seen in autonomous driving systems.\\nResearchers have demonstrated\\nhow small stickers placed on the stop sign\\ncould cause a self-driving car's AI\\nto misinterpret it as a speed limit sign.\\nSuch subtle alterations,\\nwhich are invisible to the human eye,\\nare enough to confuse the AI,\\npotentially leading to a catastrophic accident\\nif the car failed to stop.\\nEvasion attacks also target facial recognition systems\\nwhere attackers can slightly alter facial features\\nto bypass security.\\n\\nIn business, similar tactics can be used\\nto evade fraud detection systems,\\nwhich allows attackers to steal sensitive information\\nor commit financial crimes or fraud,\\nleading to financial losses and damaged customer trust.\\nThe next attack, model theft,\\noccurs when attackers steal or replicate an AI model\\nby repeatedly querying it\\nto infer its structure, parameters, or training data.\\n\\nThis allows them\\nto replicate the model's functionality,\\neffectively stealing its intellectual property.\\nReverse engineering the model\\ncan lead to the extraction of its weights,\\nwhich are the parameters the model uses\\nto make predictions.\\nFor example, in 2019,\\nresearchers demonstrated how a commercial AI model\\ncould be cloned with 90% accuracy\\nsimply by querying it repeatedly.\\n\\nBy analyzing responses to various inputs,\\nthe attackers deduced\\nthe model's underlying weights and structure,\\nallowing them to replicate its behavior.\\nThis theft of model weights undermines the business value\\nof proprietary models,\\nas adversaries can misuse or sell the replicated models.\\nFor instance, in the Proofpoint evasion attack in 2019,\\nattackers used machine learning techniques\\nto bypass AI-based phishing detection systems.\\n\\nThey slightly altered phishing emails to evade detection,\\nexploiting weaknesses in the model's filtering process.\\nWhile this was more of an evasion attack than a theft,\\nit gave attackers insights\\ninto the model's internal workings\\nand potentially its weights,\\nmaking future bypasses easier.\\nIn another example, in 2023,\\nthe Alpaca and OpenLLaMA attack\\nshowed how adversaries can replicate AI models\\nthrough repeated querying.\\n\\nAttackers queried Meta's LLaMA model\\nand analyzed its responses\\nto reverse engineer its functionality.\\nThis allowed them to deduce not only the model structure,\\nbut also its internal weights,\\nleading to the creation of a similar model, Alpaca,\\nthat mimicked LLaMA's performance\\nwithout direct access to its code or data.\\nThese examples of data poisoning, evasion,\\nand model theft\\ndemonstrates significant threats to AI systems,\\nwhich compromises their integrity and reliability.\\n\\nSuch attacks expose businesses to operational disruptions,\\nfinancial losses, and reputational harm.\\nTo protect proprietary AI models,\\nrobust security measures,\\nlike training models for resilience,\\nimplementing access controls,\\nand conducting continuous monitoring, are essential.\\nIn the next session,\\nwe will explore attacks on filters in generative AI,\\nwhere attackers bypass safeguards to misuse AI capabilities.\\n\\nStay tuned.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3985314\",\"duration\":268,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Attacks on

filters,\\nwhich target the safeguards designed to restrict\\nthe inappropriate or harmful use of AI systems.\\nThese filters are critical for ensuring\\nthat AI-generated content is safe, ethical,\\nand aligned with organizational standards.\\n\\nAI models such as those used for text, image,\\nor code generation typically include filters\\nto prevent harmful or misleading outputs.\\nHowever, attackers may attempt to bypass these filters\\nto generate unintended or harmful content.\\nThese attacks pose significant risk\\nto both your organization's reputation and trustworthiness,\\nas well as potential legal consequences.\\n\\nLet's look at a few types of attacks on these filters\\nand how they can impact your business.\\nThe first attack in this category\\nis a prompt injection attack, which occurs when an attacker\\nmanipulates the inputs to a generative AI model,\\nmaking it produce harmful or unintended outputs.\\nThis can be done by embedding malicious instructions\\nwithin a seemingly harmless request.\\nFor instance, an attacker might inject hidden prompts\\ninto a chatbot or text generator to trick it\\ninto producing offensive or inappropriate content.\\n\\nFor example, in 2021, an attacker successfully bypassed\\na chatbot's safeguards and manipulated it\\nto produce harmful responses.\\nThis incident caused reputational damage\\nfor the company deploying the system, which highlighted\\nthe vulnerability of AI-driven customer-facing platforms.\\nThe potential consequences for businesses\\ninclude loss of user trust,\\nbrand damage, and customer churn.\\n\\nAnother dangerous form of attack in this category\\nis code injection, where malicious code is embedded\\ninto inputs that the AI model then executes.\\nThis allows attackers to control or disrupt\\nthe AI system's operations.\\nA prime example of this occurred in MathGPT,\\nwhich is an AI model designed\\nto solve complex maths equations.\\nAttackers exploited a vulnerability by embedding\\nmalicious code within a mathematical expression.\\n\\nWhen the AI model processed the input,\\nit not only solved the equation,\\nbut also executed hidden code, allowing attackers\\nto gain unauthorized access to the system.\\nSimilarly, the LangChain LLMMathChain attack in 2023\\ndemonstrated how attackers could inject malicious code\\ninto mathematical queries, which allowed them to manipulate\\nthe system and access sensitive data.\\n\\nThese types of attacks can compromise data,\\ndisrupt operations, and lead to severe financial losses.\\nAttacks on generative AI filters through prompt injection\\nor code injection reveals vulnerabilities\\nin the safeguards that protect AI-driven systems.\\nAs AI becomes increasingly integrated into industries,\\nattackers will continue to exploit\\nthese weaknesses or vulnerabilities.\\nBusinesses must invest in stronger defenses,\\nincluding robust filtering systems, input validation,\\nand secure model design.\\n\\nFailure to do so could result in damaged reputations,\\nfinancial penalties, and regulatory compliance issues.\\nIn the next video, we will explore\\nsupporting AI artifacts in supply chain attacks,\\nwhere attackers target the critical components\\nof your AI systems, consisting data, models,\\nand infrastructure during their development,\\ndeployment, or

emerging threat\\nto AI product security,\\nsubverting AI artifacts in supply chain attacks.\\nBut before we explore this specific threat,\\nlet's firstly break down the structure of AI supply chain.\\nTypically, it starts with the data collection,\\nwhere raw data is gathered for training AI models.\\n\\nData poisoning is a key risk here,\\nwhere attackers can subtly manipulate the data\\nfed to the system,\\nmaking the AI model biased or unreliable,\\nwhich can lead to faulty predictions or decisions.\\nNext is the model sourcing stage,\\nwhere AI models are either developed in-house\\nor obtained from third-party providers\\nor open-source platforms.\\nWhen models are developed internally,\\nteams have more control,\\nbut still face risk related to security\\nof the entire development process.\\n\\nHijacked models and backdoor models\\nare significant threats here.\\nAttackers could inject malicious code into the models\\nduring the development,\\nmaking them act maliciously once deployed.\\nEven if the model looks fine at first glance,\\nit could be secretly compromised,\\ncreating hidden vulnerabilities\\nthat only manifest in specific conditions.\\nOnce sourced, these models are integrated into the workflow\\nthrough machine learning operations, or MLOps,\\nautomating tasks like model training,\\ndeployment, and monitoring.\\n\\nThis is where software vulnerabilities can come into play.\\nAttackers could exploit weak spots in the tools\\nor libraries used in this phase\\nto gain access to the system.\\nMoreover, during the training or integration phases,\\nattackers could manipulate predictions\\nthrough prediction tampering,\\ncausing the model to output misleading or harmful results.\\nFinally, the AI models are built\\nand deployed in the production environment.\\n\\nThis is where attackers can exploit compromised packages.\\nIf the AI system relies on third-party packages or libraries\\nthat have been tampered with,\\nthey could inject malware that leads to data exfiltration\\nor system shutdowns.\\nAdditionally, build environment compromise can happen,\\nwhere attackers gain access to the environment\\nwhere models are being built,\\nfurther compromising the integrity of the system.\\n\\nNow, let's talk about\\nhow attackers might target this supply chain\\nat different stages to compromise AI products.\\nEach stage of this process is vulnerable\\nto various types of attacks,\\nand understanding these risks is crucial\\nfor securing AI products.\\nThese risks can lead to system disruptions, data breaches,\\nand the compromise of intellectual property,\\nwhich can directly impact your business operations\\nand financial performance.\\n\\nLet's look at some of the key methods\\nused in AI supply chain attacks.\\nThe first one is code execution,\\nwhere the attackers can inject malicious code\\ninto an AI system\\nthrough third-party dependencies, libraries,\\nor during model training.\\nOnce executed, this malicious code\\nwill compromise the AI system,\\nenabling attackers to take control, steal data,\\nor disrupt operations.\\nSecond type of attack in this category\\nis malware delivery to AI systems\\nusing third-party software or libraries.\\n\\nAttackers can embed malware\\ninto widely used AI packages,\\nwhich are then incorporated when the AI system is deployed.\\nThis could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized access,\\nor system shutdowns.\\nThen the third is lateral movement,\\nin which once attackers infiltrate an AI system,\\nthey can spread through the network,\\ncompromising additional systems or services.\\nThis allows them to target sensitive AI components\\nsuch as proprietary models, datasets, or infrastructure,\\nleading to data breaches or altered models.\\n\\nSo why does this matter for AI product security?\\nThese threats are not just theoretical,\\nthey have real-world implications.\\nThey target the very foundation of AI systems,\\nincluding the data, models,\\nand the tools used to deploy them.\\nBy subverting the AI supply chain,\\nattackers can compromise the integrity and reliability\\nof AI

threats\\nto help ensure your AI systems stay secure,\\neffective, and aligned with your business goals.\\nImagine your AI system\\nas a vigilant fraud detection officer,\\nwhich constantly is on the lookout\\nfor suspicious transactions,\\nbut without robust defenses,\\neven the most advanced systems can be manipulated,\\nallowing attackers to exploit vulnerabilities,\\nbypass detection methods,\\nand undermine your system's effectiveness.\\n\\nProtecting your AI isn't just an IT issue.\\nIt's about safeguarding the very foundation\\nof your organization's success.\\nA compromised system can disrupt operations,\\nharm customer trust, and create opportunities for attackers.\\nThat's why a comprehensive multi-phase approach\\nto AI security is essential.\\nImplementation of security defenses\\nbegin at the design stage.\\n\\nThe first step at this stage is to make sure that you work\\nwith trusted and high quality data sources.\\nVerifying data accuracy\\nand integrity is crucial to avoid hidden biases\\nor malicious inputs.\\nTo protect your data throughout its lifecycle,\\nimplement data hashing techniques.\\nHashing is a process\\nwhere a hash function generates a fixed length unique\\ndigital footprint for any data set.\\n\\nThis fingerprint called the hash value represents\\nthe original data in a compact form.\\nEven the smallest change in the data\\nwill result in a completely different hash.\\nBy comparing the hash value\\nof your data at different stages,\\nsuch as before and after transmission or storage,\\nyou can easily detect if the data has been\\ntempered with or altered.\\nThis technique is widely used to ensure data integrity\\nand it protects against unauthorized changes,\\nas well as safeguards sensitive information,\\nensuring that what you receive or store,\\nis exactly what was intended.\\n\\nDuring this phase, also evaluate your model's robustness\\nby exposing it to adversarial training.\\nFor instance,\\nsimulate attacks like splitting a fraudulent transaction\\ninto smaller amounts.\\nBy training on these scenarios,\\nyour AI learns to resist manipulative tactics effectively.\\nBefore you deploy your system in production,\\nrigorous checks are critical.\\nStart with model integrity checks to verify\\nthat your trained model haven't been tampered\\nwith in the pre-deployment phase.\\n\\nNext, you should conduct security scans\\nto identify vulnerabilities or malicious code.\\nThere are third party tools\\nlike hidden layers model scanner,\\nwhich may help you in detecting threats\\nbefore they reach production.\\nFinally, incorporate cryptographic signing\\ninto your workflow.\\nThis process certifies your models\\nand data sets\\nto help ensure only verified versions are used\\nand that any unauthorized changes are flagged immediately.\\n\\nOnce your AI system is live in production,\\nsecurity doesn't end there,\\nas the AI model evolves over time\\nand so do the security risks.\\nYour team must implement real time monitoring\\nto track inputs\\nand outputs for anomalies,\\nmuch like a security camera for your AI.\\nRegular security evaluations are equally important.\\nTechniques like red teaming\\nand penetration testing simulate real world attacks,\\nhelping uncover weaknesses and fortify your defenses,\\nand of course, make sure\\nthat your teams maintain good security hygiene\\nby applying patches promptly, auditing system logs,\\nand reviewing configurations to stay ahead\\nof the potential threats.\\n\\nAdversarial attacks have grown more sophisticated,\\ntargeting everything from training data\\nto supply chain components.\\nIn AI models, attacks like data poisoning, evasion,\\nand model theft,\\nexploit weak points in the model.\\nWhile in generative AI,\\nprompt injections can lead to harmful outputs.\\nTo counter these threats,\\nthere are several advanced tools in the market,\\nlike HiddenLayer and SPLXAI,\\nwhich offer comprehensive solutions.\\n\\nHidden layers AI detection and response,\\nmonitor systems in real time\\nto mitigate risks like model tampering or data poisoning.\\nSPLXAI compliments these efforts\\nby simulating complex multimodal attacks\\nacross text, images and voice inputs,\\nensuring your systems remain resilient\\nagainst emerging threats.\\nI do want to call out that please don't forget\\nto do your own research\\nand due diligence to determine which tool may be a best fit\\nfor your organizational needs.\\n\\nNow, let's bring it all together.\\nDefending against adversarial attacks require a strategic\\ncombination of efforts across the design, deployment,\\nand maintenance phases of AI systems.\\nBy integrating techniques like adversarial training,\\ndata hashing, cryptographic signing, continuous monitoring,\\nand advanced threat detection,\\nbusinesses can create a secure and resilient AI ecosystem\\nthat not only protects operations,\\nbut also

implement\\nfor your AI model is watermarking\\nfor intellectual property protection\\nembedding a digital watermark in your AI models\\nact as a unique signature,\\nproving ownership and deterring\\nunauthorized replication or usage.\\nThis is particularly important\\nfor protecting your competitive edge in the market.\\n\\nWithout model watermarking,\\ncompetitors or malicious actors\\ncan easily steal or replicate your model,\\nundermining your business advantage,\\nand intellectual property.\\nYou can also expose your models\\nto adversarial training through simulated\\nadversarial inputs during development\\nand training phases.\\nIt helps prepare them for real-world challenges.\\nThis training ensures that they can detect\\nand reject manipulative inputs,\\nenhancing their resilience to adversarial attacks.\\n\\nBy incorporating adversarial training,\\nyou increase your model's robustness,\\nreducing the risk of revenue loss\\ndue to fraudulent transactions\\nor security breaches.\\nThen just as with data security,\\nAI models also require ongoing monitoring\\nand regular audits, so continuous monitoring\\nand auditing is highly important\\nto secure your AI models.\\nReal-time monitoring tools act like security cameras,\\nwhich help detect unusual activity or emerging threats.\\n\\nPeriodic audits ensure vulnerabilities are identified\\nand addressed proactively,\\nkeeping your model secure over time.\\nContinuous monitoring helps prevent\\nunexpected system failures\\nthat could cause business disruption\\nor data breaches.\\nAs discussed earlier in the course,\\ntransparency and explainability\\nin AI models play a critical role\\nin security to maintain customer trust.\\n\\nBy understanding how decisions are made,\\norganizations can detect anomalies\\nor manipulations more effectively\\nand ensure compliance with ethical standards.\\nTo help with this, you may implement controls\\nsuch as model interpretability\\nto help make AI models understandable to humans.\\nAudit logs, which track everything\\nthat the model does from data input\\nto decisions it makes and changes it makes\\nto the model over time can also help\\nwith explainability and transparency.\\n\\nExplainable AI frameworks are another solution\\nto help non-experts, like stakeholders,\\nregulators, and customers,\\nunderstand how decisions are being made by the AI.\\nThis will help in maintaining\\nthe trust with these entities.\\nThe ability to explain how the AI\\nis making decisions is essential in industries\\nwith high regulatory scrutiny\\nsuch as healthcare, finance, and legal.\\n\\nIt is also essential to secure your entire AI supply chain.\\nPre-trained models,\\nthird-party artifacts, like data sets,\\nor external libraries,\\nwhich you may use in the AI model,\\ncan be entry points for attackers.\\nImplementing tools to track and verify\\nthe integrity of these components ensures\\nthey remain uncompromised.\\nWith AI models relying heavily on third-party data\\nand services, neglecting supply chain security\\ncould lead to compromised systems\\nand major security incidents.\\n\\nIn earlier sessions,\\nwe covered threats like adversarial attacks,\\nmodel inversion, and model theft.\\nThese risks underscore the need\\nfor a layered defense strategy,\\nwhich was

[Instructor] Welcome back.\\nAs AI continues to transform industries,\\nthe risks associated with it are evolving.\\nManaging these risks require a structured\\nand proactive approach supported by frameworks\\nthat ensure AI systems operate safely,\\nsecurely, and ethically.\\nYou can think of AI risk management like managing traffic\\nin a bustling city\\nwhere the traffic planners identify accident\\nprone zones and they adjust the signals\\nto prevent mishaps from occurring.\\n\\nSimilarly, AI teams identify system vulnerabilities,\\nassess their potential impact,\\nand implement strategies to prevent disruptions.\\nThe process begins with risk identification.\\nThis involves identifying potential threats\\nsuch as data exposure, algorithmic failures,\\nand system vulnerabilities in either a new AI system\\nyour team is building or an existing one.\\nOnce risks are identified,\\nthe next step is to assess them\\nbased on two key factors.\\n\\nThe first one is likelihood,\\nor how probable is the risk to actually occur,\\nand second is the impact\\nor how severe the consequences would be\\nif the risk materialized.\\nThis assessment then helps determine whether a risk falls\\nwithin the organization's risk appetite,\\nor the level of risk the organization is willing to accept.\\nIt is important to remember\\nthat not all risks require immediate treatment.\\n\\nFor those within the acceptable range,\\nongoing monitoring may be sufficient.\\nFor risks that exceed the acceptable range,\\nvarious treatment strategies can be applied.\\nThe first strategy is to avoid the risk altogether\\nby discontinuing the risky activity.\\nAnother option is to reduce the risk\\nby implementing measures like encryption,\\nbias detection tools, system redundancies,\\nor so many other security controls that we have talked\\nduring the course.\\n\\nOrganizations may also transfer the risk to another party,\\nsuch as through insurance or partnerships.\\nFinally, there's an option\\nto accept the risk and proceed,\\nwhich is often chosen when the cost\\nof treatment outweighs the benefits.\\nWhen leaders understand\\nand apply these principles of risk identification,\\nassessment and treatment,\\nthey help their organizations\\nto effectively navigate the complexities\\nof AI risk management\\nand ensure their systems remain safe, secure,\\nand aligned with their goals.\\n\\nNow, let's break this down further by looking at the types\\nof risks AI systems face.\\nThe first ones are security risks.\\nThese include data breaches, adversarial attacks,\\nand model inversion attacks.\\nPreventative measures like encryption\\nand multifactor authentication are essential\\nto address these threats.\\nNext are the ethical risks caused\\nby the biases in AI algorithms,\\nwhich can undermine fairness and erode trust in AI systems.\\n\\nTo mitigate these risks,\\norganizations should perform ethical audits\\nto examine the decision making processes of AI models,\\nto help identify potential sources of bias,\\nand evaluate their impact on different demographic groups.\\nAdditionally, the use\\nof diverse training data sets will help ensure\\nthat AI models are trained on data representative\\nof various populations,\\nwhich help reduce the likelihood of skewed outcomes.\\n\\nImplementing bias detection tools\\ncan further enhance fairness by identifying\\nand addressing biases during the development\\nand deployment stages,\\nwhich helps foster equitable\\nand trustworthy AI systems.\\nThen next risks are operational risks,\\nwhich are caused by system failures\\nand model drift due to factors like changing data patterns,\\noutdated algorithms or infrastructure issues,\\nwhich can disrupt AI functionality.\\n\\nTo maintain reliability,\\norganizations should conduct regular system checks\\nand implement periodic model training.\\nThese measures ensure that AI systems\\nremain accurate, functional,\\nand aligned with evolving requirements.\\nNext set of risks are the compliance risks,\\nwhich may arise when the regulatory requirements\\nlike GDPR and Europe AI Act,\\nare not met.\\nFailure to comply to these regulatory requirements can lead\\nto hefty fines and reputational damage.\\n\\nTo tackle these challenges,\\nbusinesses can adopt AI risk management frameworks\\nlike NIST AI Risk Management framework,\\nISO 42001,\\nMITRE Atlas,\\nalong with complying with Europe AI Act\\nand directives from the AI Executive Order\\nsigned by President Biden.\\nThese resources provide essential tools\\nsuch as real-time monitoring\\nto help perform continuous checks\\nfor unusual behavior or security threats,\\nwhile enabling quick response to those threats.\\n\\nRisk assessment tools which help identify weaknesses\\nin AI models early on to address vulnerabilities\\nbefore they escalate.\\nAnd last, but not the least, incident response plans\\nto help getting prepared for AI related issues\\nor incidents like data breaches or system failures.\\nEurope AI Act adopts a risk-based approach\\nby categorizing AI systems into four levels of risk,\\nunacceptable, high, limited, and minimal.\\n\\nFor high risk systems, the Act mandates\\nthat you should conduct thorough risk assessments,\\nimplement safeguards to address data quality\\nand algorithmic bias,\\nand ensuring human oversight to mitigate unethical\\nor discriminatory outcomes.\\nIt also requires post-market surveillance\\nto continuously monitor deployed systems\\nto help ensure they remain safe and compliant over time.\\nCompliance with frameworks like the Europe AI Act,\\ndoesn't just minimize risks.\\n\\nIt also offers significant benefits.\\nBy safeguarding against breaches and regulatory fines,\\nbusinesses can prevent financial losses.\\nThey can help build trust by demonstrating their commitment\\nto secure, ethical, and compliant AI systems,\\nand they can then foster innovation\\nby creating a safe environment\\nfor experimentation and growth.\\nAnother key aspect\\nof AI risk management is stakeholder communication.\\n\\nJust as traffic systems inform the public\\nabout road incidents,\\norganizations also need to keep regulators,\\ncustomers, and internal teams informed about AI performance,\\nits risks and mitigation strategies.\\nRegular updates build transparency, foster trust,\\nand keep everyone aligned with the organization's AI vision.\\nFinally, ethical governance plays a vital role\\nin ensuring AI systems operate fairly transparently\\nand accountability to mitigate ethical risks,\\nwhich we discussed earlier.\\n\\nFrameworks like AI TRiSM,\\nwhich stands for Artificial Intelligence, trust, risk\\nand Security Management,\\nand Google SAIF, which stands for systemic AI framework,\\nembed ethical principles directly into AI workflows\\nto help address bias and ensure responsible decision making\\nat

[Instructor] Welcome back to the second part\\nof our discussion on system design principles\\nfor AI product security.\\nIn this session,\\nwe are going to explore advanced principles,\\nincluding AI-specific threat modeling,\\nsecure code practices, DevSecOps,\\nand how AI-driven automation can play a pivotal role\\nin preventing threats.\\nLet's start with the AI-specific threat modeling.\\nAI systems are uniquely vulnerable\\nto risks like adversarial attacks, data poisoning,\\nand leakage of sensitive training data.\\n\\nThreat modeling helps us identify\\nand prioritize these risks,\\nallowing us to create tailored countermeasures\\nto protect against them.\\nAdversarial attacks, for example,\\ninvolve subtle manipulations of input data\\nto fool AI models into making incorrect predictions.\\nOne way to defend against this\\nis by implementing robust input validation\\nand anomaly detection mechanisms\\nto ensure that predictions remain consistent and reliable.\\n\\nSecure coding practices are the foundation\\nof any secure AI system.\\nDuring development, we must ensure\\nthat proper input validation is already done\\nto prevent malicious data from affecting model integrity.\\nThen secondly, the training pipelines are shielded\\nfrom tempering and unauthorized access.\\nThen last but not the least,\\nonly trusted libraries and frameworks are used\\nto mitigate the risks of vulnerabilities.\\n\\nAdditionally, automated tools and peer code reviews\\ncan be instrumental in identifying security flaws early on,\\nensuring a solid base for the AI system\\nbefore it reaches deployment.\\nNow, let's look at DevSecOps.\\nIt is a critical component of modern AI development.\\nDevSecOps integrates security throughout the AI lifecycle,\\nfrom model training to deployment.\\nThis approach ensures that security isn't an afterthought,\\nbut a continuous part of the process.\\n\\nAutomated tools within DevSecOps monitor for compliance,\\nanalyze code for vulnerabilities,\\nand validate models\\nagainst predefined security criteria in real time.\\nBy doing so, we minimize the risk\\nof introducing flaws into the system\\nand ensure that our models meet security standards\\nthroughout their life cycle.\\nAI-driven automation is revolutionizing security practices,\\nespecially when it comes to monitoring model drift\\nand maintaining performance over time.\\n\\nAs AI models evolve and learn from new data,\\nthey can introduce vulnerabilities or performance issues.\\nThis is where AI-driven security automation\\nplays a critical role.\\nBy automating the monitoring of the model performance\\nand detecting model drift,\\nsecurity teams can quickly flag unauthorized behaviors,\\nretrain models as needed,\\nand ensure that the system remains secure\\nand efficient and effective.\\n\\nBut there's an even more advanced approach we can leverage,\\nAI-driven red teaming.\\nAutomated red teaming allows us\\nto proactively test AI systems\\nby simulating attacks\\nand identifying potential vulnerabilities in real time.\\nAs I had mentioned previously in the course,\\nthat there are many tools out there,\\nfor example, HiddenLayer and Splx,\\nwhich are valuable in this area as well.\\nThese tools can continuously simulate and assess threats,\\nproviding insights into potential vulnerabilities\\nthat can be patched before they are exploited.\\n\\nBy incorporating these advanced techniques,\\nAI-specific threat modeling, secure code practices,\\nDevSecOps, and AI-driven security automation,\\nwe can ensure that AI systems\\nare not only secure, but resilient.\\nThese strategies allow AI systems\\nto adapt to new threats\\nwhile maintaining peak performance and compliance.\\nAI-driven red teaming\\nwill significantly bolster our defenses,\\nproviding real-time simulations\\nand proactive threat detection,\\nultimately preventing attacks before they even happen.\\n\\nThis makes AI-driven automation an essential tool\\nfor security teams,\\nhelping them stay ahead of the evolving threats\\nand ensure that AI systems operate safely and ethically\\nin production environments.\\nSecure system designed for AI\\nis not just about protecting data,\\nit's about creating an ecosystem\\nwhere AI functions safely, reliably, and ethically\\nin real-world applications.\\nThanks for watching.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"4.
