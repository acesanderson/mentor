Here you are, ready to learn about zero trust.\\nWell, the question is, why care?\\nWhat brought you here?\\nWere you told by some leader,\\n\\\"You need to take this training,\\n\\\"you need to better understand this.\\\"\\nMaybe you've been hearing this term\\nas you've gone to conferences,\\nhave been around security topics\\nand said, \\\"You know, I need to beef up on this.\\\"\\nWell, my goal here is to explain\\nand actually show you really why you need\\nto understand this topic,\\nbasically show the deficiencies of traditional security\\nand why everything is moving towards a zero trust model.\\n\\nSo let's start with understanding traditional security.\\nTraditional security starts with a firewall\\nand then some basic segmentation.\\nBasically, a inside network, a outside network,\\nand probably some form of DMZ.\\nTraditional security probably has your resources\\nin a data center, and maybe you have a repeat\\nof the firewall, and then from there, you got users.\\nAnd these users will be inside the network and feel nice\\nand protected behind this firewall as they go to\\nand from the internet.\\n\\nHowever, to protect the endpoint, maybe you have like AV.\\nThis is the most basic security\\nand what's happened with traditional security is,\\ncybersecurity attack and defend concepts happened,\\nthings got more advanced,\\nand basically more capabilities were needed.\\nSo the defenders and makers\\nof technology would invent new capabilities,\\nand then the people buying those would buy these\\nas more or less features or appliances.\\nSo maybe you buy a next-gen firewall,\\nso we'll call this next-gen firewall\\nthat has more capabilities built in,\\nand/or you buy other things like your IPS,\\nyour breach detection,\\nor whatever widget you want to put in there,\\nbut you stack the technology there\\nand then what you do is you force traffic through that,\\ntypically in a network with some form of routing.\\n\\nThen what happens?\\nWe call it north-south traffic.\\nWhen our user wants to go to the internet\\nor download things,\\nthe routing forces it through the security stack.\\nIf they want to go internally\\nto different parts of the network,\\nthe traffic is routed through security\\nand then to wherever they want to go,\\nand then if needed, you would build another stack\\nand route traffic through that before you get\\nto like your data center.\\nThis fundamentally works, but then there are also challenges\\nas things have changed.\\nFirst off, people started working from home,\\nand as a band-aid, the idea of VPN\\nor virtual private networks were more and more utilized\\nto basically force traffic back to the network,\\nso you add a VPN concentrator,\\nyou force traffic through security,\\nand then once passing security, either then,\\ngo out to the internet or bounce back\\ninto the inside network with an inside IP address.\\n\\nThat works until you think about scalability,\\nas well as thinking about the complexity\\nas you add more security features.\\n'Cause if you think about this, these technologies,\\nso let's say that I have my packets going through,\\nfirst, an encrypted tunnel\\nand then having to take pit stops\\nfor every capability is going to have a performance hit.\\nEspecially when you start looking at things like encryption,\\nwhere we talk about HTTPS,\\nand then basically, you need what's called SSL decryption,\\nso every single packet has to be decrypted,\\nanalyzed by security, and then reencrypted.\\n\\nAll this has performance challenges,\\nwhich creates basically a need to do something new\\nor address these challenges.\\nOther challenges with this architecture is,\\nwhat is a data center?\\nI mean, think about this.\\nThis may be the data center here,\\nbut as we start thinking about cloud,\\nmaybe you think about Amazon, maybe you use Google,\\nmaybe you use Microsoft, whatever it may be,\\nthat app could be here, that app could be here,\\nthat app could be here, and if a user is off network,\\nthey could just go directly here, bypassing security.\\n\\nNow, one approach may be, well,\\nlet's build our own security stack here,\\nbut the technology's kind of different there\\nif you think about it.\\nLike a firewall appliance here would mean that the vendor,\\nlet's say it's Palo Alto or Fortinet\\nor whoever, you would need\\nto then buy a virtual version of that.\\nSo we'll highlight that, for example,\\nwith green saying this is my next-gen firewall\\nfor the cloud, this is my next-gen firewall for on-prem,\\nbut now we have two separate tools to have to manage.\\nSo now I'm thinking about, oh great, now I have to go\\nand buy this like super manager\\nthat basically is unifying the policies here\\nand policies here.\\n\\nSo basically, we're taking old tactics\\nand just band-aiding fixes as we address new challenges.\\nAnd all of this has led to a handful of challenges\\nthat justify why you need to be thinking\\nabout modern security, i.e. zero trust.\\nIn my experience, these are the main drivers\\nthat are challenges from this\\nthat are causing new organizations\\nto think about this topic.\\nNumber one, for sure, security is all about data protection.\\n\\nAnd if you think about data loss, data lifecycle management,\\nthis kind of topic, in this environment,\\nit is extremely challenged to enforce data security.\\nWe'll use blue as representing data.\\nIf data is on this laptop here\\nand you can force it in line or data in motion,\\nyeah, maybe you can look for things throughout the stack.\\nSo you can do like Social Security checks,\\nother like data in motion concepts.\\nHowever,\\nwhat if that data is going through an encrypted tunnel\\nand there's no SSL or something,\\nor what if the person leaves the organization, goes home,\\nand has the data on their laptop here,\\nand then goes to what we call SaaS,\\nwhich is basically something like Dropbox\\nand puts the data there?\\nWe call this shadow IT,\\nmeaning the IT staff no longer has visibility\\nto where that data is at.\\n\\nAnd there are some data arrests,\\nlike you can take a PDF and encrypt it,\\nbut it just gets cumbersome to scale something like that.\\nAlso, data changes.\\nSo you have data in the data center,\\nand we're talking a lot of data\\nthat could exist in all formats, and change.\\nHow do you understand all the formats of this data\\nand apply policy?\\nAnd then what happens when you sync with other clouds\\nand the data's being replicated there?\\nIt just, data becomes an extreme challenge.\\nSo with modern security,\\nwe're talking about collapsing all this\\nto be able to then apply unified policies\\nto address things like concerns with data.\\n\\nNumber two, an important challenge that is addressed\\nby looking at modern security\\nor zero trust concepts is performance.\\nAnd this is an important one\\nbecause this challenge here, this idea of stacking security\\nand creating basically bottlenecks leads to,\\nwhat I find in organizations, exceptions.\\nSo when COVID-19 happened,\\nand this worked, i.e. working from home,\\nfor 100 people, but when they sent 10,000 people home\\nand then forced them all through a VPN,\\nit created a massive bottleneck from many organizations\\nand the only thing they could do\\nis basically do limited security, selective security.\\n\\nSo they can say, \\\"All right, when something is trying to go\\n\\\"to the data center, we will force that traffic,\\n\\\"but everything else, let it go on its own will.\\\"\\nSo we have no visibility in like 80% of the traffic\\nbecause with 10,000 people,\\nwe can only look at a small subset\\nof the 10,000 user traffic.\\nAlso, if you think about like,\\nthe idea of going through this\\nand then trying to route traffic somewhere,\\nso we talk like optimization, these kind of concepts,\\nit's just almost impossible in this model.\\n\\nSo the idea\\nof zero trust modern security is not just being more secure\\nbut doing it in a way that is work-friendly,\\none that takes into consideration the user experience,\\nand that's typically another big driver towards zero trust.\\nA third driver is basically keeping it simple.\\nThis is not simple.\\nThis is complex.\\nAnd if there are ways to reduce the amount of vendors,\\nreduce the complexity, have one place, get rid of this idea\\nof super manager where you have\\nto have one system managing different types of technologies\\nto unify policy\\nand just have one security stack anywhere in the world,\\nit makes it simple.\\n\\nIt actually not only makes it simple,\\nit's going to save you time, and people cost money.\\nSo essentially, by simplifying things,\\nyou're getting a less expensive, more secure platform.\\nFour, a driver would be to be modern.\\nAnd what being a modern is,\\npeople want to have the latest technologies\\nand want to have something that is simple\\nand has performance yet still protects the data.\\nOne example will be, you can do multi-factor authentication,\\nwhich is something you have, know, or are,\\nbut like passwords are a pain in the butt\\nfor a lot of people,\\nbecause to either to make a password work,\\nyou got to have this dramatically long, complex password,\\nand just to be more modern, why have that?\\nSo for example, a common desire is going passwordless.\\n\\nSo I can just look at something using facial recognition\\n(snaps) and I get access to what I need.\\nBut to accommodate modern,\\nyou can't do that in a broken environment.\\nFor example, if the active directory system sits somewhere\\nin the data center and you've got this user somewhere\\nin Starbucks and they look at their phone,\\nwith this complexity, there's no way\\nwithin a timely manner\\nthat that login can make its way all the way here\\nand then validate or not validate that person\\nand then basically say yes or no.\\n\\nSo another big driver is being able\\nto support modern capabilities\\nand just basically make a better work environment.\\nAnother desire, another driver to get away from this\\nand learn about zero trust is the ability to scale.\\nIf you think about this, if I was to open a new office\\nor if I want to have high availability\\nin these other concepts, I need to build more stacks,\\nand I'm basically creating more complexity.\\nThink about like this architecture here.\\nRight now, have to duplicate this for the new data center\\nor the backup data center, duplicate this as well,\\ncreate failover, and then if we think\\nabout these cloud environments,\\nif I'm going to be scaling there as well,\\nI'm just going to have to keep going back to, for example,\\nthe next-gen firewall vendor and buy more firewalls\\nand then if I add more capabilities,\\nthere's a point where they're going to say, \\\"You know what?\\n\\\"This firewall isn't fast enough.\\n\\n\\\"You have 10,000 users, not 100 users.\\n\\\"You need to upgrade this, you need to replace this.\\\"\\nSo maybe the first version costs $200,000,\\nnow you need the million dollar box.\\nIt just doesn't make sense.\\nSo rather than trying to use the old approach,\\nmodern security is elastic.\\nIt's using cloud.\\nIt can scale based on what you need.\\nSo think about another pandemic, God forbid,\\nand we send everybody home, you have the ability\\nto scale up when needed and then when they all go back\\nto the office, you can scale it back down\\nand it's cost effective.\\n\\nLastly, and most importantly, better security.\\nNow, you're going to learn in this course\\nabout the attack-defend concepts, which means understanding\\nthat the attackers\\nare going to constantly change their techniques, tactics,\\nand procedures, meaning the defenders are also having\\nto adjust.\\nAnd some of these tactics are not going to be able\\nto be defended against properly in an environment like this.\\nThe idea is, for example, big data or AI.\\n\\nIf you're going to take advantage of a lot of data\\nand you have traditional appliances within your network,\\nthink about it.\\nHow are you going to get that intelligence into those devices?\\nIf we're talking like big data, which is a ton of data,\\nyou have to get that into the system\\nand have the system process it.\\nAlso, let's say that you need help\\nand you pull in some cyber expert.\\nThat person needs to have a way to log in here\\nand be able to do their work.\\nThese are just some examples of limitations\\nof this approach, where if we're looking at modern,\\nbetter security, for example, technology in the cloud\\nthat the vendor has access to when needed,\\nor is in the cloud and it has the ability\\nto consume big data, it can leverage\\nand integrate with other technologies,\\npotentially leverage AI,\\nwe're talking about better security.\\n\\nSo as the attackers come up with new sophisticated attacks,\\nthat your defense could also be just as sophisticated\\nand be able to reduce the risk of the breach.\\nSo hopefully this makes sense.\\nHopefully now you can see, there's an actual real reason\\nand driver that you need to understand zero trust.\\nThis model is going away, if not already dead and gone.\\nYou need to understand how to take something like this,\\nbecause most organizations unfortunately are somewhere\\nin this design, and you need to figure out a way\\nto basically become more modern,\\nto think about principles like zero trust\\nand meet goals such as these.\\n\\nHopefully this course will help you accomplish that goal.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2022573\",\"duration\":664,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"The cat and mouse

Our first concept is the cat and mouse game,\\nwhich essentially represents\\nthe attack and defend landscape.\\nIf you think about the attacker, the cat in this case,\\ntheir goal is to accomplish whatever it may be,\\nand they're going to use any tactic that makes sense\\nto accomplish their goal.\\nSocial engineering, hacking, whatever it may be,\\nthe attacker's going to do their attacking thing.\\nMeanwhile, on the defender side,\\nyou have the researchers,\\nyou have the organizations seeing these attacks,\\nand what they're going to do is they're going to create a defense.\\n\\nThey're going to create a response,\\nthey're going to try to learn about the attacker and adapt.\\nBut what happens?\\nWhen they do that, the cat, the attacker,\\nis going to realize they're no longer effective\\nand they're going to switch their tactic.\\nAnd it's a constant back and forth.\\nHence, there is no way to be fully secure,\\nand there is no way to truly understand\\nwhat the cat and what the mouse are doing.\\nThis is why they say cybersecurity is a cat and mouse game.\\n\\nThe attacker will attack, the defender will defend.\\nWhen one doesn't work anymore, there's a readjustment.\\nAnd one other interesting thing is people will ask, well,\\nwhat happens when you take out the attacker?\\nIs it done? Is the threat gone?\\nAnd the answer's no.\\nAll you do is you fill a void for a new cat, a new attacker,\\nto step in.\\nSo cybersecurity essentially is an ongoing\\ncat and mouse game.\\nLet me give you an example of the cat and mouse game.\\n\\nHere is like a general timeline of, let's say,\\nan attacker attacking a computer.\\nSo initially, let's think about a general computer\\nwith a general operating system,\\nand the attacker's going after that.\\nWhen they first attack, it's probably going to work,\\nprobably going to be successful.\\nBut then the makers of the operating systems,\\nthe organizations using these\\nare going to start applying security.\\nSo essentially what will happen is as\\nthat security is being applied,\\nthe success rate of the attack will go down.\\n\\nSo what happens is the attacker's going to realize\\nthis computer thing is not working as much.\\nWhat's an easier route? What's a better way of doing this?\\nAnd they're going to move to maybe the browser\\nbecause they realize every computer's going to\\nhave an internet browser.\\nSo then the attackers will start\\nlaunching attacks against that.\\nThe defenders will realize they've shifted focus\\nand start hardening the browsers.\\nSo your Microsofts, your Firefoxes,\\nwhoever makes your browser\\nwill add their security capabilities.\\nThe attackers will realize\\nwe're not being effective anymore,\\nand move on to maybe plugins,\\n'cause plugins are third party plugins not made by the OS\\nor made by the browser manufacturer.\\n\\nTherefore, now it's a new target and it just keeps going on.\\nThat will be successful for a little bit\\nuntil eventually the plugins are hardened\\nor the OS systems isolate those\\nor whoever means to reduce that risk.\\nAnd it just keeps going till eventually you get\\nto like Powershell or other means, and it's just this cat\\nand mouse game of the attacker tries something,\\nit works for a while,\\nand then when it doesn't, they move on to something else.\\nAnd the funny thing about this is,\\nit's not lateral as I'm showing here,\\nbecause the attackers could always go\\nback to the operating system with some new exploit\\nor go back to the browser.\\n\\nSo this is a simple timeline,\\nbut the reality of it is the attackers could be bouncing\\naround between all these areas while the defenders are more\\nor less chasing it, like whack-a-mole,\\ntrying to keep up with\\nwhat the attackers are doing at this point in time.\\nOne great example of this idea of the cat and mouse game\\nis the evolution of ransomware.\\nSo ransomware's been out for a while\\nand it's by far the biggest attack today.\\nAnd for a while now has been the biggest threat,\\nbiggest attacks that we see in the industry.\\n\\nWhat I bet a lot of you didn't know is\\nhow long ransomware has been out.\\nLike ransomware actually was around in the nineties.\\nJust most people don't know about that\\nbecause ransomware really wasn't effective at that time.\\nIt really wasn't until probably the 2012,\\n2015 timeframe when ransomware actually\\nbecame a real threat.\\nAnd the reason for that is, prior to that,\\nthe right technology for it to be effective\\nwasn't available.\\nThink about like the ransom.\\n\\nPrior to Bitcoins, how would an attacker basically get paid?\\nI mean, you can't, you know,\\n\\\"Here's my address. Mail me a check.\\\"\\nThat's not going to work.\\nThe authorities are going to show up.\\nYou needed things like Bitcoin to come out\\nto have an anomalous framework to basically charge a ransom.\\nSame for things like the way the encryption works,\\nthe way the exploitation works.\\nJust the technology wasn't effective for ransomware\\nto actually basically be a real threat until that time.\\nAnd then as you look down the timeline,\\nwhat happened is ransomware not only became effective,\\nit started shifting its focus.\\n\\nInitially, I would say in the beginning,\\nransomware was more about attacking individual users.\\nIt's like optimistic type of attack.\\nLike, I don't care who the target is, pay me my $300 USA.\\nBut as you look down the later timeframe,\\nwhat happened was ransomware attackers started thinking,\\nwell, it's more lucrative\\nto actually go after an organization.\\nSo rather than focusing on exploiting one target,\\nlet's focus on lateral movement.\\nLet's focus on actually making a lot of money\\nby hoarding a bunch of infected users\\nand then asking for one bigger ransom.\\n\\nSo because of that tactic,\\nas you move down the ransomware timeline,\\nwhat starts to happen is you start\\nto get a lot more sophisticated insider threat,\\nlateral movement, password stealing capabilities.\\nBecause it's not about the one ransom, it's about the group\\nof basically ransoms to make a much larger profit.\\nSo ransomware concept is simple,\\ninfect somebody, basically, take the data, lock the data,\\ntry to charge 'em for that.\\n\\nBut from a history perspective, it's continuously changing,\\ncontinuously adapting.\\nIf we look closer of\\nhow the ransomware attacks have happened\\nand how they shifted,\\nthe initial variance were very opportunistic in nature.\\nThey basically looked at any system,\\nany user, they didn't care if it's a receptionist,\\nthe CEO of a company,\\na retired individual, it doesn't matter.\\nThey basically would say, infect a system, charge $300 USA,\\nand basically blast it out\\nand hope you hit 2% to 5% of the targets.\\n\\nHowever, if you look at the later versions of ransomware,\\nwhat happened was the attackers realized it's actually much\\nmore lucrative to not focus on exploit and encrypt,\\nbut instead be more targeted.\\nFocus on an enterprise and try to spread\\nand affect as many users as possible\\nbefore you actually initiate the encryption.\\nAnd then from there, try to ask for a lot larger ransom\\nand say, I have x amount percent of your employees,\\npay me millions of dollars\\nand I'll give you all of this data back.\\n\\nSo it's a different strategy\\nbecause the initial strategy is more around exploitation\\nand then launch,\\nwith this later strategy is more around exploitation,\\nbut then stealth, steal passwords,\\nfigure out how to laterally move.\\nAnd then from there, once you have enough\\ncaptured individuals, then exploit,\\nand then go to basically leadership of that organization\\nand try to charge a larger ransom.\\nSo it's really different when it comes\\nto the earlier versus later versions of ransomware,\\nwhich by the way, all these attacks can constantly\\nback and forth around the these strategies.\\n\\nSo it's not like it's always going to be enterprise\\nor individual focused.\\nIt's a cat and mouse game.\\nThe attackers are bouncing around.\\nHowever, later version of ransomware,\\nthe big ones we see in the news\\nare very much the enterprise-focused,\\nlooking for the big hit\\nversus the individual ransomware based attacks.\\nIf we fast forward to the modern ransomware playbook,\\nso how very common ransomware today functions,\\nthe way it's going to work is figure out a way\\nto enter the environment,\\n'cause again, the goal is not to compromise one user\\nand exploit the one user for a ransom.\\n\\nThe goal is to spread.\\nSo you're going to have some initial attack vector,\\ncould be phishing, could be some\\nclick this link and exploit the system.\\nBut the whole idea is to basically gain a foothold.\\nThen they got to figure out a way to spread.\\nNow it could be an attack vector or an attack path,\\nwhich is a topic I'll talk about later in this course.\\nBut essentially it's do I hack other systems\\nor do I steal credentials?\\nSo more or less user identity.\\nAnd then from there, log in as that person,\\nand spread that way.\\n\\nBut more or less, there's a spreading component\\nthat needs to include stealth,\\n'cause the idea is you don't want to get caught.\\nSo you want to be able to hide\\nand spread until you have enough victims.\\nAnd then once you have enough victims,\\nthe third part of this playbook is to then execute,\\nwhich is now let the organization know that they're owned\\nand let them know how bad it is.\\nSo you can then come up with some very large ransom\\nand more or less say, pay this,\\nor you're going to lose all this data.\\nNow ransomware is just one\\nof the many threats that are out there.\\n\\nI like referencing it because it is the most common\\nand one that most people understand.\\nBut there are many other events that can happen\\nto basically lead to some negative outcome.\\nSo, you know, ransomware, phishing, malware,\\nthese are all examples.\\nAnd by the way, a lot of times there's\\nwhat we call chain exploitation,\\nmeaning a lot of the attacks that you're probably\\ngoing to experience are going to be a combination of these.\\nSo maybe a phishing attack is an initial\\nvector of the playbook.\\nAnd then from the spreading component,\\nthat can be the insider threat via malware\\nor again, an attack vector\\nwhere you're actually stealing identities.\\n\\nThat can be the aspect of the ransomware trying to go\\nthrough phase two of the playbook.\\nAnd then phase three,\\nthe actual exploit launch could be an\\napplication exploit or something.\\nSo these threats that I'm talking about are just ingredients\\nthat could be part of a playbook of a whole attack,\\n'cause again, most attacks are more or less\\na chained exploitation\\nor multiple types of attacks\\nto basically accomplish some goal.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3959592\",\"duration\":362,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"IoT

Now, I've talked a lot about threats,\\nand I talked a lot about attack and defend,\\ncat and mouse type fails.\\nHowever, there are some other concepts to think about\\nthat go beyond your traditional attack and defend.\\nMore or less, there's always going to be vulnerabilities.\\nAnd you may have heard this idea of\\nthere's no 100% secure.\\nWell, an easy way to understand this is, you know,\\nright now here, being in a kitchen,\\nthis could be your home or some other home.\\n\\nIt's very likely this kitchen idea\\nis going to have more and more technology.\\nI don't know about you all, I'm a technology enthusiast.\\nI have all sorts of stuff, my fire extinguishers,\\nI think even my refrigerator today even has an IP address\\nfor whatever reason.\\nI personally didn't hook it up,\\nbut maybe it has the ability to let me know\\nif my milk is low, whatever it may be.\\nBut with all this great power,\\nas they say in Spider-Man is great responsibility,\\nthese could become vulnerabilities.\\nAnd what's kind of interesting if you think about it is,\\nhow do I secure a refrigerator?\\nDo I put a firewall in it?\\nLike do I put EDR technologies?\\nProbably not.\\n\\nSo we add all this technology like in a general kitchen,\\nyet we're not adding the security like\\nyou would with a laptop.\\nHence, leads to the threats of IoT.\\nAnd I bring this up because it brings up a concept\\nof you're always going to have vulnerabilities,\\nwhich means the attackers always have a way\\nto get onto your network, get into your environment,\\nbasically, there's always that risk.\\nAnd this is what's led to the idea of zero trust.\\n\\nI mean, the challenge is this.\\nYou can't install a firewall,\\nyou can't install security products on these devices.\\nSo really your early option is for the manufacturer\\nto more or less secure that device.\\nIf they don't secure the device,\\nyou can only secure around it.\\nAnd monitor is really your options.\\nAnd to give you examples of what an attacker would do\\nto compromise an IoT device,\\nthey can attack any aspect of that device.\\nSo if you think about the average IoT device,\\nthose people aren't building everything from ground zero.\\n\\nA lot of times they're assembling using third party parts.\\nSo the chipboards, all of that are being purchased,\\nthey assemble it, they then write software,\\nand then sell you that product.\\nBut at any point in that supply chain,\\na compromise can happen that could lead to\\nthat device being owned.\\nAnd if it's a small IoT firm,\\nthat more or less is trying to be profitable,\\nthere's no way they can be monitoring\\nthat entire supply chain for vulnerabilities.\\nSo they can inherently bring in a vulnerability,\\nlike an example, the last one here, JTAG,\\nwhere somebody's going after the chipboards\\nthat are being used.\\n\\nThey didn't build those chipboards,\\nthey just used the wrong chipboard\\nand now there's a back door to that system.\\nSo there are many ways that an IoT device\\ncan be compromised.\\nAnd again, for you as the defender,\\nyou don't have a lot of options when it comes to\\nwhat you can apply from a security perspective\\nto defend these devices.\\nThis makes a whole interesting aspect\\nof defending brought into the concept\\nwhich has actually led to this whole concept of zero trust.\\nWhat I mean about IoT challenges is, you know,\\nagain, the concept that you as a consumer\\nprobably don't have an option to install security.\\n\\nNow there are exceptions,\\nbut like looking back at it like a kitchen\\nand the IoT devices there, there is no like ability\\nto install antivirus, firewalls, et cetera.\\nSo you just don't have that option.\\nThe other idea is that, as I mentioned, like a kitchen,\\nhaving the ability to do IoT devices,\\na lot of times people are just plugging devices in\\nor connecting devices without the thought of security.\\nSo there's a lot of rogue, a lot of devices coming up\\nthat IT and security are not aware of.\\n\\nThey just happen to appear on the network.\\nAnd when it comes to the patching, the security,\\nso the responsibility of the vendor,\\nthere's unfortunately not a lot of walls in the USA\\nor just globally that forces these companies\\nto actually secure their devices.\\nI mean, obviously, they don't want to be in the news.\\nThey want to sell their product,\\nbut if they're a small shop assembling a bunch of stuff\\nand trying to be profitable,\\nthey can't hire a security expert.\\nAnd they just can't have that focus.\\n\\nSo therefore they're just going to have to assume some risk.\\nSo due to these challenges,\\nthere's going to be vulnerable devices on your network\\nthat you really can't do much about outside of monitoring\\naround or more or less isolating.\\nWhat I'm showing here is basically some examples\\nof this legal limitation.\\nBasically, wherever country you're in,\\nwherever you're at in the world,\\nthere probably isn't a lot of law that says\\nyou have to secure IoT devices,\\nor else there will be some fine or some negative outcome.\\n\\nTypically what happens is it's more about brand.\\nSo these companies don't want to have a situation,\\nbecause then it will impact sales,\\nbut there's no actual laws forcing 'em\\nto secure these devices.\\nNow things are getting better, law is slowly catching up.\\nThere are better guidelines and publications\\nand best practices coming out\\nto help guide these organizations\\nto make more secure products.\\nBut we cannot by any means say, oh,\\nwe're going to be legally protected.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the risk of IoT devices,\\nit just doesn't exist.\\nUnfortunately, this is a prime example of a risk\\nthat will more or less always exist\\nand something that you need to be aware of.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3962524\",\"duration\":375,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Security best practice

Here's an important question that you should ask yourself\\nand I tend to ask any organization I meet with,\\nwhat is best practice?\\nWhere do you get your recommendations for cybersecurity?\\nSome of the most common ones that I see\\nand organizations use is guidelines,\\nwhether it's publications from like a NIST or an ISO.\\nAnother common one is going to vendors.\\nSo they established relationships\\nand say, \\\"Cisco, Microsoft, whoever,\\nwhat is your take?\\nYou have millions, if not billions, of dollars\\nthat you spend on research and development.\\n\\nHow do you see best practice?\\nWhat should we be doing?\\\"\\nAnother one may be compliance.\\nSo rather than going for a best practice,\\nit's more of what do I need to be doing?\\nThis could be anything from your PCI DSS to HIPAA.\\nIt's like, \\\"Hey, in order to use this data\\nor use these things, you must follow these rules.\\\"\\nAnd that is also in their mind, the best practice.\\nAlso, just being in the industry,\\nthere's very popular conferences, your RSAs, Black Hats,\\nDEF CONs, or experts come up and talk about this.\\n\\nThe question, though ,is really what's your best practice?\\nHopefully, you're not just going to Google,\\nand the first thing that pops up, you're like,\\n\\\"That's what I should be doing.\\\"\\nHopefully, you have some referenceable material.\\nOutside of guidelines,\\nI would say vendors are the most common resource\\nfor what is best practice.\\nIt's common that an organization will have a breach\\nor just need to understand a topic like Zero Trust\\nand say, \\\"Vendors, save me.\\nPlease explain this to me.\\nHelp me understand what is best practice.\\\"\\nUnfortunately, there is no security vendor\\nthat offers it all.\\n\\nIn the end, security vendors offer,\\nI'll call 'em LEGO pieces\\nor capabilities that you must understand,\\nyou must put together to create your platform,\\ncreate the security that's best\\nfor what you're trying to accomplish.\\nSo if you were to go to a conference\\nand say, \\\"Vendors, tell me about zero trust,\\\"\\ndepending on the vendor you're talking to,\\nthey're going to give you their story.\\nIf it's a firewall vendor,\\nyou're going to hear a firewall-based zero trust conversation.\\nIf it's a identity vendor,\\nyou're going to hear a identity-based conversation,\\nand some vendors are going to offer a couple\\nof the capabilities bundled together and call it a platform.\\n\\nOthers are going to be very specialized in one capability area,\\nbut in the end, it is up to you to decide,\\nwell, what is zero trust across the board?\\nAnd that means users, that means cloud,\\nthat means networks.\\nWhat is zero trust for you?\\nAnd how should you take these vendor components,\\nput it together to build the right platform for you?\\nAs I mentioned in my introduction,\\nit's all about not only providing recommendations,\\nbut it's also about having references.\\n\\nSo if you go to vendors, you go to publications,\\na lot of cases, they're going to reference a guideline.\\nI'll talk in a later lesson\\nabout the idea of what is a guideline\\nversus a policy and procedure,\\nbut essentially, what I'm talking about is policies,\\nprocedures, these type of things, are required.\\nGuidelines are more of recommendations.\\nYou don't have to do 'em unless somebody takes a guideline\\nand makes it a requirement.\\nBut outside of that idea, guidelines are not required.\\n\\nThey're just kind of recommended best practices,\\nand it is very common that organizations\\nwill go to these recommended best practices\\nand use these as their resource for best practice.\\nSome of the most common\\nand ones that we'll use in this course,\\nI'll talk about the Zero Trust publications from NIST.\\nWe'll also talk about the Open Group publications,\\nas well as I'll talk about some vendor-neutral ones as well.\\nBut these are examples of common guidelines\\nthat are out there that organizations will use.\\n\\nSo if they're looking for a topic like zero trust,\\nthey'll go to ISO, they'll go to NIST,\\nand they'll say, \\\"What is your view on this topic?\\\"\\nand basically use that publication\\nas that reference material for their best practice.\\nWhen it comes to conferences,\\nthese are examples of very popular security conferences,\\nbut there are many that are out there.\\nThis is an examples like your RSA, your Black Hats.\\nThese are very big, very expensive conferences,\\nor like a SchmooCon or a DEF CON.\\n\\nActually, DEFCON, I would say has gotten bigger,\\nbut SchmooCon is definitely a much smaller boutique,\\nor B-Sides is typically free or $30 USA\\nand held all over the place.\\nAnd again, it doesn't really matter the size.\\nThese are all just in general places\\nwhere you can find security experts\\nto more or less get recommendations,\\nget best practice for topics like Zero Trust.\\nWherever you get your best practice,\\nit really comes down to what's best for you.\\n\\nSo if you use a certain guideline\\nthat you feel like is best practice,\\nif there's certain vendors\\nor consultants that you trust for best practice,\\nwhatever it is, in the end,\\nmy recommendation is understand what is best for you\\nand make sure that you understand\\nthe intent of that reference.\\nBecause if you're going to a specific vendor,\\nthe intent is likely for them\\nto sell their products and services.\\nIf you're going to a guideline, that's not the intent.\\nIt's open.\\nHowever, there's going to be pros and cons of that.\\n\\nSome of the cons may be the time of the publication,\\nbecause a guideline, for it to be published,\\nit's going to take time.\\nIt's going to take a lot of references,\\na lot of review\\nbefore you actually see that,\\nversus going to a consultant\\nthat can be looking at something\\nthat just happened a few hours or days or weeks ago.\\nSo in the end, there is no best resource,\\nbut there's probably a best one for you.\\nJust understand what are the pros\\nand cons to each resource\\nwhen you are looking to these things for your best practice.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Lesson 1: Why Care about Security and Zero

Let's start off\\nwith the absolute fundamentals of cybersecurity.\\nI don't care what guideline exam,\\nwhat it may be that you're doing.\\nIn the end, it all boils down to protecting data.\\nAnd when you protect data,\\nthere are three primary principles that come into play:\\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability,\\ncommonly referred to as the CIA.\\nConfidentiality is making sure that data is protected,\\nmaking sure you'll have unwanted eyes.\\n\\nBasically, you don't have the threats\\nor the unwanted people having access to that data.\\nIntegrity is about making sure\\nthat data is not being manipulated.\\nIt's as if it's supposed to be intended.\\nAnd then lastly,\\navailability is the data is available when needed.\\nNow, when it comes to the CIA,\\nand it comes to the idea of attacks,\\ntypically they're impacting one or more of these principles.\\nSo if I'm going to do a denial of service attack,\\nI'm attacking the principle of availability.\\n\\nI'm not manipulating the data.\\nI'm not changing anything.\\nI'm not getting access.\\nI'm making it where it's not available.\\nHowever, if I'm doing a phishing attack,\\nif I'm exploiting,\\nthen I'm attacking the principle of confidentiality\\n'cause I'm getting access to the data and integrity,\\n'cause potentially I could also modify that data.\\nThe next fundamental principle is these capabilities\\nthat enforce defenses for protecting the CIA.\\nNow, a lot of vendors that make products\\nare going to talk about how great their products are,\\nwhich in the industry is called being the best of breed,\\nlike we are the best.\\n\\nHowever, personally,\\nas well as a lot of professionals will tell you\\nthat there is no best of breed.\\nMeaning you can have the most effective capability,\\nbut if you think back to the attack and mouse game,\\nanytime something is super effective,\\nthe attackers are going to work a way around it.\\nThere's no reason if something doesn't work\\nto keep trying to attack that,\\njust find a new vector.\\nTherefore, you can have the best of breed\\nsecurity capability protecting X,\\nbut that's not going to protect Y.\\n\\nTherefore, in the industry,\\nwe talk about defense in depth as being best practice.\\nMeaning rather than having the absolute best product\\nor best capability,\\nyou want to layer different capabilities.\\nSo if one fails\\nor if one attack vector is not being used,\\nanother one's being used,\\nthere is a capability there.\\nAnd if that one fails,\\nthere's something to basically back it up.\\nOn top of the defense in depth concept\\nis the idea of using different capabilities\\nas you layer capabilities.\\n\\nLike back in the day,\\nI recall the military and the USA had a requirement\\nfor two different vendor firewalls.\\nBut that's not real defense in depth\\nbecause they're both doing essentially the same thing.\\nThey both are basically allowing and not allowing traffic.\\nSo you can have a hundred vendor firewalls.\\nIf they all have the same ports open\\nand they're all doing the same thing\\nand you allow traffic through those ports,\\nit doesn't matter how many firewalls you have,\\nthat's one capability.\\nHowever, if you have different capabilities turn on,\\nso in a next gen firewall,\\nmaybe one capability is the firewall\\nor the gateway to allow and not allow traffic.\\n\\nBut then capability two is a IDS IPS,\\nwhich is doing something different.\\nIt's analyzing the traffic for malicious activity.\\nAnd then maybe capability three is,\\nafter you analyze that traffic,\\nmonitor how the behavior's happening inside the network,\\nright within a sub zone of that firewall\\nthat's being monitored,\\nknown as like a breach detection or insider threat tool,\\nnow we're talking about different capabilities\\nwith different layers.\\nAnd the idea is, as an attacker,\\nI have to beat these different capabilities.\\n\\nI have to act different.\\nI have to get past this firewall gateway tool\\nand also get past this IPS tool\\nand also get past this breach detection tool.\\nThat is defense in depth.\\nNow to be clear,\\nI'm not saying that you can't have more than one\\nof the same capabilities.\\nFor example, it's not like you just have one firewall\\nand that's it.\\nIt's fine to have, for example,\\na firewall on the perimeter of your data center\\nand then a firewall on the perimeter of your network\\nand then the firewall on your laptops and desktops,\\net cetera, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd they all are doing the same thing\\nbecause they essentially are different\\ndefense in depth locations.\\nWhat I am saying is you shouldn't just have that firewall.\\nSo you should have, for example,\\nthe firewall, the IDS IPS concept,\\nthe breach defense concept at every point.\\nSo on the laptops, in the cloud, et cetera,\\nand basically you're creating\\nmultiple defense in depth scenarios.\\nAlso, we'll talk about this a little later in the lesson,\\nthere's constant changes to these designs.\\n\\nSo this inside outside DMZ concept in my mind\\nand a lot of excerpts minds is going away anyways.\\nBut the point here is from a defense in depth perspective,\\nit's okay to have the same capability\\nas long as it's part of different strategies.\\nIt's not okay to say\\nI'm going to have the same capability in the same place\\nand call that defense in depth.\\nThat's not really how security best practice works\\nwhen it comes to defense in depth.\\nWhen it comes to best practice,\\nwhen it comes to this defense in depth concept,\\nin the beginning it was really simple.\\n\\nYou basically had your perimeter.\\nYou had a firewall antivirus,\\nbasically security around your resources.\\nHowever, what happened was you had breaches.\\nYou had insider threats,\\nthings within your perimeter\\nthat basically would cause a challenge.\\nTherefore, security needed more capabilities.\\nSo when the perimeter is breached,\\nthere's another defense\\nto basically respond to the insider threat\\nor the next phase of the chain attack.\\n\\nAll of this has led to this idea of needing defense in depth\\nto basically stop\\nthese different steps an attacker will take\\nto basically accomplish whatever goal.\\nIn the security industry, we call this threat mapping.\\nNow in this slide here,\\nI'm showing example of what's called the cyber kill chain.\\nThere are many threats out, maps out there,\\nbut the idea is you want to understand hypothetically\\nhow an attacker could more or less accomplish their goal.\\nIn this example here,\\nthis first stage, this first section,\\nis all about how an attacker could potentially figure out\\nyour vulnerabilities.\\n\\nBasically what research they would do\\nto more or less plan how they're going to attack you.\\nOnce they do that research, that reconnaissance,\\nthen they're going to move to creating the exploit\\nand launching the attack.\\nThis gets into section two\\nof how they're going to attack you.\\nHere then they launch their attack\\nand hopefully gain a foothold.\\nOnce they have that foothold,\\nthey then move into the third section here,\\nwhich is maybe it's repeat the cycle\\nto get deeper in the network.\\n\\nMaybe it's to then listen,\\ncollect data, whatever it may be,\\nbut they're going to start doing something,\\nso some response as a result of a successful attack.\\nWhich then all eventually leads to the final piece here,\\nwhich is the combination of chain exploitation\\nto accomplish some goal.\\nOn the defender side using a threat map,\\nthe idea is this thinking about what tools,\\nwhat capabilities, what people and process should you use\\nto more or less reduce the risk of these steps.\\n\\nSo in this first section here,\\nthe tools we're talking about\\nare tools to limit the visibility the attacker would have\\nso they can't more or less understand your vulnerabilities\\nand there are less likely to create a successful attack.\\nSo things like encryption with your VPN.\\nSo I want to protect my traffic\\nso they can't see what I'm doing.\\nMaybe it's firewalls, segmentation, all these tools.\\nThen when you get into the second phase,\\nthis is more of tools used\\nto reduce the risk of being exploited.\\n\\nSo this will be your IPS IDSs,\\nagain, maybe a firewall.\\nLike when the attacker watches the attack,\\nthe hope is you prevent that attack.\\nThen when you get to the third phase,\\nthis is not preventing attacks.\\nThis is a different phase of defense.\\nThis is what's assumed the attack was successful,\\nnow we need to be able to identify\\nthat the attack has happened\\nand then basically limit the exposure.\\nSo create a response,\\ntry to reduce the risk of it spreading,\\nand more or less try to prevent the incident\\nfrom moving into something serious.\\n\\nAlso, what's important about this last phase\\nis you need this to validate the previous phase.\\nLike how do you know that you've not been compromised\\nif you're never monitoring to see\\nif the attacker actually got in\\nor if something actually has got past\\nyour perimeter defenses.\\nSo again, this is just a high level concept\\nof looking at threat mapping,\\nwhich is on the defender's side\\ntrying to predict how attackers will attack you\\nand then applying the right Lego pieces or right tools\\nto reduce the risk of each of these steps.\\n\\nAll this leads to a slide I've created\\nthat you're going to see throughout this training.\\nThis is, in my opinion,\\nthe security capabilities\\nthat every organization around the world,\\nregardless of business type, should have.\\nThis is to me, security best practice capabilities.\\nAnd the way I've created this slide\\nis first understand there can be more capabilities\\nthat are like subsets that I'm not showing here,\\nor it can be more high level,\\nbut this is kind of a balanced neutral list of capabilities.\\n\\nThe focus is on the user and user experience.\\nSo right away you may say,\\n\\\"Well, where does the user exist?\\nI don't see an inside, an outside, a DMZ.\\\"\\nAnd in the concept of zero trust and in modern security,\\nthat shouldn't matter.\\nSecurity should not matter if I'm in the office, at home,\\nor having a coffee somewhere in the world.\\nHence, there is no location for this user.\\nBut it's very important to secure that user,\\nsecure the data that exists regardless of the location.\\n\\nThen you have the actual data itself.\\nAs you recall, CIA,\\nconfidentiality, integrity, availability.\\nIt's all about data.\\nTherefore, there should be capabilities\\nand a practice around data security.\\nAnd that data is going to live somewhere.\\nIt's either going to be in a data center.\\nAnd I'm kind of grouping together,\\nwhether it's on-prem or basically a cloud-based data center\\nlike a Amazon or Azure from Microsoft.\\nDoesn't matter.\\nThere's going to be a data center that's hosting the data\\nor there's going to be a pure cloud environment,\\nSaaS environment, so like a Dropbox, Box,\\nsomething where you have no responsibility,\\nit's purely outsourced to a cloud provider.\\n\\nBut either of these use cases,\\nthis would be where the data potentially could live\\nand there needs to be capabilities and security around that.\\nThen you have the security operations center\\nthat is responsible for monitoring security,\\nboth from the user, the identities,\\nand where the data lives.\\nAnd then lastly, there's this idea of IoT, the exception.\\nThis is where you have other vulnerabilities,\\nother exceptions that can't use the same capabilities\\nthat would exist in your traditional security\\nlike a firewall or something,\\nhence there's a focus\\nfor like this exception area of security.\\n\\nThis to me is what I would call best practice for security.\\nThese are the capabilities that should exist.\\nI'm not saying that you need all of this,\\nbut what I am saying\\nis if you wanted a reference architecture\\nand something to more or less look against to see\\nif you're making the proper assessments,\\nthis will be the map\\nthat I'll be using throughout this course,\\nand this will be what I suggest,\\nwhat I call heat mapping,\\nyou should heat map against.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3959591\",\"duration\":835,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Cloud (AKA \u201cas a service\u201d) is the

over again when the pandemic occurred\\nto basically help organizations shift\\nto a remote work environment.\\nSo it doesn't matter the business, they may have X amount,\\nlet's say 200 VPN users,\\nwhen the COVID-19 happened, they would shift\\nto potentially thousands of users needing remote access.\\nSo I would get a phone call saying,\\n\\\"Can you please get my license upgraded right now,\\\"\\n\\\"because I have everybody working from home.\\\"\\nThis actually broke the traditional security environment,\\nbecause traditional security\\nbasically is buying appliances\\nand forcing traffic through,\\nwhich on-premise, or in the office, isn't such a big deal.\\n\\nHowever, if you're going to force hundreds of thousands\\nof remote workers through this stack of security,\\nit's just not going to work.\\nAnd what I found happened is most organizations doing this\\nwere not able to maintain the same level of security.\\nThat user experience became extremely poor,\\nand in response, security capabilities had to be turned off.\\nSo basically they would say, only traffic going\\nto these resources are going to be secured,\\nwhich as an exception, ignore everything else.\\n\\nAnd that is not proper security.\\nSo rather than trying to make the old way work,\\nbasically organizations realized we need to make a shift,\\nwe need to change how we're doing things.\\nWhat I mean by this change in security, is this idea\\nof shifting from owning hardware, forcing traffic\\nthrough a stack, to leveraging cloud.\\nIt's, I mean, one prime example, I used to do demos\\nthrough having appliances in my garage, driving my wife nuts\\nwith the power bill and the sound.\\n\\nBut why would I do that?\\nI mean, the cost to buy appliances, run the appliance.\\nWhat if I have a power outage?\\nWhat if my kid sees the blinking light and unplugs it?\\nAnd then just all of the money to like run this thing,\\nyou know, the heat, the the energy costs.\\nI can do that, or I can just build a demo,\\nput it in the cloud,\\nand when I need to use it, turn it on,\\nbe billed less than a penny\\nto run my demo and then pause it.\\nAnd I have all the power of the cloud,\\nI have the latest servers, I have all this redundancy,\\nand it just costs me next to nothing to do it,\\nI just have the resources when I need it.\\n\\nIt just fundamentally makes sense.\\nSo bringing this model to security,\\nthe old model was, you basically are buying appliances.\\nSo I have my firewall here, I got my IPS here.\\nI got my breach detection\\n'cause I want to basically do defense in depth.\\nSo I create this stack, maybe do the same thing\\nas a backup at your other backup location.\\nAnd then when people are on-prem,\\ntheir traffic is going through this stack.\\nHowever, if I'm going to work from home,\\nI'm going to use a VPN, a virtual private network\\nand still force traffic through this stack,\\nwhich worked in the past.\\n\\nBut if you send 3000 users home,\\nand they're all working from this stack, as you can see,\\nwe're creating a bottleneck.\\nThis just doesn't work.\\nSo the new model, what's happened is,\\nwe need to realize people should work from anywhere\\nand maintain the same security.\\nSo it doesn't matter where this user's at,\\nthis stack should always be there.\\nSo if I am in China, or if a user is in Australia,\\nor if a user is on-prem, they are always going\\nthrough the same stack,\\nbut it's not necessarily going through a VPN,\\nand going through the same technology.\\n\\nEssentially, this cloud can be here\\nfor this user, here for this user,\\nso they're getting the best experience.\\nThis is the idea of cloud-based security.\\nAnd this is why pretty much every vendor out there\\nhas shifted to this model.\\nSo they're basically saying \\\"security as a service,\\\"\\n\\\"security always available\\\" versus \\\"buy my appliance.\\\"\\nAnd it's your responsibility to install\\nand force traffic through it.\\nNow, when some of you hear the term \\\"cloud\\\",\\nyou're like, \\\"Oh, my god, I have no experience,\\\"\\n\\\"I have no understanding of cloud.\\\"\\nSo let me make it simple for you.\\n\\nThis is a really good chart to kind of break down the I idea\\nof cloud, which is basically outsourcing.\\nOn the complete left side, the blue side, is no cloud,\\nessentially it's you're doing everything yourself.\\nEverything is on-prem.\\nThink of a data center that you run with your applications\\nand servers, et cetera,\\nbut you have to do everything\\nfrom the power, physical security, it's all on you.\\nBack to my garage scenario,\\nthis would be me running a server in my garage,\\nrunning my applications, and I have to do everything,\\nthat just doesn't make sense.\\n\\nAnd what's happening is,\\npeople in organizations are starting\\nto outsource the physical components.\\nAnd this gets into the idea of IaaS,\\nor infrastructure as a service, where you go\\nto like an Amazon or Azure or Google and say,\\n\\\"You know what?\\\"\\n\\\"You deal with the physical components.\\\"\\nThis means physical security, power, all that kind of stuff.\\nJust give me a clean environment,\\nso I can install my systems, install my applications,\\nand run my environment.\\nSo the equivalent of basically me getting rid of\\nthat server out of my garage,\\nbut still having a open platform in the cloud that I have\\nto configure, and basically, I can do whatever I want with.\\n\\nNow in a lot of cases, I may not need to have a open system.\\nIt actually may be more work than value, meaning now I have\\nto consider the vulnerabilities, the patching,\\nthe upgrading of that system.\\nMaybe I want to also outsource that,\\nwhich gets into platform as a service,\\nwhere you say, \\\"You know what,\\\"\\n\\\"I need a clean version of Windows,\\\"\\nas an example,\\n\\\"that's patch secure, ready to go.\\\"\\nSo now I'm outsourcing even more,\\nso I can run my application on Windows, and do my thing.\\nBut even then in that scenario you may say,\\n\\\"I just want to run this one specific thing,\\\"\\nan example like Gmail, I just need email\\nor something like that.\\n\\nNow we're getting to SaaS, software as a service,\\nwhere you literally are just outsourcing everything\\nand just focusing on what you need to accomplish.\\nAnd that's really what the cloud is.\\nCloud is basically the idea\\nof outsourcing different components.\\nAnd there's certain reasons, certain values\\nand reasons why you would go one way or the other,\\nwhen it comes to how much outsourcing you're going to do.\\nMaybe you need to have controls,\\nhence you need infrastructure as a service,\\nbecause you're doing a lot of customization.\\nOr maybe it's a scenario where you're like,\\n\\\"You know what?\\\"\\n\\\"I need something simple and easy.\\\"\\nAnd that extra work,\\nthat extra risk, doesn't make sense,\\nand you move farther down the outsourcing model\\ninto like platform or software as a service.\\n\\nAnd when I mentioned security products,\\nthe vendors are doing the same thing.\\nSo think of your capability, firewall.\\nThere is a firewall as a service, even SOC,\\nsecurity operations center, there's a SOC as a service.\\nAnd that's really what cloud is.\\nTo give you an example of what I'm talking about,\\nhere I am in a restaurant, this would be the idea\\nof Software as a Service.\\nThink about it, if you go to a restaurant,\\nyou are outsourcing everything.\\nYou're not cooking, you're not growing things.\\n\\nYou essentially are provided a menu,\\nand you say this is what you can order,\\nand you're getting basically somebody else\\nto create the meal for you.\\nThere are pros and cons of this.\\nSome of the common pros would be\\nthat you're getting top-notch cooking.\\nI believe I'm a pretty good cook,\\nbut I don't do that for a living.\\nSo when I go to a restaurant,\\nideally I'm getting the best meal possible.\\nAlso, I don't have any cleanup, I don't have\\nto worry about any other things,\\nI eat my meal and I leave.\\nHowever, there are cons to this approach.\\n\\nThis is likely a much more costly approach to eating.\\nAnd as people would say, you typically want to balance.\\nYou don't want to eat out every night,\\nbecause you want to try to save money by not having\\nto basically spend topnotch dollars\\non eating at a restaurant.\\nWhich moves us to an example\\nof infrastructure as a service, or IaaS,\\nthis would be an equivalent of you eating at home,\\ncooking your own food.\\nNow the reason why there's still some outsourcing is,\\nI assume most of you are not farmers,\\nyou're not growing your own ingredients.\\n\\nSo you're still outsourcing, which would be the equivalent\\nof like IaaS, where you're basically outsourcing\\nthe physical security.\\nYet once you buy your ingredients from a grocery store,\\nyou can do whatever you want.\\nYou can cook a lot of things.\\nYou can cook in bulk.\\nSo typically, the pros of this is, it's less expensive.\\nYou can cook a lot more, you have a lot more controls.\\nThe cons though is, maybe you're not as great of a cook,\\nso you don't have the expertise of like a chef.\\nAnd there's many other scenarios,\\nlike you have to clean it up, the mess that you make.\\n\\nAnd if you don't use ingredients,\\nyou got wasted ingredients, et cetera, et cetera.\\nSo this is a good example of understanding outsourcing,\\nbecause also, in your other environment,\\ngoing to a restaurant, you can't go to a sushi restaurant\\nand order hamburgers or pizza.\\nSo another con to\\nthat approach is the limitations of the menu,\\nlike there's expectations.\\nSo think of it like in the cloud world\\nas you have a contract\\nor an agreement, you can't break that agreement.\\nLike you can't go to a restaurant\\nand order outside the menu, where,\\nwhen you are here at home,\\nI can cook whatever I want.\\n\\nI am making the the agreements.\\nHowever, at the same time, I also have to be the expert.\\nI can mess up that meal.\\nI can add too much salt or pepper,\\nand basically spoil that meal.\\nSo again, there are reasons why you would go one way\\nor the other or something in between.\\nBut it's a good way to kind of mentally understand\\nwhat is the difference between\\nlike fully outsourcing software as a service,\\nor doing like a partial hybrid scenario\\nwhere you outsource some things,\\nlike basically growing the vegetables, growing the food,\\nyet you still have the control\\nto basically cook your own food.\\n\\nWhat this whole cloud environment has led\\nto is a change in architecture.\\nSo the traditional architecture is very network focused.\\nYou basically have your network\\nwhere you would have your security technologies,\\nand then from there, the user would be forced to go\\nthrough the network, hence go through security\\nto then get access to their resources.\\nWhether it's a datacenter,\\na infrastructure as a service in the cloud, or the cloud.\\nYou go through the network\\nbefore you get access to these resources.\\n\\nAnd then on top of that,\\nyou have your security operation center responsible\\nfor monitoring all this stuff.\\nThis is an old model, it's broken, because it doesn't scale.\\nIf you've got hundreds of users, thousands of users,\\ntrying to go through this network, well how do you extend\\nthat network outside of thousands\\nof VPNs, forcing users through a bottleneck?\\nAlso, how does the security operations center monitor\\nthis network that we're talking about\\nas well as all the various places where data could exist?\\nIt just doesn't make sense.\\n\\nHence the modern security environment,\\nand what cloud has done, is cloud has said the network\\ndoesn't really matter anymore.\\nIt's more about the user experience, the data, and more\\nor less accessing that data.\\nSo if you remove the network from this,\\nand you start looking at datacenter as being one thing,\\nwhether it's on-prem, or in the cloud,\\n'cause again, as we just talked about with cloud,\\nyou're just outsourcing certain components\\nof the datacenter.\\nDatacenter really is basically one component.\\n\\nThen you have the option of completely outsourcing, SaaS,\\nand then you have your SOC basically monitoring.\\nThis is what's led me and a lot of experts\\nto look at the world of security\\nand capabilities as basically something such as this,\\nwhich is your users using and accessing data.\\nSo data having its capabilities,\\na datacenter, regardless of how it's being outsourced.\\nThen you have a completely outsourced SaaS environment,\\nso your Gmails, box, et cetera.\\n\\nBut basically, these being the places where data can exist,\\nyou have basically your security operations center,\\nhaving to monitor the data, monitor the users,\\nmonitor how cloud is being used\\nwhen it comes to a full outsource,\\nas well as monitoring the datacenter.\\nAnd then finally, the exceptions,\\nwhich IoT being an example,\\nwhere there's just nothing you really can do other\\nthan monitoring and segmenting.\\nSo IoT representing the exceptions.\\nThis, in my mind, is what's led to\\nwhat I would call the best practice.\\n\\nThis is where you'll be seeing this throughout the course\\nwhen it comes to looking at capabilities.\\nThis is a best practice architecture\\nand this is why cloud has such an impact to get us\\nto where we're at today with this type of architecture.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3966181\",\"duration\":627,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Secure access service edge

Let's talk about an important concept in cybersecurity,\\nwhich is a trend or a shift\\nthat's happening regarding how security technology\\nis being delivered.\\nFirst, you have traditional cybersecurity,\\nwhich was perimeter-based.\\nSo, essentially, you had\\ntechnology like firewalls (marker scraping)\\nand those firewalls could exist\\nin many parts of the network.\\nBut traditionally speaking,\\nyou would have (marker scraping)\\na outside network, a inside network,\\nand then some kind of DMZ.\\n\\nAnd the idea is when users are on network,\\nthey can connect their traffic and go out\\nand in through this firewall.\\nAlso to protect the users,\\nthere's various host-based capabilities such as antivirus.\\nThis was fine until more elaborate security\\ncapabilities were needed.\\nSo, vendors would come up with these new ideas\\nand offer as appliances.\\nAnd what eventually happened\\nis you start stacking (marker scraping)\\non new capabilities.\\n\\nMaybe you get a NextGen firewall\\nthat has different capabilities\\nor you have dedicated solutions\\nfor like IPS, content filtering and so forth.\\nSo, the idea is as you're on the network\\nand you try to surf, go upload, download technology,\\nwhatever you're doing,\\nyou're going through security.\\nNow, the question that would happen,\\nwell what happens when this employee needs to go home?\\nTo maintain security, (marker scraping)\\none traditional common approach was to set up a VPN,\\nwhich is basically encrypting traffic\\nby putting a VPN in here\\nand basically saying every time you want to go\\nto the internet or do things,\\nforce a a connection back\\nto the corporate network\\nand force traffic through the stack\\nbefore you go out to the internet\\nor go to an internal resource.\\n\\nNow, fundamentally it works,\\nbut as things have changed\\nand become more modern,\\nsince the Covid pandemic,\\nall these challenges have broken this model.\\nFor example, one VPN user, sure that works.\\nWhat if you take the entire organization like\\nduring the pandemic,\\nlet's say 10,000 users.\\nThat's a lot of traffic\\nthat's being forced through this,\\nnot to mention as you add capabilities,\\nyou're slowing down traffic\\n'cause you're creating pit stops.\\nOne big one is definitely the idea of SSL,\\nwhich is like you have to actually decrypt\\nand re-encrypt the traffic\\nin order for other capabilities\\nto analyze the traffic properly.\\n\\nSo, what happens is as there's too much traffic\\nand this pipeline becomes a bottleneck,\\nnaturally, organizations need to keep business running\\nand start shutting down capabilities\\nor start doing what's called selective decryption,\\nwhere they're only encrypting certain traffic\\nor more or less protecting certain traffic.\\nSo, if the user needs to go to the internet,\\nthey're just bypassing security.\\nOther challenges is not only this idea of having a stack,\\nbut also where it should exist.\\nBecause traditionally speaking,\\napplications and resources would be in a data center,\\nand it's fine if the data center's\\nbehind this security stack\\nor if you build your own security stack\\nfor the data center\\nas a user wants to access things.\\n\\nBut data centers today are really hybrid-oriented,\\nmeaning some stuff tends to be on on-prem\\nand then now people are leveraging the cloud.\\n(marker scraping)\\nSo, the data center could be Amazon,\\ncould be Microsoft Azure,\\nGoogle Cloud or something else.\\nAnd these data centers sometimes are connected,\\nsometimes they're independent.\\nSo, if an application is here,\\nsure when the user wants to go through security,\\nkind of makes sense.\\nBut what if they're off network, going directly here?\\nNow, you need to create another stack of technology,\\nwhich by the way, this is cloud-based.\\n\\nSo, now we need to go back to the vendors\\nand say, I need virtual versions of this.\\nSo, if I have my NextGen firewall,\\nI need a virtual version\\nof the NextGen firewall, adding more complexity,\\n'cause now if you want to manage this,\\nyou're going to have to create some additional,\\nwe call it super-manager\\nthat can manage both the on-prem and cloud\\nand maintain a security policy.\\nSo, basically what's happening\\nis people are taking old school thought\\nand trying to like bolt on band-aids\\nas new challenges are being made,\\nwhich just doesn't work.\\n\\nSo, there's a shift,\\nthere's a change that's happening\\nto fix a lot of these challenges\\nand that change is commonly referred\\nto as Secure Access Service Edge or SASE\\nor sometimes even called SSE, Secure Service Edge.\\nWhat that means is not just changing everything,\\nbut it's more of using a different approach.\\nSo, we still need our stack of technology.\\nIt's not like we can get rid of things\\nlike firewalls, IPs (marker scraping)\\nor other capabilities,\\nbut what we do need to do is figure out how\\nto fix the bottleneck issue,\\nfigure out how to scale\\nand also collapse different areas into one policy.\\n\\nNow, there are different ways to do this,\\nand I'm remaining vendor-neutral here,\\nbut the general concept works like this.\\nYou take the security stack\\nthat people used to buy as appliances\\nand have to deal with managing and running\\nand forcing traffic through, using things like routing,\\n'cause like from what we call a north-south perspective,\\nyou we need to route traffic in and out of the network.\\nBut like an east to west perspective,\\nmeaning trying to go from inside network A\\nto inside B, still needs to have a way\\nto route traffic through security\\nor else security is not being applied.\\n\\nSo, rather than like trying\\nto figure out this complex networking with SASE\\nor SSE, we're putting the same capabilities in the cloud.\\nAnd the idea is,\\nit doesn't matter where you're at in the world.\\nYou can be inside, outside,\\nyou can be at home, Starbucks, doesn't matter.\\nThere is no outside or inside\\nbecause this is basically\\n(marker scraping)\\non the internet.\\nSo, if I'm in China, if I'm at home in the USA,\\nif I'm at the corporate office,\\nthe idea is whatever network connection makes sense for me,\\nwhatever's most optimized for me,\\nthat's where security will live.\\n\\nSo, essentially,\\n(marker scraping)\\nthis user, wherever they're at in the world,\\nwill have their traffic forced\\nthrough the security stack,\\nbut that stack is not an appliance\\nor something routed through to,\\nbut instead something that exists in the cloud.\\nThe other idea is thinking about collapsing things.\\nSo, traditionally speaking,\\nhaving a data center\\nthat you want to access could have its own policies,\\nbut what makes more sense is,\\nis looking at the the applications, themself,\\nregardless of location,\\nso, collapsing that as well,\\nmeaning you can\\nhave your Amazon, (marker scraping)\\nhave your Azure,\\nhave your on-prem data center,\\nbut use different techniques to more or less connect these\\nand have them access this SASE or SSE cloud,\\nso, essentially to the user's perspective,\\nit's just the application being available.\\n\\nSo, the idea is we're first removing the bottleneck issue\\nbecause as people around the world are connecting,\\nthey're going through this cloud-based environment.\\nSo, long as the SASE environment is designed correctly,\\nthey should always have good performance.\\nThe other challenge about the unifying policies\\nis you can create all of your security capabilities\\nin one cloud architecture\\nand then essentially have all the end results\\nbasically, filter through that,\\nso, when users and devices\\nand applications need to connect to something,\\nthey go through the SASE architecture.\\n\\nThis solves a lot of the challenges here,\\nsimplifies security and also kind of makes sense\\nbecause if you think about like just modern technology,\\nif I'm doing a demo,\\nwhy do I need to buy hardware,\\nrun it in my garage,\\ndrive my wife nuts by dealing with all that\\nwhen my whole goal,\\nthe whole outcome I want is\\nto show this technology, show this demo.\\nIt makes more sense\\nto essentially outsource some of this stuff\\nand basically just have the capabilities available\\nvia cloud, which is essentially\\nwhat we're talking about with SASE or SSE.\\n\\nNow, the term, SASE, at times is referring\\nto different ways to connect to this,\\nwhere SSE is typically security-focused,\\nbut in both cases what the other factor\\nto consider is, getting traffic in the cloud.\\nAgain, remaining vendor-neutral,\\nthere are different ways to do this\\ndepending on who you're working with.\\nOne option could be an agent,\\nso you stick an agent\\nand that agent essentially is what's forcing\\ntraffic through the cloud.\\nThat's one option.\\nAnother option,\\nand we'll switch colors for this,\\ncould be maybe having a,\\nwhat we call SD-WAN,\\nor basically having the network route traffic through there.\\n\\nSo, basically these users can connect\\nto the corporate office,\\nbut the corporate office will have the router\\nand the router rather than routing traffic like over here,\\nso, we'll put a router here,\\nThe router typically would route traffic through that.\\nThe router instead would use SD-WAN\\nand route traffic through the SASE environment.\\nTechnically speaking, SASE could also be\\nat the application edge.\\nSo, if you have\\napplication edges\\n(marker scraping)\\nand the user is trying to access the application,\\nthat edge could have 'em do a pit stop\\nand run 'em through security.\\n\\nSo, it doesn't matter specifically how it's done,\\nthe concept is what matters,\\nwhich is basically getting rid\\nof this traditional buying hardware, forcing traffic\\nthrough it via complex routing and VPNs\\nand moving more\\nto like a as a service model\\nor cloud-based security model\\nwhere the same capabilities\\nas well as additional new things that can be invented\\nor a reality by having this model,\\nbut put all whatever capability it is,\\nin this cloud-based model,\\nfigure out a way to get the user traffic\\nor application traffic through this centralized point,\\nwhether it's an agent using like SD-WAN\\nor some kind of routing component or something else,\\nor even when they try to access the application,\\nforce it that way,\\nbut force it through the security model\\nand then from there,\\ncontrol that down to one policy.\\n\\nThis essentially is what we call SASE,\\nSecure Access Service Edge or SSE.\\nThis essentially is modern security\\nand basically, if you're going to be thinking about zero trust,\\nit's very likely you're going to be looking at the deficiencies\\nof this kind of architecture\\nand building something around this type of model.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2022572\",\"duration\":341,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Threat

In the cybersecurity industry,\\nto understand the attack behavior, we use threat maps.\\nWhat I'm showing here is a common threat map\\nknown as a cyber kill chain,\\nwhich is basically broken down to a couple sections.\\nYou have the first section, which is how the attackers\\nmore or less understand the target\\nso they can create in their mind the easiest\\nand most effective route to attack.\\nYou have the second section, which is creating\\nand launching such attack,\\nand then finally you have the third section, which is,\\nwhat is the result of that attack?\\nMaybe relaunching a sequence to go deeper into a network\\nor deeper into a system,\\nor it may be listening, stealing data, et cetera.\\n\\nAnd the combination of these outcomes leads to some goal.\\nIn the world of defense, we do threat mapping\\nto basically decide what LEGO pieces I should apply\\nto reduce the risk of that step.\\nSo maybe I'm using firewalls, maybe I'm using encryption,\\nbut basically I'm using certain security tools\\nto reduce the risk of this section.\\nThen for looking at exploitation,\\nI'm going to be looking at IPSs, IDSs, maybe antivirus,\\nanti-malware, but basically tools to try to reduce the risk\\nof an actual exploit, which then I need to think,\\nwell, what happens if this doesn't work?\\nHow do I validate to make sure that these tools are working?\\nGet me into basically the third phase,\\nwhich is breach detection, monitoring.\\n\\nSo I assume the attacker has made it to this point\\nof the attack kill chain,\\nand now I need to look for that result, that behavior.\\nMaybe it's reconnaissance inside my network,\\nmaybe it's data leaving my network, but it's different tools\\nand I need to be basically looking at\\nbreach defense type tools as well as\\nthe persistent component,\\nwhich is basically taking the events\\nfrom all these other tools.\\nMaybe it's my firewall, maybe it's my IPS in this case,\\nmaybe it's my breach tool, and taking all these events\\nand trying to understand this whole thing\\nas being a attack event.\\n\\nSo individual components equal...\\nWe have this scenario where I can figure out\\nas the defender an attack is occurring\\nand this is what stage they're at of the attack.\\nThis is the potential impact,\\nso I can then respond properly.\\nWhen it comes to threat maps, the industry by far\\nsees MITRE ATT&CK as being the defacto\\nor probably the most popular threat map that is used.\\nThere are many out there,\\nbut MITRE ATT&CK is definitely the most referenced one\\nthat me and others tend to use\\nwhen it comes to mapping out potential threat behaviors.\\n\\nIt's very popular because it has a lot of options\\nbecause attackers can take many different steps\\nto do the same thing.\\nFor example, an exploit can be many, many things.\\nIt can be a very technical attack on a vulnerability,\\nor it can be attacking humans via phishing attacks.\\nIf you've never seen MITRE ATT&CK, to find it,\\nyou can simply Google Search MITRE ATT&CK\\nor go to attack.mitre.org\\nand you'll end up on a screen like this.\\n\\nWhen you scroll down,\\nyou'll see the famous MITRE ATT&CK threat map.\\nAnd how it works, like any threat map,\\nyou basically have the first scenarios the attacker can use\\nand it will work its way from left to right\\nas potential attack campaigns could occur.\\nWhat's great about this is there are many options\\nto really represent a real world scenario.\\nSo for example, if an attacker is doing reconnaissance\\nand researching and they're going to go the route\\nof actively scanning the environment, you can click this\\nto understand what this step actually means,\\nas well as the different types of active scanning\\nthat could occur.\\n\\nMITRE also includes mitigations\\nor recommendations that you can do\\nto basically reduce the risk of this threat.\\nSo as you look at this kill chain\\nand you start working through the potential paths,\\nthere are hundreds of potential paths\\nbecause the attacker could do the same first reconnaissance\\nand resource development,\\nbut then take a different initial access\\nto try to accomplish its goal.\\nSo it's a really good tool to look at and say,\\nwhen is my real risk?\\nHow can an attacker potentially attack my organization?\\nAnd you can do things known as tabletop workshops\\nwhere you essentially work through hypothetical examples\\nsuch as, let's say there's a ransomware attack.\\n\\nWhat would the attacker do\\nto research your environment, initially get access,\\nexecute that attack, and more or less pivot\\nthroughout your network to eventually end up in a scenario\\nwhere they've compromised multiple systems\\nand holding your data at ransom.\\nIt's a great way also to understand\\nwhat tools you have in place,\\nidentify gaps in your security, people, process,\\nand technology, and use a third-party best practice\\nreference like MITRE to say,\\nwell, what should I do in this case?\\nMeaning you can click this, look at the mitigation\\nand see recommendations around what you should do\\nto improve your security.\\n\\nMITRE is definitely one of the most common\\nand popular references,\\nbut there are many other options of threat maps out there\\nthat you can use to better understand the threat landscape\\nand your potential defense against such risk.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3963533\",\"duration\":1263,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Security

application from occurring.\\n\\nNow, there are some vendors\\nthat talk about this being evil.\\nThey may say, \\\"Oh, we don't use signatures\\\"\\nbecause it's easy to bypass this capability.\\nIf you have this list of capability of signatures,\\nand as a defender's tool, I'm looking for these things,\\nthen the attacker knows, well,\\nhow do I not be on that list, so I can bypass that?\\nAnd what they can do is they can do adding junk\\nor encoding or obfuscation or polymorphism,\\nbut basically, it's taking something\\nthat would be on that list, adding stuff to it\\nso it looks like something new,\\nand then, basically, it won't match\\non that list and get through.\\n\\nSo essentially signatures could be effective,\\nbut they can also be easily bypassed\\nif that's your only layer of security.\\nThen you get to the second section,\\nwhich is behavior-based security tools.\\nAnd the way this works is you're looking for evil behavior,\\nso maybe port scanning or for ransomware\\nlooking for the encryption behavior.\\nSo it's kind of like signatures,\\nbut it's more of like a general list of look out\\nfor these behaviors, which could be more effective\\nthan a signature, but at the same time,\\nthere are ways to get around it.\\n\\nOn the attacker side, if you know the behavior,\\nlike for example, port scanning,\\nthen what you can do is use stealth.\\nSo you can say, I'm going to use this behavior,\\nbut I'm going to do it periodically so it's not noisy.\\nIt's not ideally going to be seen\\nby these behavior tools to allow me\\nto get away with whatever I'm doing.\\nSo as an attacker, I can say, all right,\\nto bypass these first capabilities,\\nI'll create something that is not going to be known\\nin the signature list to get past that,\\nand I'm going to use stealth.\\n\\nI'm good to go.\\nAnd this is where the third capability comes in\\nor the third section of of security capabilities,\\nwhich gets into anomaly technology or baselining.\\nAnd the idea is you say, well,\\nrather than specifically looking for signatures\\nor specifically looking for behaviors,\\nlet's look holistically at what is considered normal?\\nLet's create a baseline of traffic.\\nAnd anytime we see any anomalies\\nor things falling outside that baseline,\\nanalyze those as potential threats.\\n\\nNow we get to something very interesting\\nbecause as an attacker, I have to create my attack\\nthat is not going to be on the list.\\nSo I have to use polymorphism, whatever he may be,\\nto basically not be triggered.\\nThen to get past my signatures, my behavior scenarios,\\nI got to use stealth.\\nI have to hide.\\nBut the more stealth that I do,\\nthe more I'm going to be outside the baseline.\\nSo actually, the more I try\\nto beat the behavior capabilities,\\nthe more the anomaly is going to pick it up.\\nAnd if I try to be normal,\\nif I try to be within the baseline,\\nthen my behavior potentially could be seen\\nor I just can't execute what I want to execute.\\n\\nSo as you can see, the combination of these three\\nis extremely effective.\\nAnd this is where when I meet with a vendor\\nor I go to a security conference\\nand I'm being pitched, \\\"Hey, we do zero trust and AI\\\"\\nand all this stuff that they're promising,\\nin the end I try to boil down, well,\\nhow are you actually accomplishing these goals?\\nNow, some vendors may say, well, signatures are evil.\\nI don't agree because, for example,\\nif I'm using threat intelligence,\\nso what I want to do is I want to understand\\nwhat others are seeing out there in the world,\\nwhy would I want to scan every single potential piece of data\\nand behavior using this approach?\\nJust it's a waste of time.\\n\\nIf the threat intelligence, if the outsiders,\\nif the AI is telling me, hey,\\nthat's been seen by something else,\\nso there's an attack campaign\\nhitting a bunch of universities, watch out for that,\\nI want to block it right away with a signature.\\nSo it makes sense to leverage signatures in that regard.\\nHowever, you can't just have this\\nas being your only means,\\nhence why then when you learn about those signatures,\\nmaybe you combine that together\\nand start creating behavior detection capabilities\\nand look for that behavior.\\nBut even this doesn't make sense as being its own thing,\\nhence the idea of big data,\\nwhy cloud is becoming a big deal\\nis the third layer can be,\\nwell, let me see, me versus the rest of the world.\\n\\nFor example, from a endpoint perspective,\\nyou install a file.\\nIf I can pull from the cloud\\nand say, well, the normal behavior\\nfor 80,000 million people using that file is A,\\nhowever, you're the first person where Bs happening,\\nPowerShell is being ran, encryption happening,\\nthat's an anomaly.\\nLet me flag that.\\nYou should look at that.\\nSo this is where like big data cloud\\nkind of comes in as well.\\nLike it can come in to create that baseline\\nversus a baseline just being your environment.\\n\\nSo my personal opinion,\\nthese are the fundamental capabilities,\\nand it's very likely when you talk to a vendor,\\nthey're going to have a blend of these three capabilities\\nin their offering.\\nAnd my recommendation to you is\\nis to challenge the vendor.\\nTalk to 'em about, well,\\nhow does your technology actually work?\\nAnd ask, are you using signatures?\\nAre you using like pattern matching?\\nAre you using behavior?\\nAnd when you are using cloud or AI,\\nhow is that creating a baseline?\\nHow is that giving you an anomaly detection\\nto really understand what the offering is all about?\\nAnother fundamental concept is vulnerabilities.\\n\\nWhat is a vulnerability?\\nA vulnerability essentially is a weakness.\\nNow it can be in a system.\\nSo it could be that you have a unpatched system,\\nthat technology like an exploitation technique\\ncould be used to take advantage of that\\nto accomplish some unwanted outcome.\\nBut a vulnerability can also be people.\\nSo it can also be the idea of social engineering\\nwhere I can trick somebody\\ninto giving me sensitive information\\nsuch as their password,\\nbut a vulnerability can be anything\\nthat essentially could be abused.\\n\\nNow what's key is when it comes to attack and defend,\\nthere must be a vulnerability in order\\nfor the attacker to exploit.\\nIf there's no vulnerability, there's nothing to exploit.\\nHowever, conceptually,\\nthere's always going to be vulnerabilities,\\nand they're always going to be changing\\nin pretty much near real time.\\nIn the industry, to understand vulnerabilities\\nand the potential risk, there are scoring systems.\\nIt's common to use a MITRE-based scoring system\\nwhere a big number means a big risk\\nand a low number means a low risk.\\n\\nAnd when if you break down those numbers,\\nthey actually have a formula.\\nAnd what I'm showing here is one example of such formula.\\nSo in the MITRE world of looking at the scoring,\\nif it's a high score, there's typically components,\\nand it actually relates back to the CIA,\\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability.\\nSo if this vulnerability, for example,\\ncould lead to taking down a system\\nor removing its availability,\\nthat can lead to a potential high score threat.\\n\\nNow if the availability could be taken down completely,\\nmeaning you can literally take it down\\nand you can't get access,\\nthat's going to have a higher score\\nthan if it's no or partial,\\nmeaning maybe you can take down log into the system,\\nbut it's still available for users.\\nThat's a partial availability threat.\\nThe same would apply to other things\\nlike access vector as an example.\\nIf the attacker has to be local on the system,\\nthat is much harder than the attacker\\nbeing anywhere in the world,\\nfor example, being at home,\\nand having the ability to launch that attack.\\n\\nSo think about, for example, in order for me\\nto own this system, I have to physically be in the building.\\nThat's a lower risk,\\nbut if it still works, it is still a risk.\\nIf it doesn't work, then that doesn't impact the score\\n'cause there's no attack vector\\nfor me physically being there.\\nSame for the complexity.\\nIf it's extremely complex,\\nthat would mean that only a certain amount\\nof users can do it.\\nThat's going to be a more low-based risk\\nbecause only a handful of people can do it,\\nbut if it's a script kiddie type scenario\\nwhere you literally can download something\\nand anybody can run it, that's going to be a higher risk.\\n\\nSo if you take a scoring system like a MITRE scoring system\\nand break down why something is a higher risk,\\nthere's typically a combination of different mechanisms\\nthat are being triggered as you kind of weigh this risk\\nto lead to something being a big risk or a big threat.\\nNow I want to point out a key important thing.\\nThese scoring systems that are being used\\nare great as a reference, but they should not be something\\nthat you follow 100% because just because a threat comes out\\nand the scoring system for it is high\\ndoesn't mean that you ignore lower-based scored threats.\\n\\nIt actually could be almost a false sense of security\\nbecause just because something scores\\nat a eight or nine versus a one, two, or three,\\nbut in both scenarios, the result is you get ransomware\\nand your data is encrypted,\\nin both scenarios, you've lost.\\nIf anything, from a security operation perspective,\\nthe attackers are going to hope to be in the lower area\\n'cause they can maybe be in the noise.\\nMaybe you have 40,000 events that are you're dealing with.\\nAnd because you're using a scoring system such as this,\\nyou only look at anything at seven or higher.\\n\\nNow the attackers can hide in the noise\\nby being a three or four.\\nAlso, maybe you're looking at one step of an attack\\nand you're scoring that as low,\\nbut if you take the combination of three\\nor four low scored attacks together,\\nthat's a higher threat.\\nThat should be scored higher.\\nAlso, who's scoring this?\\nJust because somebody is saying\\nthe general view of this is a three or four,\\nbut you are very dependent on what the axis vector is\\nor what's basically potentially at risk here,\\nfor you, that threat would maybe a higher score,\\nmaybe eight or nine, but for the average organization,\\nit may be your two or three.\\n\\nSo scoring systems, as I'm showing here,\\nit's good to know, it's good to understand,\\nbut you should also take consideration\\nyour own environment and take into consideration\\nthat just because something is high or low,\\nthat doesn't actually mean the real value of that threat.\\nTo simplify this idea of vulnerabilities,\\nbasically there's a couple steps to think about.\\nThere is all the research reconnaissance, et cetera\\nthat you would see in the initial stage of a threat map,\\nbut then it's going to lead to some kind of exploit.\\n\\nThat exploit is going to then take advantage\\nof a vulnerability.\\nSo first you're going to have the ranking\\nor the score of what the potential threat is\\nof this exploit to work, which again,\\nthese scoring systems are effective sometimes,\\nbut they shouldn't be what you fully focus on\\nbecause in the end,\\na low or high scored exploit doesn't matter.\\nIf it works, it works in your environment.\\nThere's also what we call\\nthe vulnerability management program.\\nThis is your responsibility\\nto reduce the vulnerabilities\\nbecause, again, if there's no vulnerability,\\nthere's nothing to exploit.\\n\\nThis is very important because some organizations\\nare hyper-focused on preventing the exploit step\\nversus focusing on the vulnerability management program.\\nI, as well as others, are in the big belief\\nthat if you put a lot of energy\\ninto a strong vulnerability management program,\\nyou have less vulnerabilities.\\nIf there's less vulnerabilities,\\nthere's less things to exploit,\\nhence you become more secure.\\nSo from a general security perspective\\nand attack perspective, exploit exploits the vulnerability.\\nBut then you have this next section here,\\nwhich is basically the result of the attack.\\n\\nThis would be your breach scenario.\\nSo this one is going to validate that if you do have tools here\\nthat you're validating that these other tools\\nin your exploit scenario are actually doing their job.\\nBecause if you have no way to view this area,\\nhow do you know that an exploit hasn't happened?\\nThere's no way you're going to know\\nall of your vulnerabilities.\\nSo the assumption should be\\nand the attackers are going to get in,\\nor there's going to be some success.\\n\\nSo in this section here,\\nwe're talking about the result of an attack.\\nAnd then finally, this may be repeated multiple times\\nto lead to some goal.\\nThis is risk 101.\\nIf you're a running a security operation center\\nor you're concerned about the risk of threats,\\nessentially this is what you should be thinking about.\\nHow am I being exploited?\\nWhat vulnerabilities are being exploited?\\nWhat is the results when that attack occurs\\nand the vulnerabilities exploited?\\nAnd then in the end, when you combine this,\\nwhat is the end goal the attacker's doing?\\nThis essentially is risk 101.\\n\\nAnd this is why when you look at a threat map,\\nyou essentially are looking at this exploit\\nagainst a vulnerability and then result scenario\\nbased on different steps of a kill chain.\\nWhat are the attackers exploiting\\nwhen it comes to the research?\\nWhat are the attackers exploiting\\nwhen it comes to getting a foothold?\\nAnd what are the attackers exploiting\\nas they have that foothold\\nand start to do evil malicious things?\\nAnd then as a defender,\\nwhat are the capabilities that you have?\\nWhat are the people, process, and technology\\nfor each of these steps?\\nAnd again, this whole thing is going to be individualized,\\nbut it's also going to be a platform.\\n\\n'Cause in the end, your security operation center\\nis going to be responsible for all this stuff.\\nThis is how you kind of put together threat risk defense.\\nAnd the challenge is going to be with this cat and mouse game\\njust because you put a capability in there\\ndoesn't mean that the capability's always going to be effective\\nbecause of the cat and mouse game concept.\\nFor example, you have your detection capability.\\nIt can be antivirus, it can be whatever it may be,\\nand the tool may work at first,\\nbut the attacker likely has the ability to get access\\nto the same tools as the defender.\\n\\nAnd a lot of popular takedowns will be posted is,\\nhey, we took down this attack environment,\\nand we found that they had every vendor technology\\nfrom Cisco, Palo Alto,\\nfrom whoever in their test environment.\\nBecause just like the defenders,\\nthey're going to take samples of malware\\nto see how effective it is.\\nThe attackers are going to do the same.\\nThey're going to take samples of security technology\\nto see how effective their tool is,\\nand they're going to test until basically that tool fails.\\nAnd once that tool fails,\\nthen they're going to basically attempt to launch their attack.\\n\\nSo attacks and defenders both have labs,\\nand they're both constantly having to change around\\nNow, one key piece is attack environment\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3965243\",\"duration\":437,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Extended detection and response (XDR)

One common topic that comes up often,\\nwe talk about security capabilities in the industry, is XDR.\\nBasically, this represents\\nhow a security operation center is monitoring\\nand responding to security events.\\nWe're talking about a combination of tool.\\nIn my opinion, as well as others,\\nXDR is not a product, it's often talked about as a product,\\nbut it's really more of a platform\\nor combination of capabilities in products.\\n\\nTo better understand what XDR is,\\nlet's break down the components\\nthat exist within an XDR platform.\\nTraditionally, if you talked about monitoring security\\nin the past and traditionally,\\nsecurity capabilities would lead\\nto the conversation of SIEM,\\nwhich represents security information and event management.\\nWhat does SIEM represents is a central plane of glass\\nor tool that you send all of your data to.\\nSo rather than having, let's say 20 security products,\\nyou also have to go to 20 dashboards\\nto understand that data.\\n\\nThe idea of SIEM is, I have one dashboard that ingests\\nand basically consolidates all the events\\nfrom those 20 plus dashboards.\\nThe traditional SIEM, however, can't take action.\\nSo you can see the event,\\nbut when it came to actual responding\\nor doing things, there was really no tool set for that.\\nSo this led to the creation of a new market\\nknown as SOAR, or Security Orchestration,\\nAutomation and Response.\\nAnd in the SOAR market,\\nyou're looking at things like automation,\\nAPIs, integration, taking response,\\nlooking at how effective you are,\\nlooking at the cost per event.\\n\\nAll this kind of holistic action type stuff\\nreally falls under the SOAR landscape.\\nSo if you take vendors, very popular ones,\\nSplunk would be a SIEM.\\nSplunk acquired Phantom to be the SOAR.\\nIBM QRadar would be a SIEM.\\nThey have Resilient as their SOAR.\\nAnd you can pretty much look at every SIEM\\nvendor that came out.\\nThey either acquired or built in SOAR capabilities\\nand eventually changed the offering\\nfrom SIEM and SOAR to XDR.\\n\\nNow, while this was happening,\\nthere was also this other level of security\\nor path of development happening,\\nwhich was happening starting on the endpoint world.\\nSo EDR was basically your endpoint vendors,\\nyour antiviruses, think of like a CrowdStrike kind of vendor\\nthat was really focused on endpoint security.\\nAnd from a SIEM perspective,\\nthey would have their dashboard\\nto monitor the endpoints.\\nHowever, they realized, well,\\nwhat if we add other components,\\nother feeds into our dashboard?\\nSo instead of being EDR, or endpoint detection,\\nwe can add X or extended.\\n\\nAnd basically, if we're taking the idea\\nof what a SIEM does and SOAR,\\nwe're doing the same thing\\nbecause the traditional EDR vendors\\nwould give you actions.\\nIt wasn't just monitoring.\\nIt's an antivirus, antimalware and EDR.\\nSo it has the action built in.\\nSo essentially an EDR is like a SIEM/SOAR for the endpoint.\\nSo if they expand that\\nor extend that XDR to other systems,\\nthey are doing the same thing as a SIEM and SOAR.\\nSo if you take those either paths, buying a SIEM,\\nbuying a SOAR, combining it, or taking a EDR platform\\nand adding more devices, you're getting the same scenario.\\n\\nYou're getting the same XDR outcome,\\nwhich is I have one place to view all my events\\nand have one place to more or less respond,\\nwhich can be APIs, integrations,\\nmonitoring, et cetera.\\nAnd then the actions that you take.\\nThat is what XDR is.\\nAnd that's why I'm saying,\\nand others are saying XDR is not a product.\\nIt is essentially this idea of having the centralized\\nSIEM scenario of viewing\\nand then also the SOAR, XDR scenario\\nof I can take action.\\n\\nThink of it like this.\\nI got my SIEM/SOAR.\\nI got my email tools, my threat intelligence,\\nall the different things that you want to see.\\nAnd I'm giving one place to see it,\\none dashboard for this,\\nas well as when I want to take action,\\none place to monitor and then respond with.\\nThat is XDR.\\nAnd when it comes to using XDR,\\nwhen it comes to what XDR does,\\nit is allowing you to basically have a repeatable process\\nof security capabilities, repeatable process\\nof what the people and process\\nis going to occur when a security event happens.\\n\\nSo in the industry, this is commonly referred\\nto as a playbook.\\nIf you want to understand what would happen\\nif ransomware was to infect this user,\\nrather than just having a different scenario,\\nyou would say, \\\"This is the tool,\\nthese are the people,\\nand this is the process that occurs.\\nLet's document it.\\\"\\nThat turns into a playbook.\\nAnd if you want to be more effective at security,\\nyou're going to want to start to use automation,\\nmeaning you're going to want to start to automate the playbooks.\\n\\nHowever, you can't automate a playbook\\nfully across the board\\nbecause some things are just not ideal for automation.\\nFor example, looking at phishing attacks,\\nthe way an attacker can attack is so different.\\nIt can change in so many ways,\\nit makes sense to have human eyes view that.\\nHowever, once a attack is detected,\\nif the response is to alert these people,\\nthat's in a mundane task,\\nthat's something that's easily could be automated.\\n\\nSo by taking a playbook, laying out the steps\\nof each step of the attack,\\nyou can then look at, all right,\\nof these steps, these are the ones\\nthat require basically our experts or humans.\\nAnd these are the ones that could be automated.\\nAnd from there you can use what's known as DevOps\\nor DevSecOps, which is basically making automation\\nor making things work with things\\nto make your security more effective.\\nSo in short, XDR is the combination\\nof all these security products leading\\nto one place to monitor and respond to events.\\n\\nAnd as an outcome of XDR,\\nSOCs, or security operation centers, can create playbooks,\\nwhich are basically a repeatable thing that,\\nof people process and technology,\\na repeatable outcome to when an attack occurs.\\nAnd in order to make that repeatable process more effective,\\nthey can start to leverage automation\\nthrough DevOps or DevSecOps\\nto basically automate certain things\\nthat are mundane or repetitive tasks\\nthat make sense to automate.\\n\\nSo they can be much more effective\\nwith their cybersecurity.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3963532\",\"duration\":1329,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Securing network, clouds, and

When you look at security capabilities, you can group\\nor categorize security based on this kill chain,\\nthis MITRE ATT&CK, this threat map scenario,\\nwhere there are certain tools\\nthat are applied towards certain steps of such threat maps.\\nOne of those steps is going to be\\nedge based security technologies.\\nThink of this as the scenario of the attacker\\nin that exploitation phase\\nand the defender reducing the risk\\nof the attacker exploiting that vulnerability.\\n\\nThis leads to tools like web application layer firewall\\nor firewalls, next gen firewalls, whatever type of firewall.\\nThis also leads into detection capabilities\\nlike IPS/IDS, concepts like reputation security,\\nwhere you're trying to reduce who\\nor what is allowed to communicate.\\nSo you're saying we only do business with X,\\nso why do we have Y talking to us,\\nwhich is automatically block Y.\\nThat's the idea of reputation.\\nOr it maybe something like X is saying they're X,\\nbut they've been online for two hours hosted from GoDaddy.\\n\\nThey're probably not X, they're not a bank for example.\\nTheir reputation should be they're online for much longer.\\nThis is obviously a phishing or fake scenario.\\nSo that's the idea of reputation, security or proxies.\\nBut all these kind of capabilities I would call edge based\\nsecurity capabilities that\\nas you're doing your defense in depth,\\none or more of these kind of fit this bucket\\nbefore you move to the next stage,\\nwhich is what happens when these fail,\\nthen you would have different types\\nof capabilities involved.\\n\\nAnother category of technology security\\ncapabilities is segmentation.\\nSegmentation is extremely relevant to zero trust\\n'cause zero trust as we get to that section,\\nis going to be about limiting access\\nto only what's needed.\\nBut what is segmentation, is it network segmentation?\\nIs it cloud?\\nIs it even processes like can for example,\\none program on a computer talk\\nto another program on the same computer?\\nAll this is forms of segmentation.\\n\\nSo to break down what segmentation is, I kind\\nof created a reference scenario here of different types\\nof segmentation as you get\\nfrom generic physical segmentation to the most,\\nas people call micro segmentation.\\nTo better understand this,\\nlet's first look at traditional physical segmentation.\\nThis is simple, two separate completely isolated things.\\nSo I have network one, I have network two,\\nI'm running redundant systems, redundant routers, switches,\\napplications, et cetera.\\n\\nSo literally these are the systems\\nand the users all in their own environments\\nand there is no separate connection.\\nThis sometimes called air gap\\nor basically siloed systems is the most secure,\\nbut it's also not the most cost effective\\nand in most cases doesn't make sense.\\nLike if you're going to have a thousand applications,\\nthere's no way that you can build a thousand networks.\\nIt just doesn't make sense.\\nSo even though this is being the most secure,\\nthere is many reasons why you move\\nto down into a virtual segmentation environment,\\nwhich basically means now you're sharing things.\\n\\nSo rather than having two separate networks,\\nnow these networks are sharing physical space and hardware.\\nSo you get into virtual segmentation, this is done\\nto save money, be more effective, allow cross communication.\\nThese are all reasons why you would get\\ninto virtual segmentation.\\nAs you get into virtual segmentation,\\nthe first layer would be physical hardware\\nthat is virtually working in a physical segment scenario.\\n\\nSo for example, let's say a physical firewall.\\nYou may use what's called context is\\nand say I'm going to virtually carve this firewall.\\nAnd from a technology perspective, the firewall believes\\nthat it's completely physically isolated.\\nSo you have a physical separate network,\\nphysical separate network.\\nThis firewall from a hardware\\nand power perspective is one system,\\nbut from a technology perspective,\\nit believes it is two separate systems.\\nSo this system can never talk to this system.\\nIt is managed, it is ran as two separate systems off\\nof the same hardware.\\n\\nThis is very secure.\\nIt also saves some money\\nbecause maybe if you buy this hardware\\nby only running one segment, you're only using 20%\\nof its utilization,\\nthat's 80% that's being wasted or this scenario,\\nnow I can better utilize my hardware,\\nget more bang for my buck.\\nHowever, this also still leads to some of the challenges\\nwith physical segmentation where it just doesn't make sense\\nto run 40,000 firewall contexts.\\nSo what makes sense is to kind of move down\\nto the next layer, which is let's create one network\\nand then within that one network,\\nlet's start to virtually segment off things.\\n\\nSo I have the same firewall hardware with contexts,\\nbut then within this environment,\\nI'm going to create two networks off\\nof the same network hardware.\\nSo this can be routers, switches, et cetera.\\nBut I'm going to virtually create VLANs or virtual LANs.\\nSo this is going to be VLAN one, VLAN two, VLAN three,\\nand each of these are going to be virtually segmented networks.\\nSo a way of thinking about this is from a user perspective,\\nwhen you connect to a network and you're on a VLAN\\nor VLAN one, that is your network\\nand it can have access to certain things that may be shared\\nwith another network or maybe it's not.\\n\\nBut the idea is I am on a virtual LAN\\nthat is shared from a hardware perspective\\nbut from a virtual perspective looks like\\none separate network.\\nAnd then if I connect to VLAN two\\nor a different VLAN the hardware may be the same\\nbut it looks like a completely different network.\\nNow that's good,\\nbut what if you have a VLAN,\\nso let's call this VLAN 20,\\nand you have an application\\nand you have users that are both authorized in that VLAN.\\n\\nAnd you want to prevent one user from having access.\\nInstead of having VLAN VLAN, which doesn't make sense,\\nyou need to have another layer or deeper layer of security.\\nThis gets into things like access lists\\nwhere you can say we're going to create a access list\\nthat will allow this user but deny this user.\\nSo they're both on the same VLAN\\nbut one user has access the other doesn't.\\nusing an access list.\\nWorking through this scenario,\\nyou can say this entire network exists\\non physical network one.\\n\\nSo it's physical network one\\nand from a virtual perspective,\\nthere's virtual firewall context one or two, let's say one.\\nSo it's the same firewall hardware,\\nbut it's virtually segmented, VLAN 20,\\nso they're both on the same VLAN,\\nbut I can still implement controls\\nwith an access list using access list 100\\nthat has the policy,\\nallow this person and not allow this person.\\nBut what happens if you want it also go another layer down?\\nSo it's say you got this person and this person\\nand these two are allowed,\\nbut you want to sometimes allow this person\\nand other times not allow this person\\nand you just can't keep updating this access list\\n'cause this access list, if you did that would get\\nto the point of thousands\\nand hundreds of thousands of rules.\\n\\nSo you need a simpler way.\\nSo one way to do it, maybe going down\\nto the the packet layer, which is known as tagging.\\nSo you may say every time these users are creating,\\nso we'll go here again, you got my application,\\nI'm on VLAN 20, I got my access list doing things.\\nBut instead of like trying to do it all on an access list,\\nmaybe it's as packets are being created,\\nyou have each packet going\\nand then something is analyzed in the packets\\nand throughout this path you say, is this okay,\\nis this okay, is this okay?\\nNope, it's not okay and do it from a packet perspective.\\n\\nSo literally this is the user, this is the application.\\nEach hop, the packet is being analyzed\\nand that would be looking at the very bottom layer\\nof the segmentation\\nor what some people call microsegmentation,\\nwhich means you have the same physical network\\nand within the virtual environment,\\nthey're authorized to do all these things.\\nBut now at the packet layer, we're doing the analytics\\nand this idea can exist in a server environment.\\nImagine you have a server\\nand the server has an application that's running.\\n\\nMaybe there's physical components that secure it,\\nlike a physical firewall if you're the data center.\\nAnd then that data center server is going to live\\non a certain network.\\nSo we'll call this VLAN 10 or 20,\\nVLAN 20 for this is scenario\\nand then you got the user that's trying to access it\\nand you want to allow and not allow\\nand you may do all these things.\\nBut what if the actual application itself\\nneeds segmentation?\\nYou can still use the same kind of chart\\nand say physically, the data's allowed in.\\nThen you have a firewall\\nthat's running on the actual server or application.\\n\\nAnd then within there there are controls in place\\nto allow these things to talk.\\nSo we can be talking DevOps, DevSecOps\\nor just processes talking to processes,\\nthings being allowed to run\\nand maybe you have certain, call it access lists\\nor controls that would allow\\nand not allow these things to wastefully talk to each other.\\nSame would apply to a cloud environment.\\nWhether it's AWS, Azure, or Google,\\nyou're going to start up in an IAS environment,\\nI'm going to start up my system.\\nThat system is going to have some kind of network.\\n\\nBy default when you fire up a server,\\nthat system can't leave the network and get to the cloud.\\nThere's got to be, and usually by default,\\nthere are controls when it comes\\nto the network it plugs into.\\nAnd then how that network communicates to other networks\\nand how that network communicates to the internet,\\nwhich by default,\\nit's going to have different layers of segmentation.\\nSo segmentation essentially has many components to it\\nand there's many layers to this\\nand some may talk about microsegmentation\\nas being the end all way.\\n\\nLike you must always do this,\\nbut it just doesn't make sense at times.\\nIt doesn't scale.\\nThis is going to get into some of the essential concepts\\naround zero trust.\\nAnother category is host and server technologies.\\nAnd this gets into the idea of the actual endpoints,\\nwhether it's laptops, servers, phones, IOT devices.\\nWhat are the capabilities to secure those actual devices?\\nUnlike edge technologies that force traffic through it,\\nthis is ideally the technologies that exist\\nwith what's being protected and move along with that system.\\n\\nThe idea of these defenses, antivirus, anti-malware,\\net cetera, are constantly monitoring the processes\\nand all of that, that exist on that actual endpoint\\nwhere the VPN technologies,\\nthese kind of technologies are\\nlike protecting the communication\\nto and from that asset.\\nWhen I talk about anomalies or baselining,\\nthis is ideally the technologies\\nthat are creating that anomaly baseline monitoring\\nto look for unusual behavior.\\n\\nAlso from a XDR platform, you got your compliancy tools.\\nIs this system running in the most secure build?\\nIn my experience, this is one\\nof the biggest asks in the world\\nof security from organizations is\\norganizations want to run the most secure build\\nbecause they want to have least amount of vulnerabilities.\\nSo if they're going to run Windows,\\nthey make sure that Windows is always running patched up\\nto date in the most secure manner.\\nAnd this is where we get into GRC or government\\nand compliancy tools which are designed\\nto continuously monitor how things are being ran\\nand give recommendations to run the most secure build.\\n\\nSo all these things that I'm talking about really are\\naround the host and server world,\\nwhich is a whole nother category of security capabilities.\\nNext will be your cloud and data tools.\\nSo cloud being what's native.\\nSo if I'm running something in AWS or Azure\\nor Google, what do they offer within\\nthat cloud when it comes to the network\\nor the actual applications?\\nThis also gets into the actual data itself,\\nwhich data can have its own type of encryption.\\n\\nSo it could be data in motion,\\nwhich is basically encrypting the data,\\nseeing if the data has potential risk.\\nSo is it going to violate like PII\\nor other other things, does it have credit cards?\\nThose kind of things and also data at rest,\\nwhich is encrypting our hard drive,\\nencrypting the data itself.\\nSo imagine like a PDF file as encrypted.\\nSo if the attacker happens to compromise the system\\nand steal that file, when they go and open that file,\\nthey're going to have to have a login\\nor have to have some way to authenticate\\nso the data is still protected.\\n\\nAlso, data at rest means you can expire that access.\\nSo you can say nobody's able to access this.\\nSo it's basically unusable forever and it's data at rest.\\nSo all these things really come into this realm\\nof cloud and data security.\\nSame for things like SaaS, like Dropbox, Box, et cetera,\\nwhere you've outsourced everything.\\nThere are still typical capabilities that are offered\\nby that vendor or through APIs\\nor DevOps that allow you to leverage certain things\\nto have the ability to implement controls.\\n\\nAnd this gets into spaces like CSPM and CWWP\\nor CWPP, again the idea\\nof cloud-based security components,\\nwhich are all about accomplishing the similar goals\\nof other tools, which is how do I run the latest\\nor most secure build?\\nHow do I make sure least access\\nto things is occurring and so forth.\\nAlso, there's a section here in cloud around\\nwhat I would call resource resilience.\\nThis would be the idea\\nof protecting the availability of things.\\n\\nSo denial of service, distributed denial of service\\nor like web exploitation, cross-site scripting,\\nall these things that are designed\\nto potentially abuse something\\nand take its availability away.\\nAll this leads to more of a category\\naround cloud-based and database security.\\nAnother area to think about is identity security.\\nIdentity security is going to be trying to understand the who\\nand the what and make sure that the who\\nand what is authentic.\\n\\nSo like for example, I may say I'm Joey,\\nbut how do you actually know that?\\nThis gets into topics like multifactor authentication\\nwhere I have to do different things\\nto prove that I am me\\nand it's not that my identity has been compromised\\nand it's really an attacker posing as me,\\nbut this also can mean a program.\\nThink about like IOT devices or headless devices.\\nIf computer A wants to talk to computer B,\\nthere's got to be some way to identify that\\nand make sure that system is not an attacker system posing\\nas another system.\\n\\nSo all these concepts around like multifactor,\\nsingle sign on, the idea around certificates,\\nso certificates and websites, applications and authorizing\\nthat those are legit applications and processes.\\nAll that is really a combination of identity technologies.\\nFinally, you have the baseline, the intelligence,\\nthe research, the artificial intelligence, big data.\\nThose technologies all kind of get into the final concept\\nof this category of data and intelligence that's used\\nto enhance a security operation center's understanding\\nof threats.\\n\\nSo the idea really comes to like the anomaly realm\\nof the three capabilities I talked\\nabout earlier in the course where I'm looking at\\nwhat the world has to offer and taking that\\nand enhancing my XDR platform.\\nThis is also in my opinion, where cybersecurity is going\\nbecause as there's so much data out there,\\nlike if you go to the common security vendor\\nand say how does your tools work?\\nThey may throw out some ridiculous numbers.\\n\\nLike we block a million things a day\\nor a billion things a day.\\nGoogle will say we are a search engine\\nand we're blocking phishing attacks\\nin the cazillion billions.\\nIt's like humans can't deal with that.\\nThere's not a cazillion billion people there looking\\nand clicking and saying yes and no.\\nThere's automation, there's big data,\\nthere's machines doing this.\\nSo if you really think about this idea,\\nthis brings me to my concept of the future\\nwhere if it's big data attacks happening\\nand big data defense happening,\\nreally we're talking about machines versus machines.\\n\\nSo it's did I tune my machines\\nand is my automation better than yours?\\nSo really it's Bruce Schneider\\nand a lot of the visionaries in the cybersecurity world\\nhave published books on this\\nwhere literally it's like these movies, \\\"The Matrix\\\"\\nand stuff where it's machines versus machines\\nand that's where we're going.\\nAnd we've seen a lot of this in recent news\\nwith artificial intelligence where you have these ChatGPTs\\nand these tools that are automating things\\nlike people's writing people's thoughts.\\nSo instead of just creating something,\\nI go to ChatGPT and it creates it for me.\\n\\nIt's very interesting in the cybersecurity space\\nbecause think about like a security operation center,\\nan XDR, if my traditional approach is I go\\nto my XDR platform.\\nSo I say XDR platform, give me the data\\nand then I'll respond.\\nBut there's too much data to deal with.\\nSo I go to ChatGPT or I go to some AI tool\\nand say, do the same thing\\nand it can do it much more effective.\\nEssentially AI becomes my SOC and we're seeing this now.\\n\\nSo look at Microsoft.\\nMicrosoft has announced what they call Copilot.\\nCopilot is their artificial intelligence\\nand they have announced Copilot\\nfor their security platforms,\\nwhich is basically taking the data that's available\\nand then automating as much as possible\\nwhat an analyst would do\\nto basically review their XDR platform and give a response.\\nSo the scenario would be, Microsoft Copilot,\\ntell me what's going on in my environment\\nand from my machine AI perspective,\\nit is going to go and review all the security alerts.\\n\\nIt is going to give you a response\\nin a quick effective manner saying, based on all the events,\\nthis is what I'm seeing, this is the risk,\\nthis is what's happening,\\nthis is currently what you should do.\\nAnd then from there, make the SOC a lot more effective.\\nAnd Microsoft's not the only one doing this.\\nGoogle has Bard as their AI scenario\\nand they're announcing just like Microsoft,\\nBard integrated with their security tools.\\n\\nSo if you go their Chronicle, you go\\nto the security platform rather than expecting humans\\nto manually do things, I can go to AI\\nand AI will try to automate a lot of that research\\nand give a much effective answer.\\nSo keep an eye on this idea of AI, keep an eye on this idea\\nof artificial intelligence in regards to security\\nbecause this is the future.\\nAnd as we rely more and more machines,\\nthe future is going to be machines versus machines.\\nAnd lastly, this brings us back\\nto the reference architecture\\nthat you're going to see throughout this course,\\nwhich basically these categories\\nof technologies are going to relate back to these domains.\\n\\nSo there's going to be edge components,\\nthere's going to be monitoring components,\\nthere's going to be AI components around securing users\\nand securing endpoints, phones, et cetera.\\nThe same can be said though\\nfor a data center, there'll be antivirus, firewall,\\nbreach detection within the data center.\\nThe same is going to apply for data itself.\\nSo how do I protect the data?\\nHow do I, basically it's called data lifecycle management,\\nbut from the creation to the termination of such data,\\nhow do I enforce security?\\nSo essentially you can look at these products,\\nbut the recommendation would be is relate them back\\nto a reference architecture such as this\\nand say, when I buy that next gen firewall from whoever,\\nwhat are the check boxes?\\nFor example, the check boxes here may be it's going\\nto do the reputation security for my endpoints,\\nit's going to offer a VPN or encryption.\\n\\nIt's going to, maybe as assets are coming\\nthrough the network, it's going to do the profiling\\nand asset tracking, which also would apply\\nto my OT devices.\\nAlso, it's going to be the control point for my data center.\\nMaybe it has some web application layer\\nfirewall capabilities.\\nIt has the segmentation capabilities I need\\nand the firewall obviously,\\n'cause it's a next gen firewall,\\nit's going to maybe offer that VPN scenario here.\\nMaybe there's a scenario where it has the ability\\nto have some agent or API to control access to SaaS apps.\\n\\nMaybe it has some data classification components.\\nBut the idea is when I make that investment\\nfor that next gen firewall,\\nI can look at the different categories,\\napply those categories and capabilities to my architecture,\\nand then from there, in the end,\\nall of these data points would go back\\nto my XDR platform and more\\nor less provide value to my SOC.\\nThat is essentially how you should be looking\\nat capabilities, categories, and capabilities\\nand really understanding their value.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2022571\",\"duration\":279,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Security

Here we are again,\\nthe Joey's-best-practice-for-capabilities.\\nI highly recommend for you to leverage heat maps,\\nwhich is essentially what this is.\\nThis is, as a consultant, my go-to, my tool.\\nWhat I use when an organization comes to me\\nand says, \\\"Joey, help me be more secure.\\\"\\nYou don't have to use this particular heat map,\\nbut I highly recommend for you to use some form of heat map.\\nAnd what I mean by heat map is have a way to more\\nor less lay down the security capabilities that exist\\nand highlight where you have investments,\\nwhere there are gaps,\\nand where there's potentially areas of improvement.\\n\\nMaybe it's partially deployed, maybe it's deployed,\\nbut the SOC is not seeing the effectiveness\\nthey would like to see.\\nSo, to keep it simple, you could use a green, yellow,\\nred scenario where when I've done this,\\nsometimes organizations will want more diverse colors.\\nThey may say, \\\"Well, we can't have three\\nbecause yellow can represent two different things.\\nMaybe we need orange,\\nyellow represents it's not fully deployed\\nor orange represents it is fully deployed but not effective,\\nor green represents it is fully deployed\\nand it is effective.\\n\\nSo, however you want to do it,\\nfrom a heat map perspective,\\nmy recommendation is come up with a color scheme\\nor something you can use to kind\\nof understand where things are at.\\nSo a non-technical person, for this example here,\\ncan look at this and say,\\n\\\"All right, well I see in the world of data security\\nthat there is a lot of gaps here,\\nso that we can probably improve\\nor maybe do some investments there.\\nWhere in the SaaS world,\\nthere's also potentially a lot of gaps.\\nHowever, we see there's more investments in IoT\\nand in the Data Center.\\n\\nSo, this is areas that maybe\\nthat we don't have to look at as hard.\\\"\\nNow, to be clear, green doesn't always mean good\\nbecause maybe looking at the security operations center\\nto make this XDR platform work,\\nthere's 10 tools involved\\nand maybe it makes more sense to have two tools.\\nMaybe there's a lot of overlap and redundancy,\\nwhich is causing complexity in the sock.\\nSo just because it's green doesn't mean it's good.\\nGreen just means it's a different way\\nof potentially looking at improvements.\\nWhere red would mean there's a complete gap,\\nor yellow may mean maybe with this scenario of MDM,\\nthat it's good, but it's just not fully deployed.\\n\\nSo the key to this is understanding,\\n\\\"Well, this is a high level idea of what's going on.\\\"\\nSo then you can start to make plans,\\nbut you need some way to more\\nor less lay down a foundation\\nto have this security conversation\\naround where you should go.\\nBecause best practice is not to just rip\\nand replace everything.\\nBest practice is to understand what currently exists\\nand what you're trying to accomplish.\\nLast concept here with this heat mapping ideas,\\nred could exist because of whatever business reason,\\nbut it's not like you're going to have all green.\\n\\nAnd it's not like red really means something bad.\\nLet's say your organization doesn't really use SaaS,\\nthen you're going to have red over here\\nbecause you don't really use SaaS, and that's fine.\\nIn my experience, I've never found an organization\\nand I've met with every type of business\\naround the world pretty much.\\nNobody's going to have all green,\\nand sometimes there's going to be a lot of red,\\nbut at least with a heat map, this is the way for you just\\nto basically get the foundation to understand\\nwhere you're at and where you need to go.\\nAs I was stating, like, you don't have to use my heat map\\nand the scenario, like,\\nhere's another example of a heat map.\\n\\nIn this scenario, I have a user or a laptop.\\nThat laptop's going to have its capabilities\\nand then the laptop will connect to a network as an example,\\nand go through different layers of security\\nto end with a website or application.\\nAnd in this scenario, you could heat map that\\nand say, \\\"Well, these are the capabilities that exist.\\nThese are the ones that don't.\\nThese are the ones that are effective,\\nthese are the ones that are not.\\\"\\nThat's completely fine, as well.\\nAnd when it comes to what is good\\nand what is not,\\nyou can use many guidelines that are out there.\\n\\nMany, many publications or a lot of vendors\\nwill also offer their own version of this, as well.\\nHowever you do it, I highly recommend for you\\nas you kind of figure out where you're at\\nand where you want to go, to leverage heat maps.\\nIt's an extremely effective way\\nto take this complex idea of security\\nand get it to one place to understand where

Okay, we finally covered\\nall the foundation security concepts needed\\nto start the conversation around zero trust.\\nSo, what's zero trust?\\nWhen I ask that question, a lot of people will say,\\n\\\"Oh, we're talking least-privilege access.\\\"\\nSure, but really, what does that mean?\\nIf you think about it, what's being accessed?\\nIs it a application?\\nIs it a program talking to a program?\\nWho's doing the access?\\nHow do you control that access?\\nHow do you do least privilege?\\nSo, from a high level, this sounds correct,\\nleast-privilege access, sure.\\n\\nBut zero trust is a lot more than that.\\nThere's a lot of aspects to it,\\nand what we're going to cover in this course\\nis laying out a foundation\\nto truly understand zero trust end-to-end:\\napplication, to user, to headless device,\\nand everything in between.\\nIf we're going to define zero trust,\\nfirst we need to define the term trust.\\nWhat is trust?\\nbasically how do you understand what something is\\nand have trust in it?\\nAlso, you need to understand the difference\\nbetween what is considered trusted and not trusted.\\n\\nThis gets into ideas like:\\nHow do you allow an application to an application or DevOps?\\nHow do you authorize if something's running?\\nHow do you authorize applications to basically be online?\\nAnd then what, when it is online,\\nis allowed to connect to it?\\nTrust can get very hairy very quickly,\\nand this idea of trust led to the idea of zero trust\\nbecause traditional security\\nwas basically firewalls, perimeters, et cetera.\\nBut if it all comes down to data, which it's the CIA,\\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability,\\na part of that is establishing trust to data.\\n\\nSo, what happened is, in the security industry,\\nbasically this term trust started becoming a thing,\\nlike, \\\"We need to create guidelines.\\nWe need to create best practice around trust.\\\"\\nIt all started with the Jericho Forums,\\nwhere you have various professional security leaders\\ncoming together,\\nand more or less establishing a focus around trust,\\nwhich the Jericho Forums\\nwere later acquired by The Open Group\\nand led kind of the charge to this term zero trust.\\n\\nAs the term was being seen and used,\\nother major players, your Googles, your Microsofts,\\nyour NIST, your ISO, all these various groups,\\nstarted to create their own publications,\\ntheir own versions of zero trust.\\nAlso, as this journey was happening,\\nthe term started to be looked at and redefined\\nas the understanding of trust became more and more relevant.\\nSo, for example, trust in the beginning may be an access,\\nnetwork-access-focused,\\nbut as you get to the later versions of zero trust,\\ncloud, data, process started being brought into the play,\\nwhere they said, \\\"You know what?\\nThese definitions that were being established\\naround the 2014 place just doesn't make sense\\nin a modern world.\\n\\nWe need to reestablish, reupdate what this idea is.\\\"\\nSo, the term zero trust has been around\\nsince the early 2000s,\\nbut it's a journey that it continues to go and change\\nbased on how modern security needs to work.\\nIf you going to look at the Jericho Forum,\\nthere's really principles that are being laid out,\\nand these principles are the foundation\\nof all zero trust conversations.\\nThey may change as technology, and process,\\nand businesses change,\\nbut they still kind of maintain the same goals.\\n\\nSo, to go through these principles,\\nessentially what we're talking about\\nis first scoping out some level of protection.\\nSo basically, looking at this first one,\\nthere's got to be some kind of risk,\\nso we need some layer of protection.\\nThere's also the second one about being simple, scalable.\\nSo, whatever protection we have\\nneeds to be, more or less, effective and usable.\\nThis third one gets into the idea of assuming context.\\nSo, understanding the what something is\\nor who somebody is.\\n\\nBut basically, you could only take so much data\\nbefore you need to make a decision.\\nLike, you can't keep just asking,\\n\\\"Who are you? Who are you?\\\"\\nAt some point, you need to assume you have enough data\\nto make a decision around the context of a user or system.\\nThen, we get into things like using open systems.\\nSo, rather than using a closed platform\\nthat requires to buy these certain things\\nto be able to accommodate all the various capabilities\\nthat exist that are out there.\\n\\nYou have the idea of untrusted networks.\\nThis principle gets into the idea of working from anywhere.\\nNext, you get the principle around all people,\\nprocess, and technology.\\nSo, zero trust can't just be laptops and desktops.\\nIt's got to accommodate everything.\\nYou get into the idea of mutual trust.\\nSo the idea of various levels of trust and security\\nand how that applies across all devices,\\nall processes, all networks.\\nYou got the classic AAA,\\naccountability, authorization, authentication.\\n\\nMake sure that you truly understand\\nwho and what something is.\\nThe idea of access to data.\\nSo, how do you control that access?\\nThe idea of the data privacy,\\nso the confidentiality, the data integrity,\\nand then finally security being a default.\\nThere's a lot of principles.\\nAnd if you try to apply this, it can get really complex,\\nbut the idea is you need a foundation,\\nand the Jericho Forums, really with their principles,\\nset that foundation.\\n\\nWhat I'm going to do later throughout this course\\nis I'm going to take these Jericho principles,\\nas well as reference these within other guidelines,\\npublications from NIST, publications from The Open Group,\\nand look at how to turn these principles\\ninto actual action items you can take\\nto you, more or less, use zero trust as a guideline\\nto make you more secure.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2022570\",\"duration\":346,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Guidelines vs.

Earlier in this course, I talked about where people\\nand organizations go for best practice.\\nThis gets into the idea of policies, procedures, guidelines,\\nrequirements, compliancy, these kind of terms.\\nThe top three, policies, procedures,\\nand compliancy are requirements.\\nThey're all are required to do.\\nHowever, guidelines are recommendations,\\nthey're not required.\\nSo a policy would be, thou shall do this.\\n\\nThe requirement is all computers must be evaluated\\nfor risk, for example.\\nThe procedures are the tactical steps.\\nSo if the policy is, all computers should be evaluated,\\nthe procedures will be how the evaluation occurs.\\nWhen a computer connects, it is quarantined,\\nthese devices scan it, and this report is generated,\\nand these are the people that do that work.\\nSo policies, high level, procedures, very detailed.\\n\\nBoth have the same goal, both are required.\\nCompliance would be, you have to do this or we get fined.\\nSo we are required to do this.\\nThat's all, again, important things.\\nBut zero trust is not any of these.\\nNow, zero trust guidelines or recommendations\\ncan be converted into a policy and procedure,\\nwhich is very common.\\nBut essentially, if you look at\\na published zero trust paper, it is a guideline.\\n\\nIt is a best practice recommendation.\\nThere is no formal you have to do this.\\nHowever, a lot of requirements that are published,\\nthings from CMMC to NIST,\\nto things like your PCI DSS, HIPAAs,\\nlike we have to do this,\\nare based on publications around zero trust.\\nTo give you examples, NIST\\nand ISO publications are not requirements,\\nthey're guidelines.\\nBut as I mentioned, the HIPAA and the PCI DSS,\\nthose are not guidelines.\\n\\nThose are a compliancy requirements.\\nAnd imagine organization XYZ,\\nthey're going to create policies\\nand they may say, \\\"Well,\\nwith a policy with no reference.\\nI need some referenceable of why this is best practice.\\\"\\nSo, XYZ organization could go to a NIST publication,\\npull from what they want and call that their policy.\\nAnd then to execute it, they can go back to that guideline\\nand NIST will say, \\\"In order to do this best practice,\\nthis is what you do.\\\"\\nAnd then from there, the organization can write\\ntheir procedures around that publication.\\n\\nSo just to understand the language,\\npolicy, procedure, compliance and guidelines.\\nZero trust is a guideline.\\nAnd when people talk about it being required,\\nit's because it's being converted into a policy,\\na procedure, or some kind of compliancy.\\nListing out guidelines.\\nNIST would be a very popular one in the USA.\\nIt's also used internationally,\\nbut it is a United States USA-based publication.\\nVery popular ones would be the publication\\nfor security around the 800-53, the 800-171.\\n\\nBut NIST has all sorts of other publications\\nthat are not security related.\\nTo give an example of a compliance, CMMC,\\nor the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification,\\nis an example where the US government is saying,\\n\\\"We need to enforce NIST guidelines,\\\"\\nbecause again, a guideline is not required.\\nSo what is happening is, as time is going on,\\nthe US government is starting to publish new asks.\\nSo we're going to have this need to buy this product,\\nto buy this service.\\n\\nAnd in order to make sure security is involved\\nto make sure people are following NIST,\\nwe're going to require\\nthat there's a level of certification for CMMC.\\nSo if this organization wants to do this thing with us,\\nthey need to be Level 1, 2 or 3 CMMC certified.\\nCMMC is compliance.\\nYou have to do that and is 100% based on NIST 800-171.\\nSo that's an example of taking a guideline\\nand converting it into something\\nthat's compliant or required to do.\\n\\nNow, if you're not USA based\\nor you just want something that's more globally used,\\nISO is an example of another option for a guideline.\\nAnd an ISO could be converted into some kind of compliance\\nor policy if you so desire.\\nAlso, sometimes vendor guidelines.\\nSo these big vendors,\\nlike a Microsoft that has a lot of respect,\\nmay publish a best practice for zero trust\\nor XDR or whatever it may be.\\nAnd then from there,\\norganizations will adopt that as their policy.\\n\\nMaybe it's a consulting group, a Booz Allen,\\na Northrop Grumman publishing\\nwhat they feel is best practice\\nand they're claiming to be vendor neutral.\\nAnd therefore, it's something that could be used\\nfor a policy, procedure, or some kind of compliance.\\nFinally, there are tools that help with this,\\nwhich is your GRC, your governance, risk,\\nand compliance tools,\\nwhich a lot of the popular ones have built in references\\nto publications from NIST, from ISO,\\nor compliancy requirements.\\n\\nLike, you can buy a GRC tool and say,\\n\\\"Show me if I'm compliant or not to like a PCI DSS.\\\"\\nSo to help with this,\\nrather than expecting an organization to do it all manually.\\nThere are tools like the GRC tools to help in this space.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3965242\",\"duration\":187,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Zero Trust

Now let's look at what is zero trust best practice?\\nSo what are these principles trying to lead to?\\nWhat we'll do is we'll start with the original focus,\\nbecause as you're going to find,\\nthe term zero trust and what is best practice\\nis an ongoing moving target.\\nBut traditionally speaking,\\nif you were to take the open group publications,\\nthe big vendor publications and other guidelines\\nand look at how zero trust was first implemented,\\nit came down to three focus areas.\\n\\nFirst you have every concept\\naround eliminating network trust.\\nThis is the idea of starting\\nto do things like multifactor authentication,\\nso you don't just have like anybody can access anything,\\nbut have actually controlling the who and what can access\\nwhatever it's trying to access.\\nSecond, you get into the idea of segmentation,\\nwhich means I'm not only going to eliminate trust\\nwithin the network,\\nbut I'm also going to segment things.\\n\\nSo I'm going to have basically different things\\nin different pockets.\\nSo as I do multifactor authentication,\\nit's then accessing one part of the network.\\nBecause if you don't have segmentation,\\nyou can do multifactor\\nto make sure that so and so is able to access the network,\\nbut then they shouldn't have access,\\nlike everybody shouldn't be an admin.\\nI shouldn't have access to everything.\\nAnd then lastly,\\nthe third principle is not only enforce that multifactor,\\neliminate the network trust, not only have segmentation,\\nbut continuously monitor this stuff.\\n\\nNow if you break up everything down to these three things,\\nthis may sound like how you're running your security today.\\nThis may sound extremely effective,\\nbut there are challenges with this.\\nFirst, the idea of eliminating network trust\\nand multifactor.\\nIf you basically do multifactor authentication, that's good,\\nbut what happens\\nif the way that you're doing this is compromised?\\nWhat you don't want is a golden ticket.\\nSo think of like the example of the attack vector\\nwhere I steal an admin's credential\\nor I compromise a system that can access everything,\\nand then from there, I have the golden ticket to everything.\\n\\nSo there's got to be more.\\nYou got to basically do more than this,\\nbecause if you just have a one-time eliminate network trust\\nversus an ongoing process,\\nyou open up basically a big gap for an attacker\\nto take advantage of this lack\\nof in depth and ongoing trust\\nto more or less own your network\\nand own your data and own everything in between.\\nAnd when it comes to network segmentation,\\nwhat this comes down to is,\\nyes, you do need to do segmentation,\\nbut earlier in this course,\\nI covered the different types of segmentation,\\nand really there's a point where you can't segment anymore.\\n\\nLike there's no micro-micro-microsegmentation.\\nEventually you're getting into,\\nbasically, this is access to that.\\nSo it's like, think about for example, IoT.\\nIf I put an IoT device on the network,\\nwell, I have to connect it to the network,\\nso if I segment it from everything, I bury it in the ground,\\nyes, it's super secure,\\nbut it has access to absolutely nothing, so it has no value.\\nSo there is some point in my network segmentation strategy\\nthat I have to allow access.\\nand with IoT, if you just assume that,\\nokay, it's in a network segment, it's safe,\\nand attacker owns that, now they have a foothold.\\n\\nSo if you just assume the segmentation is working\\nand you're allowing this foothold, now all the attackers,\\nit's not about exploiting the network,\\nit's more about how do I pivot?\\nHow do I get out of this segment\\nand basically move to other segments\\nwhich is farther down a threat model\\nor farther down where the risk exists?\\nAnd then finally, this idea of monitoring\\ncomes down to what you're actually monitoring.\\nTraditional zero trust looked at XDR,\\nso you're basically just monitoring the SIM and the SOAR\\nor your XDR platform,\\nbut you're not monitoring every everything in between.\\n\\nSo what if we're talking SaaS?\\nWhat if we're talking data in motion?\\nWhat if we're talking about these other topics?\\nIf there's no way to actually see the security events\\nand actually understand what's happening,\\nthen you're blind.\\nSo really this continuous monitoring,\\neven though people will do a checkbox,\\nit was very limited when it came to the original tenants\\nof what's actually being monitored.\\nTo make this relevant,\\nI want to give you a few examples of how attackers,\\nor at least my research has shown\\nhow the original principles for zero trust\\nare just not effective.\\n\\nSo the first principle\\nis the idea of validating who or what something is,\\nand by having a traditional approach\\nof just doing multifactor authentication or one check,\\nhow that can fail.\\nBack in the 2013/14 timeframe,\\none of my best friends, Aamir Lakhani and myself,\\nspoke at RSA about our research\\nwhere we created Emily Williams.\\nEmily Williams is not a real person.\\nWe made her up.\\n\\nBasically we found a friend\\nthat at the time was was a hostess at a restaurant.\\nShe gave us some pictures.\\nWe explained to her what we were doing,\\nand basically created a fake IT professional.\\nWe gave Emily fake Social Security numbers.\\nWe created LinkedIn profiles, Facebook pages,\\nbasically created somebody out of thin air\\nand then started to apply\\nand eventually target an organization.\\nWe weren't the only researchers doing this.\\nThere was a Robin Sage research project\\nthat happened a couple years prior to ours\\nthat targeted the military\\nand more general information within the US government.\\n\\nOur research and what we published and showed at RSA\\nwas more targeted around,\\nI'm going to exploit this specific organization\\nby getting somebody hired\\nwithout actually having that person exist.\\nSo with Emily Williams, we made her,\\nif you really looked at the data,\\nwe made her like almost impossible to ignore.\\nWe gave her this ridiculous background\\neven though she was only 28 years old\\nand basically had her through LinkedIn\\nand through Facebook,\\ntarget people within a specific organization\\nand more or less have her become an employee,\\nhave her be announced at the new hire sales kickoff.\\n\\nWe were able to receive technology.\\nSo we were actually able to get the person in charge of IT\\nto mail us a laptop and basically onboard us\\neven though this person, again, does not exist.\\nHow we did this was we used social media.\\nSo for example, with LinkedIn,\\nwe started to basically get endorsements.\\nWe started to get people to be Emily's friend\\nand start to basically validate that Emily is a real person.\\nThen we started to target the organization\\nand specifically look at people's roles\\nand get them using social engineering\\nto do things to help us accomplish our goal.\\n\\nFor example, we found a person in charge of desktop support,\\nso distributing laptops and phones,\\nand we basically approached them on Facebook\\nwith a made up story, and the story is this.\\nWe found this person lived in Florida,\\nand we found that using Facebook\\nand using kind of their history on LinkedIn\\nthat they worked like 10 years ago at a pizza place.\\nSo this is like in their teenager days,\\nand this was like the first thing they referenced.\\n\\nSo we're like, interesting, 10 years ago, pizza place.\\nLet's see other people on that connection.\\nSo we clicked, we found the pizza place\\nbeing a Hungry Howie's,\\nand found there were other people\\nthat were basically associated.\\nSo what we did is we basically made up a story\\nwhere Emily Williams was the girlfriend\\nof a friend of the target we're trying to target.\\nSo basically came and said, \\\"Be our friend on Facebook.\\\"\\nThis person came back and said, \\\"Hey, do I know you?\\\"\\nAnd we're like, \\\"Yeah, do you remember Derek,\\\"\\nwho through Facebook connections, was friends of our target,\\nand we said, \\\"I'm Derek's girlfriend.\\n\\nYou don't remember me from years ago?\\\"\\nThink about this.\\nCan you really remember from 10 years ago,\\nwhen you're a teenager, if you're in your twenties,\\nfor example, or thirties,\\ncan you remember every friend you have, his girlfriend?\\nProbably not,\\nso basically started that communication, established trust,\\nbasically then talking about running into Derek,\\nwe saw Derek's current location from Facebook\\nis living in New York City,\\nand then the story is that Derek mentioned,\\n\\\"Oh, you're applying here.\\nGino so and so works here, so we're reaching out.\\\"\\nThe story is also very common where it's like,\\n\\\"Hey, we just left our employer,\\\" or, \\\"we just got hired,\\nand we have to wait two weeks\\nfor basically starting or officially onboarding,\\nso I'm kind of in limbo.\\n\\nI basically gave my two week notice\\nto where I currently work.\\nI'm waiting to start here,\\nbut could you potentially give me my laptop\\nor give me access now, because I'm hungry.\\nI want to get going to start working here.\\\"\\nAnd using that tactic,\\nwe're able to basically get this person to get us onboarded\\nwithout actually again being really authorized,\\nor fully, truly checked to see who we are.\\nWe're able to get a laptop.\\nWe're able to get access to certain resources.\\nSo we're not necessarily doing our traditional hacking,\\nwe're using phishing and social engineering to get access.\\n\\nThis tactic allowed us to more or less become an employee,\\nand if you want to learn more,\\nyou can search for the Emily Williams security talk,\\nor you can go to my blog, The Security Blogger,\\nwhere I've basically laid out all that research.\\nEmily Williams is a great example\\nof why this has to be done effectively,\\nbecause if not, and you trust an Emily Williams\\nand give Emily access to your resources,\\nall the security capabilities go away, because in the end,\\nyou're authorizing the attacker to have access.\\n\\nHow about these other ones, though?\\nHow about monitoring?\\nHow about showing me what could happen\\nif you don't have the right segmentation\\nor right security tools?\\nOne example of this is your traditional exploits,\\nand they may sound extremely complex,\\nbut they actually are not.\\nTo create an exploit or a backdoor is actually very easy.\\nThere are tools like Kali Linux\\nthat will allow you to run something like Metasploit,\\nor within seconds, you can create a backdoor.\\n\\nSo basically I run this quick script,\\ncreate a meta interpreter, and now I have a software.\\nIf I can get my victim to install this software,\\nI will have full access to that computer.\\nNow it's not as simple as, hey, install this software.\\nWell, actually sometimes it is,\\nbut sometimes you need to add some layers to your attack.\\nSo what I'm showing here is an example of a wrapper\\ncalled Sienna Spyware One,\\nwhere you can take something like a backdoor\\nand wrap it with something that is trusted.\\n\\nThis is actually a very common attack\\nthat started around the Napster days,\\nwhere you had all this free software,\\nfree music, free stuff,\\nand you're like, \\\"Awesome, this is free,\\\"\\nbut when you would run it,\\nit would not only run the free stuff,\\nit would also run a backdoor.\\nSo for example, I can take a backdoor,\\nin this example here, I'm taking the calculator\\nthat you would run on a Windows system\\nto open the calculator,\\nand wrap it together and call it calculator.exe.\\nWhen you run calculator.exe, the calculator's going to work,\\nit's going to be as if you ran calculator.exe,\\nbut it's also going to launch the rootkit.exe\\nand more or less launch the meta interpreter,\\nwhich will then alert the attacker,\\n\\\"We have a victim that's open for business,\\\"\\nand then from there, you can log in and access that system.\\n\\nThis fundamentally is how a lot of exploits\\nare created today,\\nand then the wrapper to all of this is creating the story\\nto get the victim to basically run that application.\\nLet's look at a real world example of creating an exploit,\\nwrapping it in a trusted software\\nand tricking a victim into installing it.\\nThis comes from a talk that my buddy Aamir Lakhani and I did\\nat at the DefCon conference a few years back.\\nFrom a warning perspective,\\nthis is probably not legal where you live.\\n\\nIt's not recommended to hack back,\\nbut this will give you a good concept understanding\\nof how these attacks could occur.\\nSo step one, if we're to use a threat model\\nor understand how this would start,\\nyou would need to create your backdoor.\\nSo in this use case here,\\nI'm using Metasploit to create a meta interpreter.\\nMy goal is to get the victim to run this on their system.\\nThis is an example of what it looks like\\nto create a meta interpreter, convert it to code,\\nso call this your payload, which then I need to inject\\ninto the tool that I'm going to send over to the victim.\\n\\nSo in this case, I'm going to weaponize a Word document.\\nThe story goes here\\nthat we found that there was an attack campaign\\nwhere the threat actors were pretending to work for Dell\\nand they were saying,\\n\\\"Customer, we have some alert through our intelligence\\nthat you were infected with malware,\\nand part of this built-in program or package that you own,\\nwe are calling you because we're seeing the hits\\nand we want to come in and help secure you at no cost.\\\"\\nWe heard about this campaign.\\n\\nWe built this environment to basically respond\\nand attack back against this campaign,\\nso when we got the phone call, we were super excited.\\nIn the use case here,\\nwe social engineered with the attackers\\nand basically they were convinced that we're a proper victim\\nand were offering their service\\nand gave us a document more or less for us to sign off on\\nbefore they were going to then log in our computer\\nand save the day,\\nbut reality is, they're probably going to install ransomware.\\n\\nSo the idea is, is what if we take this document\\nand wrap in the back door?\\nSo typically you would hide this,\\nbut just for the sake of understanding,\\nhere is taking the meta interpreter code\\nand more or less embedding it into the Word document.\\nAgain, obviously we wouldn't make this easy\\nto see like this,\\nof how you can take something like a Word document\\nand add malicious code, so when you open the Word document,\\nit also launches that code.\\n\\nOnce we have our payload,\\nthe idea is now we're going to send over this document.\\nSo the attacker sent us the document,\\nwe hypothetically filled it out,\\nand now we're sending it back,\\nand with the meta interpreter running,\\nwe're waiting to see if they actually open the document\\nand also launch the back door.\\nSo this becomes a waiting game.\\nWe're basically,\\nwe're waiting, we're waiting, we're waiting,\\nand the meta interpreter is waiting to see a callback\\nsaying a victim has more or less\\nopened and installed this software,\\nand you have the ability now to log in that system.\\n\\nAs we're sitting on the phone with the attackers,\\nwe eventually got notification\\nthat they opened the Word document,\\nand more or less, it let us know,\\nhey, at this point you can log into their system.\\nWith that, as I'm talking to the, in this case, the victim,\\nbut it's the attacker trying to attack me,\\nI'm now able to log into that person's computer\\nand more or less have control of that computer.\\nFrom there, I can start running commands\\nto see what's installed on that computer,\\nlike what data is there, and more or less,\\nI can act as if I am the the administrator of that computer.\\n\\nTo keep it fun, we started to look around what's there,\\nstart dumping data, more or less start pivoting around,\\nand then eventually I wanted to see the desktop.\\nSo here I'm running VNC,\\nwhich allows me to virtually look at the desktop.\\nThe same way the victim is seeing the data in here,\\nI can see the person's looking at the document.\\nNow what's funny is we were so excited\\nabout getting this attacker to actually run the document\\nthat I forgot to actually fill out the document,\\nlike I just wrapped it with a backdoor and sent it to them.\\n\\nSo right at this point,\\nI'm having a conversation with the victim,\\nor this case, this attacker, saying,\\n\\\"Oh, I'm sorry, I sent you the wrong documents,\\\"\\nbut really it doesn't matter at this point.\\nIt's already game over.\\nThey've already installed my backdoor\\nand I already have access to their system.\\nThen at this point, the thought was,\\nwell, what else can I do?\\nMaybe I can also turn on video.\\nMaybe I can also deploy my own malicious software\\nand at this point I have to shut off the video,\\nbut basically due to legal reasons, et cetera,\\nwhat happened at this point\\nis we were able to turn on the camera\\nand able to actually see who the attacker is.\\n\\nWe found there was actually a data center,\\nso looking over the shoulder of the attacker,\\nwe can see there was other people\\nthat are part of this whole scam,\\nand from there we're able to,\\nand you can see the talk from DefCon,\\nlaunch your own malware\\nand do other nasty things in magic land.\\nAgain, nothing here is authorized\\nor recommended for you to do,\\nbut the idea is we're able to take a harmless document,\\nwrap a backdoor, turn that into a weapon,\\ntrick the victim into opening that document,\\nand also, without knowing,\\ninstalling our backdoor software,\\nleading to basically the compromise of that system.\\n\\nThis scenario,\\nthe attackers didn't have breach defense capabilities,\\nso they weren't doing threat modeling like they should be,\\nso once we had access to one system\\nand we're on the network,\\nwe had access to all the systems.\\nNow you may be thinking,\\n\\\"Oh, well you've obviously taken these people down.\\\"\\nNo, basically even with the stuff that we did in magic land,\\nthey were back up and running within a few days,\\nand if anything,\\nwe taught them a lesson how to be more secure.\\nAnd even if we were able to take them down\\nand completely remove them,\\nall we would do is open the void\\nfor somebody else to step in\\nand then take over that business\\nand launch the same attacks.\\n\\nSo definitely we're not recommending for you to be Batman\\nand hack back and do these things.\\nBest practice is always going to be\\nabout reducing the success rate of such attacks,\\nso the attackers don't find value in doing it\\nand they move on to do other things.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3963531\",\"duration\":432,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Current Zero Trust

Now, it's time to look at:\\nWhat is the current best practice,\\ncurrent principles around zero trust?\\nThis gets into the idea of modern security,\\nmodern ways to look at identity,\\nmodern ways to look at segmentation and monitoring.\\nSo first, you have basically what I would say\\nare factors that have basically changed\\nhow zero trust is being viewed.\\nFirst off, you got the user experience and simplification\\nof things like multifactor authentication.\\n\\nMultifactor authentication is fine.\\nSo, something you have, something you know,\\nor something you are,\\nbut you can't just keep authenticating the user\\nbecause it becomes cumbersome, it becomes annoying.\\nI remember actually a few weeks ago,\\nI was talking to somebody,\\nand they were trying to find something and they're like,\\n\\\"Why do I have to keep logging into this system?\\\"\\nAnd just out of frustration,\\nthey were looking for a way to not log in anymore.\\nThey're like, \\\"Maybe we should just try something else.\\nLet's just put it up on Dropbox or something.\\\"\\nBecause it's just...\\nIts security is reducing the ability to do their job.\\n\\nAlso, like onboarding, offboarding, working from anywhere,\\nthese are other concepts that really have changed\\nor required adjustments to the way we look at zero trust.\\nThe idea of telemetry, where you're getting data from.\\nEven now, with things like artificial intelligence,\\nall of this has got to be put into the bucket\\nand considered as we start to come up\\nwith what is considered zero trust best practice.\\nThere's also the idea of: What is the digital estate?\\nTraditional networks, and I showed this earlier,\\nyou had this drawbridge\\nand you had this perimeter-based security,\\nbut looking at the list here,\\nthe digital estate has changed.\\n\\nThere's not only IoT,\\nbut there's cloud, virtual, and everything in between,\\nwhich brings new vulnerabilities\\nand new things to think about.\\nSo these also have forced changes\\nto how zero trust is being defined.\\nOther things to think about is the integration\\nand verification of controls.\\nSo, you can have a tool,\\nbut how does that tool\\nleverage the overall zero trust policy?\\nThe traditional way that's been done\\nis you create your security for the cloud,\\nthen you create policies and security for the network.\\n\\nThen, you create security and policies for the endpoint,\\nand they're all kind of separate.\\nThey have the same goals, but they're all separate.\\nThis has got to change.\\nAnd when it comes to modern zero trust, it's:\\nHow do I collapse all these areas?\\nSo, instead of having different points of truth\\nor different tools to different policies\\nthat are trying to accomplish the same thing\\ndone different ways,\\nyou basically break down the barriers\\nand have one zero trust strategy.\\nFor example, if you're going to do the authentication\\nof me versus a machine,\\naccessing a resource on-prem versus the cloud,\\nhow do you do that?\\nHow do you have one solution,\\nwhich there is no vendor that does it all,\\nbut you need a platform and you need a zero trust strategy\\nthat can cover everything across the board.\\n\\nSo, these recent changes of technology,\\nof adoption of cloud,\\nbasically break the old zero trust models.\\nThen, you have the idea,\\nif you think about the third\\ntraditional principle of monitoring,\\nwhat does that really mean?\\nThis again, to me,\\ncomes to the idea of garbage in, garbage out.\\nIf you're only monitoring a certain aspect of events,\\nthen you're blind to everything else.\\nAnd essentially, you're not doing the best you can do\\nwhen it comes to security.\\nSo I want to have strong posture, strong governance,\\nto make sure that you're monitoring everything,\\nand then more importantly, enforcing.\\n\\nAnd this gets into the idea of:\\nAre you running the most secure build?\\nSo if I'm going to stand up a server, is it already patch?\\nIs it running the best security it can run?\\nThat's also got to be part of zero trust.\\nVulnerability management is critical.\\nLike, yeah, you can build barriers around things,\\nbut you need a vulnerability\\nin order to have something to exploit as an attacker.\\nSo, less vulnerabilities, less targets,\\nhence the reduction of risk when it comes to security.\\nSo, as things like security posture, governance,\\nthese things are coming out,\\nthese have to be taken in consideration\\nas we define what is zero trust.\\n\\nFinally, you get this idea of automation versus training.\\nIn the past, traditional security\\nwould say it's all about people,\\nsecuring people, training people,\\ngetting them to basically reduce their risky activity.\\nBut the reality of it is people are people.\\nPeople are human.\\nThere's a natural-built trust.\\nFor example, when it comes to phishing attacks,\\nI've worked at Cisco for 10 years.\\nI recall every year\\nthey would watch the same phishing campaign\\naround Christmas.\\n\\nThey would say \\\"UPSS, or some variation of UPS,\\nhas shipped you a package,\\nand the address is wrong or something like of that nature.\\nClick here to validate this package.\\\"\\nAnd the success rate of clicking that\\nwas always 40% or so or higher.\\nRegardless if it's been done every year,\\nand like a lot of people know it's coming,\\njust naturally thinking about humans,\\nlike it's Christmas time.\\nIf you celebrate that holiday,\\nyou're probably having your family and others buy things,\\nship things,\\nand it's very likely that something may get shipped\\nand you didn't know about that.\\n\\nSo you may naturally, as a reaction,\\njust click that to see what it's all about.\\nAnd if you click it, game over.\\nSo this idea of training people has more shifted to:\\nWell, how do we remove this high risk,\\n'cause people are the weakest link,\\nhow do I remove that from the factor\\nof how we're doing security?\\nAnd this gets into automation.\\nSo, rather than training somebody to not click that,\\nwhy don't we stop the clicking from occurring?\\nOr if they do click it,\\nreduce the risk of that click leading to an attack.\\n\\nFor example, rather than trying to train them to understand\\nthat that UPS link is fake,\\ninstead let's look at the link itself\\nand not even allow it if it's a threat.\\nSo one example would be reputation security.\\nSo, if it's UPSS coming from a resource\\nthat's been online for $2 hosted from GoDaddy,\\nthat's probably not really UPS.\\nUPS has been around for a while.\\nThere's probably ways to validate its actual risk.\\nSo, by basically saying, \\\"Oh, this link is is not real,\\\"\\nthat email, or that text message, or whatever it may be,\\nwhen you click it, will then deny that user,\\neven though they're trying to go there,\\nit will deny them going there.\\n\\nSo that's the idea of starting to leverage automation\\nversus just user training,\\nwhich is really taking an impact\\nto how people are creating guidelines such as zero

So you're probably thinking, Joey,\\nwhat is the current definition of zero trust?\\nWell, if you look at the current guidelines,\\nor if you Google search to find zero trust,\\nyou're probably going to come up\\nwith some definition like this.\\nZero trust is a security model that assumes\\nevery user device and network is basically untrusted.\\nSo it doesn't matter who or what it is,\\nit is, what's key, untrusted,\\neven if it originates from inside the network perimeter,\\nmeaning you can work from anywhere,\\nor that device can be anywhere.\\n\\nIf you break down how this definition is created,\\nso all the principles behind it, essentially,\\nI find with every guideline out there,\\nthere's four areas to look at.\\nFirst, there's the idea of continuous authentication.\\nThis would be going beyond the original principle\\nof just logging in or having a multi-factor happen one time,\\nbut make sure it's continuous, you're always doing it.\\nThen there's the concepts\\naround least privilege access as well as segmentation,\\nwhich we'll talk about in a second,\\nhow they work together.\\n\\nAnd then finally there's the monitoring aspect,\\nwhich instead of you just monitoring,\\nyou're actually assuming breach.\\nLooking at these key principles, part one,\\nalways applying explicitly\\nor always verifying explicitly comes down\\nto making sure you trust who or what it is.\\nSo you're validating what that thing is.\\nHow principle two and three come together is,\\nonce you establish trust,\\nthere's got to be a way of controlling access.\\nSo first there's the policy.\\n\\nSo if this thing or this person is authorized, allow it.\\nAnd then once they're authorized,\\nonly allowing access to whatever it should be.\\nSo dynamically creating that zero trust segmentation.\\nAnd this should be continuous by the way,\\nlike I log in,\\nand I am authorized to resource one,\\nand it's segmented around resource one.\\nThen I log in, and I have access to resource two.\\nNow I only have access to resource two,\\nbut to go back to resource one,\\nI have to start the process over again.\\n\\nAnd then lastly, in a lot of the guidelines\\nthey're talking about with monitoring,\\nreally the monitoring language\\nis also talking about assuming breach.\\nSo rather than monitor this and monitor that,\\nlet's assume that this situation\\nis going to break down at some point.\\nSo by using a holistic view called XDR platform,\\nI'm always looking for a breach.\\nDouble click into all four of these principles,\\nalways verifying explicitly really comes down to,\\nin my mind, the idea of context.\\n\\nContext is basically all the data points\\nyou're using to verify who or what something is.\\nThink about if I'm going to remotely connect\\nto a server and access that resource.\\nYou want to not only have me do my multifactor authentication\\nand make sure that this is Joey,\\nbut you may also look at this computer.\\nIs this a corporate-issued computer or not?\\nMaybe you can use a MAC address,\\nmaybe there's hidden certificates,\\nhowever you want to do it.\\n\\nAlso, you also want to think about,\\nwell, Joey is a worker, lives in the USA,\\nin the Washington DC area.\\nSo why is this happening at 3:00 AM?\\nSo maybe the point in time may make sense.\\nAlso if I'm traveling or not.\\nLike, why is Joey coming from China?\\nWe don't have any records\\nof Joey having to be in China right now.\\nSo all these various factors are context,\\nand the idea is to always verify.\\nSo you don't do it one time,\\nbut every time access is happening,\\ngo back and check all these points,\\nbecause traditional ways of doing this\\nwould do something like a network access control\\nand validate one time.\\n\\nBut once you say, oh, that's Joey,\\nthen you would do single sign-on and say,\\nJoey, now we trust him for 24 hours.\\nAnd then Joey can keep accessing resources\\nwithout validating all this.\\nAnd that's where the breakdown happens\\nbetween traditional zero trust\\nversus current zero trust principles.\\nNext, you've got the segmentation component,\\nwhich traditionally would be, all right,\\nlet's create VLANs and ACLs,\\nor create basically these barriers,\\nand then from there allow whatever\\nto connect to the barrier.\\n\\nWhere current zero trust models are dynamic,\\nmeaning as a user or device is authorized,\\nthen we're going to create a new network segment\\nor basically limit this to least privilege access.\\nSo the idea is, when Joey access resource one,\\nthere should be a dynamic segmentation created.\\nAnd then when I access resource two and three,\\ndifferent dynamic segmentations are created.\\nAnd this is based on dynamic policies.\\n\\nSo when Joey wants to access,\\nso here I am and I want to access this resource,\\nthere needs to be a policy in place that basically says,\\nwho are you?\\nOkay, you're trusted.\\nNow based on your current trust,\\nhere's what you can and can't access.\\nThis kind of falls in line with that segmentation idea\\nwhere this is creating that segmentation\\nfor each access that's happening.\\nSo when I access resource one,\\nthe dynamic segmentation is there and the policy is there.\\nThis in theory sounds easy,\\nbut it can get extremely complex\\nas you've got various users, devices,\\ndata living in the cloud, on-prem, et cetera.\\n\\nSo the idea is using least privilege,\\nbut also being able to adapt and be just in time.\\nSo as this is happening,\\nthis policy is able to be\\non just-in-time enforcement policy.\\nAnd then lastly is the idea\\nof monitoring and assuming breach.\\nSo topics like user behavior analytics.\\nThese are all topics that come into, well,\\nlet's look at how trust is basically being deployed\\nand how the segmentation is happening,\\nhow these things are happening,\\nand create things like baselines and saying,\\nif we see anomalies happening,\\nthose potentially can be threats\\nor be a breakdown of security.\\n\\nFor example,\\nif we're always allowing people to log in things,\\nbut then you see one login credential\\nis starting to do port scanning\\nor starting to access other things\\nthat's typically not done,\\nmaybe it's okay, maybe it's not,\\nbut we need to assume breach.\\nSo we're not just looking at traditional monitoring,\\nlet's look at my XDR platform\\nand just monitor some security tools.\\nIt's look at the policies,\\nlook at how users are being verified,\\nand then from there, apply security against that.\\nThese are essentially the four major ingredients\\nor principles around modern zero trust.\\n\\nAnd you're going to find every major guideline,\\nwhether it's from a publication of NIST, ISO,\\nor whoever is going to have these elements in that publication.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Lesson 4: Zero Trust

All right, now that we've defined zero trust,\\nwe have our modern principles covered.\\nLet's look at a few popular guidelines.\\nWe'll start with a review of The Open Group,\\nwhich are the ones that acquired the Jericho Forums.\\nAccording to The Open Group,\\nzero trust is defined as an information security approach\\nthat focuses on data/information security,\\nincluding lifecycle, on any platform or network.\\nWhat they're saying is, is pretty much,\\nif you were to boil it down, let's be prepared for anything.\\n\\nLet's be prepared for success,\\nlet's be prepared for failure.\\nHowever, there are more principles\\nthat are laid out behind this definition.\\nSo just like the zero trust principles\\nwe covered in an earlier lesson,\\nThe Open Group has their own principles\\nthat they call the Zero Trust Commandments,\\nand you're going to find they're going to be very similar\\nto the Jericho principles\\nbecause these are, more or less,\\nupdated versions of the Jericho principles.\\n\\nAccording to The Open Group,\\nif you're to go through the principles,\\nfirst, it starts with validating explicit trust.\\nThis probably sounds familiar\\nbecause this is pretty much what we talked about\\nin our general core zero trust modern principles.\\nThis, essentially,\\nis that context concept we talked about earlier.\\nIt also talks about enabling modern work.\\nEnabling modern work\\nis essentially being able to not only be secure,\\nbut also be modern, allow productivity.\\n\\nThis gets into the idea\\nof not only doing things like multifactor authentication\\nbut not being disruptive.\\nIt talks about having persuasive security.\\nSo basically talking about not only being modern,\\nbut also being integrated.\\nSo really these two are all about having effective security,\\nsomething that works with the organization.\\nThe next one talks about the asset value.\\nSo not only are we protecting things,\\nand this is actually a core security concept in general,\\nis we should focus on the most important assets.\\n\\nSo this is, they actually are talking\\nabout also being able to weigh the value of an asset.\\nThis actually...\\nAny vulnerability management program does this as well.\\nNext, you have implementing a asset-centric controls.\\nSo it's focusing on basically various types of controls.\\nThis allowed to accommodate things like IoT devices,\\npersonal laptops versus corporate laptops.\\nThey have concepts about simplicity.\\nThey have your traditional least privilege access,\\nwhich again, that one, as well as explicity,\\nare both ones that we've called out\\nin our fundamental zero trust principles.\\n\\nImprove continuously,\\nand then finally, make an informative decisions,\\nwhich basically is the idea\\nthat you can only take in so much data\\nbefore you make a decision.\\nSo essentially, if you were to look at these principles,\\nyou're going to find overlap.\\nThis is, in my opinion, the overlap.\\nThese again, being almost,\\nand this talking about kind of the same thing.\\nThese talking about being asset-focused\\nor focusing on assets.\\nYou got your traditional least privilege,\\nthese are the ones that are in our core definition.\\n\\nAnd then you got more improvements\\nand making informative decisions.\\nSo, that is essential what The Open Group is talking about\\nwhen it comes to building a zero trust foundation.\\nThey're, more or less,\\njust like the Jericho Forums\\nlaying out a bunch of like requirements.\\nFinally, there's some added Zero Trust Commandments.\\nThere's some additional ones\\nthat have kind of followed that original list,\\nand some of the newer ones talk about telemetry\\nand assuming breach.\\nAssuming breach comes straight\\nfrom our four fundamental zero trust principles.\\n\\nBut telemetry is actually a foundation of this\\nbecause if you're going to be doing a behavior monitoring,\\nlike a UEBA, which is the user behavior monitoring,\\nor let's say a telemetry monitoring,\\nsomething like with a net flow, these tools are needed.\\nSo telemetry is more or less needed to create that baseline,\\nso you can basically identify a anomaly.\\nSo, the telemetry piece\\nis really a subset of assuming breach.\\nProtecting data has always been the focus of cybersecurity.\\n\\nWe talked about the CIA in our lesson,\\nenabling secure access in a layered approach.\\nThis is just fundamental stuff.\\nThis is the defense in depth concepts.\\nSo, there you go.\\nThese are the ingredients\\nthat make up The Open Group's zero trust guidelines.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3965239\",\"duration\":232,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Architecture

Now that we've covered the Open Group principles\\nfor Zero Trust,\\nlet's look at the Open Group Zero Trust architecture.\\nThis architecture is pretty simple to understand.\\nFirst, you have your users, assets,\\napplications, something trying to connect to something else.\\nThat something else could be data, applications,\\nparts of the network, et cetera.\\nWithout Zero Trust,\\nyou would basically have these resources connecting\\nto these resources,\\nor these users connected to these resources.\\n\\nHowever, according to the Open Group Zero Trust model,\\nthere is a policy enforcement point\\nthat essentially is, think of it like a security bottleneck\\nthat is forcing the users, assets, et cetera,\\nto be validated, and then from there,\\nthis policy enforcement point\\nwill allow a one-time session to whatever asset\\nor application that's trying to be connected.\\nWhen that user or application\\nor asset wants to connect again, it's then got to go\\nthrough the same security policy enforcement engine\\nbefore another session is allowed to that one asset,\\nrather than giving a VPN or some one-time connection,\\nand then having basically the golden ticket\\nto all the assets.\\n\\nThis access control point makes up a ton\\nof security technology.\\nThis could be things like your identity security tools,\\nmultifactor authentication tools,\\neverything to validate something like,\\nis this Joey, for example?\\nThis can make up your endpoint security tools,\\nlike that's Joey's laptop, or phone, or something like that.\\nThis can make up all of your tools regarding risk.\\nSo risk could be a bunch of things like,\\nis the latest antivirus running with the updates,\\nor is the system or application patched,\\nor whatever it may be, is this device a low risk?\\nOther things that could be considered, things like time,\\nwhy is it 3:00 AM?\\nJoey doesn't work at 3:00 AM,\\nor what about location?\\nEssentially what we're talking about here,\\nall this is that idea around context.\\n\\nContext, again, is trying to learn as much\\nas possible about these things\\nto then make a formative decision to allow\\nor not allow the connection.\\nPart of context is the threat intelligence.\\nSo the threat intelligence is feeding these security tools\\nto give a latest update of what's happening\\nin the basically cyber landscape.\\nNow, outside of this access control engine,\\nyou have the security operation center.\\nSo your SOC is basically the ones\\nthat are monitoring for breaches,\\nmonitoring all these tools.\\n\\nOutside of your SOC, you have your GRC,\\nyour governance tools.\\nNow governance is not only about making sure\\nthat you're meeting security requirements,\\nthere's also things like automation.\\nWe talked about in an earlier lesson,\\nhow the modern security architectures are trying to automate\\nas much as possible, so rather training users\\nto not click something.\\nWhen they do click something, automate the response.\\nThis also gets into the concepts like the SOAR, XDR,\\nwhere you're try to be more effective with your playbooks.\\n\\nAnd then finally, there's the asset protections,\\nall the security tools, data security tools, et cetera,\\nthat are being monitored by the SOC to make sure\\nthat these assets themself aren't being attacked.\\nThis essentially is the open group's high level view\\nof what a Zero Trust architecture should look like.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3959590\",\"duration\":475,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Capability heat

All right, at this point,\\nwe've covered The Open Group principles\\nand The Open Group architecture, which is great,\\nbut you're probably wondering how does this actually apply\\nto creating a zero trust architecture that you can use?\\nLike how do you actually benefit from this guideline?\\nEssentially, the guideline is talking about end users,\\ndevices, et cetera, going through a access control point\\nthat, based on context and other factors,\\nwill either allow or deny,\\nand if it allows,\\nwill allow a one time session to your assets.\\n\\nYou got a security operation center,\\nyou got your governance,\\nand then lastly, your endpoint security products.\\nYou got your data security products.\\nThese other things that protects this digital estate.\\nIf you were to boil this down, though,\\nto a heat map, capabilities, things that you want to use\\nto build your own zero trust architecture,\\nbasically, you would first look at what's being called out,\\nwhich the first component that's being called out\\nis your host security tools.\\n\\nThis is going to be basically things like your EDRs,\\nfor example, or with an EDR\\nthat can be installed on your laptops, desktops, et cetera,\\nbut this also could be installed on your servers\\nand inside your data center.\\nYou got your endpoint management tools\\nand server management tools.\\nThings like you're making sure\\nthat you're running the latest builds,\\nmaking sure when a server is lit up,\\nthat server has the latest patches,\\nso you don't have a rogue risk, high risk\\nof assets being ran inside the data center.\\n\\nWe cover the idea of security tools\\nfor hosts, and servers, and clouds,\\nbut all those various types of tools,\\nmonitoring tools would exist here.\\nNext, in this access control component,\\nis going to be your identity management architecture.\\nSo this will be your multifactor authentication.\\nThis will be where you store identities.\\nMaybe you have active directory, or LDAP, or something.\\nMaybe it's on-prem, maybe it's in the cloud.\\nMicrosoft would probably recommend for you to go\\nto the cloud, because you can do things\\nlike the facial recognition\\nor Microsoft Hello as an example,\\nbut basically, that identity management estate would live\\nat this point of the architecture.\\n\\nOther pieces are going to be your policy enforcement engine.\\nNow, this is interesting,\\nbecause there are a couple ways to do this,\\nand I'm going to talk about this in a future lesson\\nregarding how to enforce zero trust policy.\\nBut essentially, you can either have an agent\\non the asset, the endpoint, et cetera\\nthat is basically checking things and enforcing traffic.\\nThat's one option you can do.\\nYou can have a central network points,\\nwhich, traditionally, has been the stack\\nof security products, but the modern way of doing it\\nis moving this to the cloud.\\n\\nAnd the reason why is,\\nif user A is in China, user B is in Australia,\\nuser D is in America, rather than having all of them have\\nto come back to the USA,\\nif that's where the organization's at,\\ntheir security policy enforcement point is close to them.\\nIt's basically in the cloud and always available.\\nThis is known as Secure Access Service Edge, or SASE,\\nwhich is a topic we covered earlier in this course.\\nBut that's another way of doing it.\\n\\nOr a third way that do this access control point\\npotentially is, just putting it right at the application\\nor at the edge of where you're trying to access.\\nSo this can be, for example, you have a contractor\\nthat's at Starbucks or somewhere in the world,\\nthey try to access the application\\nand upon that connection, then this access control point\\nis checking context, doing its piece\\nbefore it actually allows access.\\nSo, just because the zero trust architecture\\nfrom The Open Group is showing it in the middle\\ndoesn't mean that this can be here.\\n\\nIt can be somewhere in the middle\\nvia like a cloud, SASE, SSE type approach,\\nor it can be at the edge of where you're trying to access.\\nBut there has to be a component there.\\nAnd, again, we'll talk about this in a later architecture\\nwhere we'll see these three different architectures in play.\\nAlso, notice we have this concept of DevOps.\\nDevOps is making things work with things.\\nThis takes into consideration the idea of an application\\ntrying to talk to an application,\\nwhich DevOps happens over APIs.\\n\\nAnd there are DevOps security options\\nthat are out there known as DevSecOps.\\nOne popular way of doing it would be maybe using\\nan API gateway.\\nSo an API gateway.\\nBasically, the idea is, this gateway exists\\nwhen there is a DevOp request,\\nit's got to go through the API gateway,\\nwhich that's kind of sanitized,\\nand made sure that there's no high risk requests\\nand other things happening\\nas the the API communication is either allowed or denied.\\n\\nNext, you get into the area of assets being protected,\\nwhich ideally is going to be segmented.\\nAnd this gets into the idea of segmentation,\\nmicro-segmentation or in a zero trust estate,\\nyou're only being provided the one-time access\\nto the specific thing,\\nbut just because you're being provided,\\nthat doesn't mean that these assets themself\\nwill not be segmented.\\nLooking back at our core principles,\\ndynamic segmentation is needed\\nalong with that one-time access\\nor the least privileged access.\\nSo your segmentation components, whether cloud, or virtual,\\nor physical, or network-based must exist as well.\\n\\nAnd then finally, we move over\\nto the security operation center.\\nAnd these tools are going to be basically the XDR concepts\\nthat we covered in early lessons,\\nor maybe you go the EDR or XDR, however you get there.\\nYour monitoring platforms,\\nas well as some of the other components,\\nlike your UBA, user behavior analytics.\\nBasically, your ability to monitor for breach.\\nAnd as we mentioned with the government's risk\\nand compliance,\\nand there are tools like RSA Archer, for example,\\nwhich makes sure that compliancy is met,\\nmake sure that efficiency is met.\\n\\nAnd then on top of that, that can leverage the XDR platform\\nto do the SOAR components.\\nThe automation components as well.\\nSo by looking at this Open Group architecture,\\nnot only is this high-level concept make sense,\\nbut from a capabilities perspective,\\nthere are tools being called out\\nthat you could essentially create a heat map of.\\nSo going back to Joey's heat map,\\nand more or less see if you have what's needed\\nto develop a modern zero trust architecture\\nas well as see what maybe needs\\nto be either purchased or upgraded.\\n\\nSo the host security tools, those are covered over here.\\nYour SOC security tools are covered up here.\\nWhen it comes to the identity tools,\\nthere is the identity management tools,\\nthe secure privilege access, the endpoint management tools.\\nThe policy enforcement, by the way,\\nis also your secure privilege access tools.\\nYour identity protection tools are there.\\nWhen it comes to your GRC tools,\\nthat's going to exist in the security operation center.\\nSo your SOC tools.\\nAnd when it comes to SaaS, so like Dropbox box, et cetera,\\nyou know, again, the call out for identity management.\\n\\nSo again, this is kind of a quick overview\\nof looking at The Open Group architecture\\nand breaking it down by actual capabilities.\\nSo you can then go to The Open Group architecture and say,\\n\\\"Well, how do we actually build something\\nthat we have or upgrade what we have into something\\nthat meets what The Open Group guidelines suggests\\nas best practice for zero trust?\\\"\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Lesson 5: Open Group

Now that we've covered\\nthe NIST zero trust principles or commandments\\nas well as we covered other guidelines\\nlike the Open Group guideline,\\nlet's now look at the NIST architecture,\\nand this comes from the NIST 800-207\\nzero trust architecture.\\nNow, at first glance is architecture may look very different\\nfrom what the Open Group's talking about,\\nbut it actually has very similar components.\\nIt starts off with a subject,\\nwhich could be a user or identity,\\nas well as a system on a untrusted network\\ntrying to connect to a resource.\\n\\nThe resource could be an application in the cloud,\\non-prem, whatever it may be.\\nSo essentially this would be the assets,\\napplications, et cetera,\\nconnecting to what needs to be secured.\\nThen you have your policy enforcement engine,\\nwhich similar to the Open Group form architecture\\nis basically a pit stop\\nthat is going to check for all sorts of things.\\nAnd the way that works,\\nyou have a policy engine with administrators,\\nbut essentially this whole infrastructure\\nis going to validate things like, is that Joey?\\nIs that his personal laptop?\\nIt's going to validate the risk.\\n\\nSo does the system have the latest updates?\\nIs it corporate issued or not?\\nThings like time, is it 3:00 am?\\nWhere is it located?\\nAll the things we've covered in earlier lessons\\nare going to happen here.\\nNow what's a little different about this NIST architecture\\nis they also have similar topics\\nlike threat intelligence, et cetera,\\nbut they're all feeding the entire architecture\\nversus the security point or versus feeding the SOC.\\nSo the information feeding this\\ncould be things like activity logs,\\nthreat intelligence, your co compliancy tools,\\nthis will be like the GRC concepts we talked about,\\nas well as general like governance around managing devices,\\nmaking sure they have the latest build and stuff.\\n\\nAll this is being seen\\nas generally feeding this architecture,\\nwhich some may apply to making sure that the end users\\nhave the latest builds\\nor making sure the endpoint servers, et cetera,\\nhave the latest builds.\\nThe compliancy components could basically be checking,\\nmaking sure these are meeting compliance,\\nmaking sure these meeting compliance,\\nbut essentially these are feeding into this architecture.\\nAnd then the other interesting thing on the NIST 800-207\\nis the components,\\nthe capabilities to make this thing work\\nare here on the right.\\n\\nYou have your PKI, identity management systems,\\nwhich are needed in order for this engine\\nto be able to validate the who and what's connecting.\\nYou got your data access policies.\\nSo the policies that would either check to say,\\n\\\"Is this allowed or not allowed?\\\"\\nare being fed into this\\nas well as one thing that's not specifically called out,\\nbut obviously exists here\\nwould be your security operations center,\\nwhich are going to have your SIEM, SOAR, XDR type tools\\nas well as be responsible\\nfor these other tools to make this thing work.\\n\\nSo basically the NIST zero trust 800-207 architecture\\nhas the same fundamentals\\nas the zero trust architecture that we've covered\\nand we'll be covering in future lessons\\nas well as the Open Group.\\nSomething is trying to connect to something else,\\nthere's a policy enforcement engine\\nthat's going to be checking\\nto make sure that the risk context, et cetera\\nis there before this is being allowed.\\nAnd then you got various components\\nthat are going to feed\\nto make sure you have the latest context\\nas well as various components\\nthat are part of the infrastructure to make this work.\\n\\nAnd then behind all this is the security operation center\\nmonitoring everything\\nto make sure or assume that there isn't\\nor hopefully identify any type of breach.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2022568\",\"duration\":1045,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Capability heat

Now that we've covered the NIST zero trust principles\\nand NIST zero trust architecture,\\nonce again, we need to ask a very important question,\\nwhich is, how do you actually use this?\\nHow do you convert these high-level concepts and components\\ninto something that you can actually take action on?\\nThe answer is converting this into a heat map.\\nNow, within this architecture,\\nthere are specific capabilities being called out.\\n\\nExamples of these components are a CDN system.\\nThis would be your system.\\nIt's about managing assets, managing their builds,\\nmaking sure you're running the latest updates,\\nmaking sure they're basically secure.\\nThis also can be your co compliancy systems.\\nSo, sometimes the CDM system\\nalso has co compliancy components.\\nBut essentially, what these two are talking about,\\nas well as a government risk and compliance system\\nis talking about is,\\nis are the assets running the latest builds?\\nIf a server's being lit up in Google Cloud or Amazon?\\nDoes it have the latest patches?\\nAll those components.\\n\\nSo, this is your vulnerability,\\nyour asset management programs.\\nOther components being called out,\\nthe identity management framework.\\nSo, this will be your multi-factor authentications.\\nThis would be things like your active directories\\nor things managing identities,\\nas well as non-user identities.\\nSo, making sure your servers are trusted\\nvia like a PKI system.\\nSo, this is also being called out in the NIST guidelines.\\nYou have your policy enforcement engine essentially here,\\nwhich is basically how do you enforce checking context,\\nrisk, et cetera,\\nand then only allowing least privilege access.\\n\\nThis could be your secure access service edge,\\nor SASE solution.\\nAnd this could exist on the endpoint,\\nthis can be somewhere on the network or cloud,\\nor at the application layer.\\nWherever you want to enforce policy.\\nNIST calls out the SIEM,\\nbut this really is your XDR platform.\\nSo SIEM, SOAR, XDR that the SOC would use\\nto monitor and respond to events.\\nAnd then lastly, there's the other information,\\nthreat intelligence, AI, big data, and other forms of data\\nthat can feed into these security tools\\nto basically give more real-time context.\\n\\nThese are essentially the ingredients,\\nbut let me show you some examples\\nof actual vendor technology filling into these ingredients.\\nNow, I'm going to give you examples.\\nNot saying these vendors\\nare the only vendors or the best vendors.\\nThese are just examples\\nthat compliment what's being asked by NIST.\\nFirst, we'll go to Microsoft\\nand look at what a CDM or compliancy tool could look like.\\nIn the world of Microsoft,\\nthis would be the Microsoft Manager Admin Center,\\nand basically, this tool is a way to look at your assets.\\n\\nSo, essentially, you are getting an idea\\nof what is installed within your network\\nor what your organization's responsible for.\\nMaybe it's corporate-issued laptops, phones, et cetera,\\nand then being able to monitor compliance status,\\nas well as their configuration status.\\nSo, is this device running the latest build?\\nIs it patched, et cetera?\\nIs it meeting all compliancy requirements?\\nCompliancy could be many sort of things.\\nIt could be things that you set specifically,\\nor maybe you're adopting industry guidelines\\nand seeing how you compare to industry guidelines,\\nor it could be adopting required compliancy,\\nlike PCI or something like that.\\n\\nBut this is one example, and there's many out there,\\nof CDM and co compliancy based tools.\\nAnother example of a CDM tool from Microsoft\\nis Microsoft Defender for IoT.\\nAnd I bring this example up\\nbecause IoT devices are handled differently.\\nUnlike a traditional laptop, desktop, et cetera,\\nyou can't install an agent.\\nSo, essentially, there are three components\\nwith an IoT based CDM tool.\\n\\nFirst, there's profiling.\\nAnd profiling is essentially how you can understand\\nwhat's really running on an IoT device.\\nSo, for example, let's say you have a refrigerator,\\nthat alone is not going to tell you about security risk.\\nYou need to be able to use things\\nlike DHCP, DNS, ARP, et cetera to be able to say,\\n\\\"Oh, that's actually has this type of NIC card.\\nMaybe it's running Apache Struts,\\nand the Struts component is what's vulnerable.\\\"\\nBut you can never know that if you can't profile the device\\nbecause a lot of IoT devices\\ndo not allow the installation of an agent.\\n\\nTherefore, you need a network\\nor some way to fingerprint that device.\\nThe second capability for a CDM IoT-type solution\\nwould be the vulnerability scanner,\\nwhich you can see here would be the ability to say,\\n\\\"This is what's actually a risk.\\\"\\nAnd we cover the idea of vulnerability scanning\\nin an earlier lesson.\\nSo, using things like a MITRE scoring system,\\nwhich my personal recommendation\\nis you can't 100% rely on that because a high risk,\\nlike things being shown here as critical,\\ndoesn't mean that something that's considered major\\nis a least important,\\nor not as important as the critical one.\\n\\nI mean, essentially, these components here,\\nif they're owned and gives root access to some attacker,\\nthat is just as bad as one of these higher based ones.\\nBut the idea is you have some kind\\nof vulnerability management system\\nto allow some understanding of the associated risk.\\nBut again, you need the profile and component,\\nor else, the vulnerabilities of component\\nwill not be able to understand what's being assessed.\\nLastly, in an IoT security solution\\nshould be some way to take a response.\\n\\nSo, if you're seeing potential risky devices,\\ntypically, we're talking segmentation,\\nbut you need some way to then respond.\\nWhether it's knocking the device off the network\\nor putting on a least important network\\nor that risk doesn't jeopardize the risk\\nor the devices in other parts of the network.\\nSo, again, this is an example\\nof a IoT CDM-type solution from Microsoft,\\nand there are many others that are out there.\\nHere's an example of an identity management solution.\\nOnce again, we'll go to the Microsoft world\\nand look at Microsoft Admin Center.\\n\\nIdentity management solution would be everything\\nfrom understanding who has what role.\\nSo, you would, for example, have Joey is an employee,\\nBob is an admin, et cetera,\\nas well as looking at things like user risk.\\nSo, here, you got your MFA, or a registration policy,\\nas well as monitoring the performance of users.\\nSo, high-risk users, example can be somebody\\ncontinuously having to reset their password,\\nor other activities that are associated\\nwith high-risk users.\\n\\nSo, there are many identity management solutions out there.\\nThat could be one platform or different components.\\nThis is one example from Microsoft.\\nMoving away from users and looking more at servers,\\nyou get into concepts like your PKI options.\\nSo, in this example here, I'm showing one from DigiCert,\\nbut basically, this is the way to get a third party\\nto prove and validate the trust of servers.\\nSo, if I'm going to log into some server,\\nthe PKI from DigiCert proves that this server\\nis actually who it says it is,\\nversus using something like self-signed search or something,\\nwhere that can be an attacker\\nor some malicious party posing as something else.\\n\\nIn an early lesson, I covered the idea of SASE,\\nand here's an example of a SASE solution from Zscaler.\\nActually, in this example,\\nI'm showing Zscaler mixed with Microsoft.\\nSo, Microsoft is acting as the endpoint security,\\nor EDR-type tools,\\nMicrosoft is acting as the identity management tool,\\nand Microsoft is acting as the XDR platform.\\nHowever, Zscaler is acting as the policy enforcement engine.\\nThe way Zscaler works in this example,\\nyou have some way to force the end user or end components\\ninto the Zscaler cloud.\\n\\nThis could be done via an agent,\\nwhere the agent means the user could be\\nanywhere in the world,\\nand when they try to go to a website\\nor try to go to an application,\\nthe agent is forcing 'em through the Zscaler network.\\nAnother option could be SD-WAN.\\nSo, this user connects to the corporate network,\\nand the corporate network uses a router\\nand forces traffic via SD-WAN.\\nBut basically, with the Zscaler infrastructure,\\nthe traffic needs to get into this infrastructure.\\n\\nIn this Zscaler example,\\nthey also need to connect the applications.\\nSo, whether they're in the cloud or on-prem,\\nthere is a component.\\nIt's basically a VM that has one-way communication.\\nSo, let's say that you have this application is on-prem,\\nanother application's in the cloud, from a user perspective,\\nthey're going to be connecting to the Zscaler infrastructure\\nand getting access, direct access,\\nto that application via this system.\\nSo, if it's on-prem, the on-prem would have\\nthat virtual one-Way communication server,\\nthe cloud app would have the one-way server.\\n\\nSo, either way, from the user perspective,\\nit always looks like it's in the cloud\\nand it's always available, which by the way too,\\nthe Zscaler offering has WAN optimization\\nand other components\\nto make sure this performance is at the best it can be.\\nIf the user wants to go to the internet,\\nagain the connecting through the Zscaler infrastructure,\\nthey would then be able to go through the internet\\nif they pass your traditional stack of security checks.\\nThat could be things like what a next-gen firewall\\nor a content filter would check for,\\nmaking sure that whatever policies,\\nmaybe no gambling, porn, et cetera,\\nchecking for threats and other, again,\\ncommon security checks to make sure\\nthat the system and user is safe\\nbefore they're allowed to go to the internet.\\n\\nThat can occur via the cloud.\\nAnother interesting component would be,\\nlet's say we're talking about a SaaS app.\\nSo in the world of SaaS, typically, to provide security,\\nthe concept of CASB, cloud access security broker,\\ncomes into play.\\nAnd Zscaler can act as an example,\\nwould be like an in-line CASB,\\nwhere when the user tries to go to a SaaS app,\\nthe CASB component is being put in place\\nto make sure, again, whatever policies\\nthat want to be enforced through a CASB function\\nare being enforced.\\n\\nSo, again, Zscaler is one example of a SASE offering,\\nbut the idea would be\\nis you connect your public or private apps,\\nyou force the user via an agent or SD-WAN\\nor some component into the Zscaler infrastructure,\\nand then the Zscaler infrastructure\\nwill then be that policy enforcement engine,\\nand either allow one-time, single access to the applications\\nor allow access to SaaS or to the internet.\\nAnd when it comes to zero trust,\\nthese applications can't communicate with each other.\\n\\nYou have to go through here to get to the application.\\nAnd again, through the Zscaler infrastructure,\\nand it denies this to allow to meet\\nthat basically dynamic segmentation component of zero trust.\\nAnother example of a tool from this NIST architecture\\nis the SIEM, which really it's going to be SIEM and SOAR,\\nor the whole XDR platform.\\nOne very popular offering is Splunk.\\n\\nSplunk is basically a SIEM,\\nand with Splunk Phantom as SOAR,\\nbut traditional Splunk would be a place\\nto send all of your security events\\nto have the single pane of glass\\nto understand what's going on in the environment.\\nSplunk's very known for their applications and plugins.\\nSo you can take a ton of data.\\nAnd then from there,\\nbuild a dashboard specifically for whatever function\\nor whatever SOC user is looking to basically see.\\nSo, if you want to understand OT security posture,\\nthis example, you can take all the data\\nfrom all the various components\\nand filter it down and create a nice dashboard.\\n\\nSo, you basically pull up that dashboard\\nand immediately be able to see what you need to see.\\nSame if it's you're interested in threats,\\nyou can basically take the same data,\\nfilter it a different way\\nto understand the threats associated in the environment.\\nSplunk also can be a SOAR,\\nand that's be the Phantom components.\\nAnd like with the SOAR,\\nrather than focusing on monitoring things,\\nnow we're focusing on automation,\\nwe're focusing on how things are being resolved,\\nso how actions are being taken,\\nhow fast the actions are being taken,\\nwhat's the associated cost of the users and time to do this.\\n\\nBut really with SOAR,\\nwe're talking about automation and response,\\nand this dashboard is one example\\nof how Splunk could show that.\\nI've called out GRC, or government risk compliancy tools,\\nthroughout the course.\\nHere's an example one, RSA Archer.\\nWith RSA Archer, you can have different dashboards\\nfocused on different co compliancy needs.\\nMaybe you're looking at requirements around PCI\\nor HIPAA or something.\\nMaybe you're looking at industry guidelines.\\n\\nAnd the idea is you not only want to understand right now,\\nso not be point in time,\\nbut be continuously looking at\\nhow the organization is meeting these requirements,\\nbut you also want to be able to report on this.\\nSo, if you're ever being audited\\nor you got to prove that you're meeting\\nwhatever compliance requirements,\\nyou have a way to basically visually see that\\nand then provide evidence.\\nSegmentation is obviously a very important component\\nwith zero trust,\\nand one example of providing segmentation\\ncould be from Cisco.\\n\\nNow in this example,\\nI'm showing Cisco's flagship NAC solution,\\nor network access control solution,\\nat one point was called Identity Services Engine.\\nI believe now it's being rebranded to Cisco Secure Access.\\nBut the ideas, this is one option\\nwhere you can look at the who or what,\\nand then based on policies,\\ncontrol how those users and and systems\\nare being or what they're connecting to,\\nand limit those connections\\nto a least privileged access approach.\\nNow, with this kind of solution,\\nthere are different ways to enforce things.\\n\\nI talked about in the segmentation lesson\\nthat maybe you're going to leverage VLANs, ACLs.\\nI even called out that solutions like this\\ncould go to the packet layer, known as tagging,\\nwhere you're literally looking at each packet\\nand then allowing or not allowing that packet\\nas it transverses through the network.\\nBut again, this is one example of a solution\\nthat can perform dynamic segmentation.\\nSo, essentially,\\nif you're going to take a guideline architecture,\\nlike the NIST 800-207,\\nand try to convert this into something you can use,\\nyou can look at this architecture\\nand melt it down into security capabilities.\\n\\nThere are security capabilities for the end users,\\ndesktops, et cetera,\\nas well as components for servers and stuff in the cloud.\\nThere are capabilities around subjects.\\nSo, your identity management components,\\nmulti-factor authentication, et cetera.\\nThere are components around how policies will be enforced.\\nAnd the example I just provided in this lesson\\nwas from Zscaler,\\nbut basically, you can use secure access service edge\\nor some other policy enforcement solution.\\n\\nSo, when looking at the NIST 800-207 architecture\\nand trying to convert this\\ninto something that you can take action on,\\nreally what we're talking about is melting this down\\ninto security capabilities\\nor something that you can create a heat map against.\\nSo, essentially, you have your host-based,\\nendpoint-based security tools\\nthat also can exist on the servers and desktops,\\nyour EDRs, et cetera.\\nYou have your identity management tools,\\nso your multifactor authentication,\\nactive directories, et cetera.\\n\\nYou have your policy enforcement tools.\\nThis will be, in this example, I cover the Zscaler option,\\nbut some kind of maybe secure access service edge,\\nor other method to basically check for policy\\nand enforce policy\\nand make sure that least privilege is being distributed,\\nas well as dynamic network access,\\nas well as dynamic network segmentation.\\nYou have other components like co compliancy, GRC tools,\\nasset management tools to look at.\\n\\nYou have potential enhancement tools\\nlike threat intelligence, AI, et cetera.\\nAnd then finally, you have your SOC\\nthat will be using your XDR platform\\nand other components.\\nBack to Joey's best practice capability mapping,\\nyou can take something like this NIST guideline publication\\nand convert what's being asked into a heat map.\\nSo, essentially, you can see where you're at,\\nsee what NIST is recommending,\\nand then from there, create for you and plan\\nto basically meet zero trust guidelines,\\nsuch as those from NIST.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Lesson 6: NIST 800-207

At this point we have covered zero trust\\nbest practice principles,\\nzero trust best practice architectures.\\nWe've covered two very popular guidelines,\\nthe open group guideline,\\nas well as the NIST guideline for zero trust.\\nWhat I'm going to do now on this section\\nis look at my guideline.\\nSo rather than focusing on some published guideline,\\ntake all the best practices covered through this course,\\ncreate my own guideline, create my own principles,\\nand create my own architecture.\\n\\nSo essentially, if we're going to create our own principles,\\nbasically what we're talking about is moving\\nfrom the classic security approach\\nto a more modern approach.\\nAnd these are topics I covered earlier in this lesson.\\nThe classic approach would be\\nhaving your stack of security products,\\nhaving users inside or outside the network.\\nSo we'll call this the DMZ.\\nAnd if they're outside the network, they're using a VPN\\nto go through the security stack.\\nIf they're in the network,\\nthey're coming through the security stack.\\n\\nAnd we talked about how this approach\\nis broken for many reasons.\\nIn this new zero trust and modern security approach,\\nwe're talking about being user-focused.\\nSo we'll have the user application,\\nand we talk about having this policy enforcement engine,\\nwhich we saw both in the open group\\nand in the NIST publications.\\nHow they have a place\\nthat is basically validating context risk and other factors\\nbefore allowing access.\\n\\nAnd when we allow access,\\nthat access is a one-time connection,\\nmeaning that you can't connect once,\\nand then have access to all these resources.\\nWhen you want to access the first resource,\\nyou go through this policy engine.\\nAnd then when you want to access another resource,\\nyou go through the policy engine\\nand these connections are not allowed.\\nThat's essentially what we're talking about\\nin our vendor Neutral Zero Trust guideline\\nthat we're going over right now.\\n\\nAs talked about earlier,\\nour modern zero trust principles\\nare really based on four components,\\nalways verifying explicitly,\\nwhich basically means validating the who and the what,\\nthe risk, the context, all that.\\nThere is the policy enforcement engine,\\nwhich is made up of two principles.\\nBasically ensuring lease privilege access\\nand dynamic segmentation.\\nSo based on the context and stuff you see,\\nI'm going to allow or deny,\\nbut if you allow, you're going to allow only specific access.\\n\\nSo it's segmented.\\nSo only specific access via lease privilege.\\nSo you're only allowed to access\\nwhat you should be authorized to access.\\nThe last principle is the assume breach,\\nand this is our security operation center\\nmonitoring whole system.\\nThis could also be things like the GRC\\nor the compliance as well as the efficiency.\\nSo making sure you have automation versus manual efforts,\\nso playbooks, all those DevOps, et cetera,\\nto make sure this system runs effectively.\\n\\nLooking at the first principle, always verifying explicitly.\\nYou have various technologies that could be used.\\nIf you need to verify identity,\\nyou have technologies like multifactor authentication.\\nIf you need to have other context components,\\nit could be things like looking at the time, you know,\\nwhy is it 3:00 AM that Joey's trying to connect.\\nMaybe the location.\\nWhy is Joey located in China when he works from the USA.\\nOther things to think about is validating my system.\\n\\nMaybe it's my smartphone,\\nmaybe it's a corporate issued laptop.\\nAnd to understand if it's corporate issued,\\nmaybe you're looking at things like certificates,\\nor you can go traditional and have like a Mac address\\nor a WOW or denylist.\\nOther things that you can think about can be maybe tokens.\\nSo a physical RSA token.\\nSo you have this pin number that's constantly rotating\\nor maybe a soft token on a phone.\\nLastly, things in the list could be things like\\nuser behavior analytics.\\n\\nThis is more of allowing the security operation center\\nto take all this context and create a baseline,\\nand have other ways to validate that the users\\nand identities are not being compromised.\\nEssentially looking at that attack vector,\\nwhere the threat would be one of these\\nor more of these moans are compromised,\\nallowing an attacker to pose as a trusted resource,\\nand then bypass security.\\nFrom an identity perspective.\\nI've talked about AAA.\\nBut essentially if you're going to melt on AAA,\\nit's basically having the way to tell the who.\\n\\nSo who is it?\\nHow do you know who it is?\\nThe what?\\nIs it maybe a cert, is it maybe a Mac address, et cetera?\\nAnd then some kind of accounting\\nThe way to basically monitor to make sure that the who\\nand what continues to be validated as who and what.\\nSo this is commonly the AAA.\\nNow multifactor authentication by itself is important,\\nbut there are more modern ways of doing this.\\nFor example, what's becoming very common is\\ncalled passwordless.\\nSo passwordless may sound like you're not using a password,\\nbut there actually is some passwords involved.\\n\\nPasswordless may have passwords on the initial access.\\nBut once you establish the accounting,\\nthe idea of password is is using things\\nlike facial recognition,\\nand basically getting rid of the password\\nor using more of something you are or something you have.\\nOne common example would be Microsoft Hello.\\nAnd in order to make something like this to work,\\nyou need to have a way where the users,\\nwherever they're at in the world,\\ncan validate their facial recognition to get access\\nto whatever they're getting access to.\\n\\nSo for example, if we're talking Microsoft,\\nand you have an on-prem active directory system,\\npasswordless won't work.\\nBecause an on-prem active directory system\\nwould be behind a security infrastructure,\\nwe'll call it a DMZ and security stack.\\nSo if it's over here and the user is over here,\\nand they need to look at their phone and log in,\\nthere's no way for that to happen.\\nSo if you talk to Microsoft,\\nthey're going to say you need to migrate to Azure AD.\\nSo when a person logs in,\\nthey can always have access to that system.\\n\\nBut again, map multifactor authentication.\\nThere's many modern ways of doing this.\\nThere's also like tokens that people can bring around\\nor soft tokens, et cetera.\\nBut essentially, there are various components\\nand there are various vendors in this space.\\nAnd a question to you would be,\\nif you're going to create a modern zero trust architecture is\\nhow are you doing your identity management program?\\nAlso, is there telemetry?\\nIs there behavior analytics\\nand other components that could be fed to the SOC,\\nso they can monitor and identify if identities\\nare being compromised?\\nThis is very important.\\n\\nThis is reducing the risk of the attack vector.\\nAnd we covered attack vectors in an earlier lesson,\\nbut an attack vector would be compromising\\nthe identity management program.\\nSo then you can use stolen credentials to log into systems\\nand bypass security.\\nI've talked about not only\\nyou should be thinking about users,\\nbut I've talked about in real essence the idea of IoT.\\nAnd IoT devices essentially\\ncould be anything from a refrigerator, to a card reader,\\nto a camera and everything in between.\\n\\nAnd a lot of these devices you can't install an agent.\\nSo really you need to have profiling.\\nSo if we're talking about fingerprinting\\nand understanding the who and what,\\nprofiling is a component to address IoT.\\nProfiling really requires some way\\nto use available network traffic to understand what it is.\\nSo we're talking DHCP, DNS, ARP,\\nsomething to basically fingerprint.\\nSo if you have a refrigerator, you can break down\\nwhat is the actual network component,\\nand say, oh, that's actually this type of NIC card\\nor running on, this is this specific application.\\n\\nThis is going to allow your vulnerability management tool\\nto then break down those components,\\nand then identify the potential risk associated\\nwith what's being ran.\\nSo you can identify that there's a lot of risk\\nwith an IoT device.\\nSo yeah, at high level it's a refrigerator,\\nbut at detail is maybe a Apache running\\na vulnerable version of struts.\\nWhen it comes to dynamic segmentation,\\nwhat we're talking about is not traditional segmentation.\\nSo traditional segmentation would be\\nlet's just create some VLANs or ACLS\\nand basically have one network,\\nanother network and another network.\\n\\nAnd when you connect to that network from there,\\nthe users have free will within that network.\\nThat is not meeting current zero trust guidelines.\\nBecause you're not necessarily doing zero trust,\\nyou're doing limited trust.\\nZero trust means that the user or contractor,\\nwhoever has one specific access\\nto one specific system,\\nand that one system is segmented from everything else.\\nThere are different ways of doing this.\\nOne example would be using some kind of network\\naccess control solution,\\nlike the example I'm showing here.\\n\\nSo for example, on this solution,\\nif you're going to use a next solution to accomplish this,\\nyou got me, the employee,\\nand there's a way to basically verify me\\nwhether it's multifactor, et cetera.\\nBut also you may verify my device,\\nyou may use certificates, et cetera.\\nSo we have certificates, passwords,\\nhowever you want to basically verify me.\\nAnd then you have your policy enforcement engine.\\nSo in this case you got a Mac solution doing it\\nversus like a SASE or something.\\nAnd based on that outcome,\\nyou will provision specific access.\\n\\nSo me as an employee, I can access these specific systems.\\nAnd in a zero trust environment,\\neach access should be done individually.\\nBut that's essentially how a NAC solution could be used\\nto accomplish the dynamic network segmentation\\nrequirements for zero trust.\\nAnd this example also you have like a contractor\\nthat maybe it doesn't have access to certain things.\\nSo when the contractor, in this case Alice,\\ntries to connect to this particular system,\\nthey're denied, but they can connect to these systems.\\n\\nBut essentially you got the same fundamental components.\\nThings trying to connect to things\\nwith a policy enforcement engine in between.\\nNow, segmentation doesn't have to be network oriented.\\nA lot of cloud providers, so the big ones like your Amazon\\nor Microsoft Azure, like I'm showing here,\\nor Google also have various forms of virtual\\nand cloud-based segmentation.\\nSo what I'm showing here is an example\\nof like the Microsoft Amazon World,\\nthe Microsoft Azure world where you have a a region\\nthat's segmented down to various subscriptions.\\n\\nSo you can think of these as kind of like virtual networks.\\nSo you have this network and this network,\\nwhere if a system here wants to talk to a system here,\\nit can't because it's not part of that second network.\\nBut these systems have the ability to talk to each other.\\nSo there are various ways which are kind of at a scope\\nof this zero trust course,\\nbut there are various ways to leverage\\nwhatever cloud provider segmentation.\\nSo when a zero trust access solution is provisioning access\\nwithin this system, the access can be controlled\\nto one specific system or you can allow the internal access.\\n\\nSo this again is more around like host base,\\nserver base, security components that would be set up\\nthat basically are outside of your zero trust access.\\nThe zero trust is going to access specific resources,\\nbut it doesn't mean that these\\nresources should not be segmented.\\n'Cause what you don't want to have happen is\\nyou do this whole zero trust thing,\\nbut then the system itself has free reign.\\n'Cause if the system gets compromised\\nand you don't have segmentation, that malware,\\nthat threat can spread around.\\nSo the cloud segmentation\\nor network segmentation reduces that risk.\\n\\nHere's an example of a SASE\\nor secure access service edge solution.\\nThis is one from Zscaler,\\nand it's kind of mixed in with the Microsoft one.\\nI cover this in the open group.\\nThe kind of recap on this, you got basically EDR solutions.\\nYou got an identity management solution,\\nyou got your XDR platform.\\nThis is all the Microsoft stuff,\\nbut whatever stuff you have, in this case,\\nthe policy enforcement engine is your Zscaler solution.\\nAnd this example, there could be an agent being used\\nor there could be a SD-WAN solution forcing traffic\\ninto the Zscaler infrastructure.\\n\\nIn this use case, you got a Zscaler virtual server\\nthat's connecting whether it's on-prem,\\nso on-prem would be maybe something different\\nor a cloud app.\\nBut somehow these are being connected to the infrastructure.\\nSo when the user says I need to connect to something,\\nZscaler is making that connection happen\\nin a one-time fashion every time it's happening.\\nAnd basically not allowing app to app communication,\\nwhether it's on-prem or in the cloud.\\nFor users wanting to get to the internet,\\nthey also would go through the Zscaler infrastructure.\\n\\nThey get to the internet, which while going through there,\\nthe security stack, your content filtering, IPS,\\net cetera, could be enforced.\\nAs well as if there's a SaaS app out there.\\nYour cloud access security broker,\\ninline kind of CASB capabilities can also be enforced.\\nThis would be an example\\nof enforcing the policy engine\\nin our modern zero trust architecture.\\nNow the force component is assuming breach.\\nAnd assuming breach is basically\\nbreach detection technologies.\\n\\nIn an earlier lesson, we talked about how a threat basically\\nneeds to find a vulnerability.\\nAnd the threat executes an attack against the vulnerability\\nand as a result does some action.\\nThat's what we're focusing on here.\\nWe're not focusing on preventing threats.\\nWhen we talk about assumed breach, we are focused on\\nwhat happens when a breach occurs.\\nWe're almost assuming the breach, as we said is occurring,\\nand we're always looking for potential risky behavior.\\n\\nSo technologies here could be anything from\\nyour telemetry tools, baseline tools, anomaly tools.\\nSo this is what normal looks like.\\nIdentifying unusual behavior.\\nIt can be user behavior analytics.\\nSo this is how users are logging in.\\nAnd if you've got some user trying to log\\ninto a bunch of systems or doing a bunch of password resets,\\nthose would be the anomalies to look at.\\nThis will also look at monitoring the the assets.\\nSo what processes are being run?\\nAre they running malicious?\\nSo maybe malware has been unfortunately\\ninstalled in some systems.\\n\\nSo the idea of assuming breach is really the tools\\nthat SOC would use to basically monitor\\nthis zero trust architecture.\\nThis essentially is a breakdown of what I believe\\nare the zero trust modern capabilities,\\nand these are things that you should be heat mapping\\nyourself against as you build your zero trust architecture.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3961516\",\"duration\":570,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Planning a Zero Trust design: Business

We've covered a lot.\\nWe've covered zero trust best practices\\nfrom principle to architecture perspectives.\\nWe've even looked at specific guidelines.\\nWe reviewed The Open Group and NIST guidelines.\\nBut the important thing\\nis you getting value out of this course,\\nwhich is how do you actually take this knowledge\\nand convert it into actionable items.\\nWhat you're going to need to do is first understand\\nwhat ingredients you need to create a zero trust program.\\nThis list here are my recommendations.\\n\\nAt the top of the list is business goals.\\nBusiness goals could be anything\\nfrom how the organization makes money\\nto what essentially is seen as success.\\nSo if you provide a service,\\nmaybe it's providing that service\\nwith a certain success rate.\\nFrom a money perspective,\\nnot only could it be making money,\\nbut maybe growing the business.\\nWhatever it may be,\\nit's very important to understand\\nhow the organization sees success.\\nSo when you start mapping out your zero trust program,\\nyou can align with that success.\\n\\nNext is technical goals.\\nWhich technical goals need to align to the business?\\nSo you cannot have a top technical goal\\naligning to a bottom business objective.\\nThey need to match.\\nAnd technical goals and technical projects,\\nat least common ones I see,\\ncould be anything from modernizing the MFA solution\\nor implementing a segmentation solution or anything else.\\nAnd the idea is if you can capture what's in that list\\nand build it into the zero trust program,\\nyou're more likely to get support for that program.\\n\\nNext is understanding what you have.\\nSo essentially this is all the heat mapping training\\nI've been providing in this course,\\nwhich is understanding where you're at\\nand where are the gaps.\\nHeat mapping could be anything from it's missing,\\nor something that's just not effective\\nor not fully deployed,\\nbut you need to understand where you're at.\\n'Cause you can't just go and say,\\nwe have to buy a whole new thing\\nor rip and replace everything.\\nYou're less likely to to have success\\nif you just go and ask for that,\\nversus seeing where you're at\\nand building a crawl, walk, run program\\nto basically move to a zero trust architecture.\\n\\nBeyond technology on the list here is your people.\\nDo you have the right people?\\nMeaning, do you not only have people\\nto manage and work in this new architecture,\\ndo they have the right skills?\\nMaybe there's going to be training gaps.\\nMaybe it just doesn't make sense\\nfor you to have such people on staff.\\nSo you can start looking at a hybrid environment\\nwhere you outsource tier one or tier two.\\nSo maybe you're acquiring a new SASE or XDR platform,\\nand you're going to have that vendor also manage that platform.\\n\\nThese are things to think about.\\nNext on the list, a very obvious one is budget.\\nIn the end, changes have a cost associated,\\nbut I highly recommend for you not to go right to budget.\\n'Cause in the end, these earlier items, business goals,\\ntechnical goals, understanding what you have,\\nthat gap analysis and justifying your program\\nwill unlock the budget.\\nIf you just go in and say,\\nI need this money in order to accomplish this outcome,\\nyou're less likely to basically have a sponsor\\nand be provided that resource.\\n\\nHowever, if you can show\\nhow zero trust will become an enabler\\nand align to the business and technical goals,\\nand how you are looking at what you have\\nand just making tweaks to what you have,\\nyou're more likely to get that budget\\nthat you need to make your program a reality.\\nFinally, there's going to be other requirements\\nthat we haven't really talked about in this course.\\nThose could be things like data sovereignty.\\nData sovereignty is forcing the traffic\\nand forcing the data to remain\\nwithin country or some kind of bounds.\\n\\nSo for example, if you're in Europe,\\nlet's say you're in Germany,\\nand you're going to start using some SaaS\\nor cloud-based solution,\\neven though it's in the cloud,\\nit must stay within country.\\nLike you can't have an XDR platform\\nwhere your data goes to the platform,\\nbut that actual platform is in Australia,\\nChina, or somewhere else.\\nSo there may be data sovereignty requirements,\\nor you want to use certain technologies,\\nbut they just don't meet those requirements.\\nSame from a compliancy perspective when it comes\\nto things like clearance and sensitivity.\\n\\nMaybe you have a top secret SCI in the USA\\nor some banking or other cleared environment\\nwhere you want to have some cloud-based technology,\\nbut it's just not allowed.\\nIt violates compliance.\\nTherefore, you need to have some on-premise\\nor air gap-like technologies.\\nThese are things to think about.\\nThese are the key ingredients\\nas you start to kind of build\\nthat plan for where you're at now\\nand how you're going to move to a zero trust architecture.\\nThe first thing to look at\\nwhen it comes to your ingredients\\nfor building a zero trust architecture\\nis your business goals.\\n\\nAnd I can't stress how important it is to start\\nwith understanding what's important to your business.\\nBusiness goals don't have to be money.\\nMoney is on here, but it could be other things.\\nEssentially we're talking about\\nwhat is success for the business.\\nMaybe it's the brand.\\nMaybe it's providing some service.\\nWhatever it may be,\\nI highly recommend for you\\nto create a list and rank that list\\nand validate it with leadership within the organization,\\nbecause your goal is to figure out how these goals align\\nto your objectives for zero trust.\\n\\nIf you can show that by moving\\nto the zero trust architecture,\\nyou're going to be an enabler,\\nyou're going to help accomplish these type of goals,\\nyou're going to have less like pushback\\nwhen it comes to asking for budget,\\nasking for people, asking for resources.\\nIt's more likely that you're going to have access\\nto more budget and have more success with your requests.\\nCommon ones I see when it comes\\nto like understanding business goals\\nand aligning it to zero trust\\nare things like expanding the footprint\\nor basically adding more responsibility to security.\\n\\nWhen something like that occurs with organizations,\\nit starts to make sense where it's like, you know,\\nthe traditional approach of buying more appliances,\\ncreating more VPNs,\\ncreating more complex segmentation\\nstarts to just not make sense anymore.\\nSo it's a good point to say, all right,\\nwell, if we're going to expand the business,\\nif that's the business goal,\\nnow is a good time to start looking at zero trust.\\nBut stop doing it the old way\\nand look at a new modern way to allow users\\nand resources to get access\\nto basically what's needed and only what's needed,\\nhence least privilege access.\\n\\nSo whatever your business goals are,\\nI highly recommend for you to incorporate that\\nas your first step when you start\\nto plan out your zero trust architecture.\\nLater in this lesson,\\nwhat I'm going to be looking at is some examples\\nof building out zero trust programs.\\nWhat I'll do is I'll look at two different examples.\\nOne will be ABC Gaming,\\nwhich ABC Gaming could represent a online gaming company.\\nThink of basically you are buying a game,\\nso you go to the gaming company's website.\\n\\nOr maybe you're playing the game,\\nand while you're playing it,\\nyou want to add more games\\nso you can immediately buy those games,\\nuse your credit card, et cetera,\\nand then from there, get access to your game.\\nThings a company would care about in this space\\nwould be making sure the game is always available.\\nThey're going to care about basically being able\\nto constantly have the ability\\nto buy into their game to make more money.\\nSo there's services they're offering.\\nSo if I'm interested in buying,\\nI could use my credit card,\\nwhich means they got to meet things\\nlike PCI DSS and other compliance.\\n\\nA company like this is going to care about their brand,\\nbecause they want to have their games\\nbe the coolest and most innovative,\\nor you'll go buy from some other game.\\nThey're probably going to be very cloud-oriented\\nand very invested in the idea of technology\\nversus other organizations that are more brick and mortar\\nand have your traditional network,\\nlike your inside, outside, DMZ.\\nWell, this gaming company could be somebody\\nthat has people working from anywhere,\\nand probably more of a cloud and innovative company.\\nOn the other hand,\\nour other example will be XYZ University.\\n\\nI bring this example up\\nto be almost the opposite of ABC Gaming,\\nwhere they're more of traditional networking,\\nprobably has an inside, outside, DMZ.\\nYou got all sorts of users bringing\\nGod knows what on the network,\\nfrom any type of, from Android, Apple, et cetera.\\nYou have researchers doing all sorts of random stuff\\nwith all sorts of random IoT and other devices.\\nThe focus of a university, unlike the gaming company,\\nis not going to be about having this service\\nyou're going to buy right away,\\nbut it's more about like bigger focus.\\n\\nLike, maybe there's a multimillion dollar grant\\nthat their researchers need to get.\\nAnd that may require like a CMMC compliance or something.\\nSupporting like the user experience,\\nsupporting the alumni programs.\\nThese are other things that would probably mean\\na lot of value to the university.\\nSo you'll see these examples later in this course,\\nbut basically I'll be looking at these\\nfrom a business goal perspective, like I'm showing here,\\nas well as from a technology goal,\\nand then trying to understand where they're at\\nand build a zero trust program\\nfor both of these organizations.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3959588\",\"duration\":712,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Planning a Zero Trust design:

Once you establish your business goals and rank those,\\nnext we'll be looking at things like technical goals\\nand technical projects.\\nWhen you have top technical goals,\\nthey must align to top business goals.\\nYou can't have a top technical goal\\nthat's not important for the business goal.\\nAnd what's important about understanding this is\\nyou're looking at what projects are being looked at now,\\nor maybe being planned,\\nand your objective should be,\\nwell, how can zero-trust accomplish\\nthese types of goals and projects?\\nIt could be that you have some high-level business ones.\\n\\nSo, for example, zero-trust may be a top technical project\\nor goal, and then you have subsections under that,\\nlike, to accomplish zero-trust,\\none project's going to be modernizing the segmentation\\nor improving how you're doing MFA.\\nBut the whole idea is to list out accomplishments,\\nlist out targets,\\nand say If we can move to a zero-trust architecture,\\nwe can accomplish these types of goals,\\nthese kind of projects.\\nLooking back at our two examples\\nthat later we'll build zero-trust models for,\\nif you look at ABC Gaming,\\nthey're going to have various programs\\nand various projects\\nthat are based specifically on things like their games.\\n\\nSo in this case, we're talking game\\nor application resilience.\\nSo your WAF, DDoS tools, et cetera,\\nare going to be extremely important.\\n'Cause every time the game goes down,\\nevery second it's down, that's lost money.\\nThe user experience.\\nSo the idea of performance is going to be extremely important.\\nSo, yes, you can do security,\\nbut you don't want to have a cumbersome\\nmulti-factor authentication,\\nor a system takes forever for the user to buy something,\\nor the user's just not going to have a good experience\\nand go somewhere else.\\n\\nBackups and redundancy is going to be extremely important\\nfor a company like this,\\nas well as making sure they're meeting compliancy\\nin everything they're doing.\\nSo this architecture has got to be basically redundant\\nand also within compliance,\\nor there's going to be potential problems\\nnot only from a performance perspective,\\nbut also there may be fines\\nand other things that they can be seeing\\nif they are not meeting their required compliance.\\nWhen it comes to the SOC,\\nthe SOC is going to be about not only monitoring\\nfor breaches and stuff,\\nbut also monitoring that the game is being played correctly\\nand that whole brand concept as well.\\n\\nABC Gaming is likely to be very modern,\\nmeaning people can work from anywhere,\\nand developers, contractors, et cetera,\\nare going to be anywhere around the world needing access\\nto potentially very sensitive systems,\\nlike the backend of the game and, you know,\\nthe information and the proprietary stuff\\nassociated with their gaming business.\\nOn the other hand, if we look at the technical goals\\nof our university, they are not going to necessarily care\\nas much about the website going down.\\n\\nThey're probably going to have more of things\\naround the user experience.\\nSo I've seen scenarios with universities\\nwhere, like, they're extremely concerned\\nwith like their cloud-based camera network\\nbecause the idea is they want to make sure that on campus,\\nthat the users feel safe.\\nSo, you know, cloud-based cameras, their alarming system,\\net cetera, is all about user safety for their students,\\nemployees, et cetera.\\nEspecially in the news,\\nthere's been a lot of shootings and other things,\\nthis would lead to these type of technologies being in place\\nas their solution to monitor for such behavior.\\n\\nOther things our university probably cares about\\nwould be maybe eventually being more modern.\\nBecause like other businesses in the university world,\\nit's extremely competitive to try to draw off students,\\nresearchers, et cetera.\\nAnd in a lot of cases when I talk to universities,\\nthey want to innovate on things\\nlike getting rid of textbooks.\\nSo this basically means now you're going to have more iPads,\\nmore IoT devices, maybe you have technology in the cloud.\\nSo the users, when they need to read their books,\\nthey're continuously accessing a book that's online.\\n\\nSo that's going to be continuous network connectivity\\nversus somebody having a laptop or being local\\nand seeing the data there.\\nSo again, different environments, different technical goals,\\nand later in this course\\nI'll show how to take these business goals,\\nthese technical goals, and create zero-trust architectures.\\nAnother requirement that's important to consider\\nis if you have stuff like data sovereignty requirements.\\nData sovereignty means that you have requirements\\nto keep data, applications, and resources within a region\\nor within a country.\\n\\nSo basically there's controls and insurance\\nthat data does not move outside\\nof those required specifications.\\nSo for example, if you're in Europe\\nand you want to use some cloud provider,\\n'cause as I talked about in earlier lessons,\\na lot of security components\\nare moving to a as-a-service offering.\\nSo if you're going to go to an XDR offering\\nor whatever technology we're talking about,\\nand it's going to hold your data,\\neven though it's in the cloud,\\nthat cloud or those systems have to remain in country.\\nIf not, you may have to look at another provider.\\n\\nAnd this is basically another requirement\\nthat may just change your approach\\nto looking at how you want to build\\nyour zero-trust architecture.\\nAnother aspect to consider are compliancy requirements.\\nCompliancy could be many things.\\nFor example, we could be talking about requirements\\nlike PCIDSS.\\nLooking at ABC Gaming,\\nif they're going to allow users to be able\\nto use their credit card to purchase the service,\\nABC Gaming is going to have to be PCIDSS.\\nSo as ABC Gaming says,\\n\\\"Well, we want these kind of technologies\\nin our zero-trust architecture,\\\"\\nthey're going to have to make sure those technologies\\nbeat PCIDSS.\\n\\nAnother example could be looking at CMMC.\\nSo XYZ University may be looking at grants\\nfrom the U.S. government,\\nand CMMC is a USA-based government requirement\\nthat literally takes the NIST guidelines\\nthat are not required,\\n'cause guidelines are recommendations,\\nbut converts them into requirements.\\nSo if XYZ University wants to maintain that grant\\nand request that again next year,\\nas they build the zero-trust architecture\\nthey may have to look at CMMC level one, two, and three\\nto make sure they are meeting those requirements.\\n\\nAgain, there are many compliancy options out there.\\nI have another listed here as SOX,\\nbut there are many things that you may have to look at\\nwith your business to say,\\n\\\"Well these are requirements we need to do.\\nSo as we start looking at technologies and people\\nand processes, we need to adjust things\\nto make sure we are compliant.\\\"\\nOne thing that I've talked about multiple times\\nis the user experience.\\nYou even saw in some of the previous guidelines\\nthat were highlighted,\\nlike the NIST guideline in open group,\\nspecific callouts about user experience.\\n\\nWhat this means is you can't just do security,\\nbut you have to also make sure that the security is modern\\nand doesn't impact the users.\\nSo one thing to think about with this\\nis understanding how the user's interaction's going to be\\nas they go through the platform.\\nOne way of doing this is looking at a tabletop exercise\\nor some kind of like exercise\\nwhere you run the user through it\\nand basically get feedback.\\nIn my personal experience,\\nif you're going to have a zero-trust plan\\nand you're going to execute this plan,\\nthis plan will not be judged on how secure it is,\\nbut it's going to be judged on\\nhow the user sees the security.\\n\\nSo essentially the user experience\\nis going to be feedback to leaders,\\nand that's going to be the outcome.\\nSo if you implement your zero-trust program\\nand users are complaining, you're knocking down servers,\\nadmins are complaining,\\nin the end, it's not going to be a successful program.\\nSo if you want to satisfy the people\\nbehind sponsoring your program,\\nyou really need to focus on the user experience.\\nOther components that have not been covered\\nthat you're probably going to want to think about\\nare the other third-party risks,\\ncommonly referred to as supply chain type risks.\\n\\nWhat this means is, as you acquire technology,\\nas you think about migrating to maybe a cloud offering\\nor some other offering,\\nwhat are the associated risks with that?\\nAnd this is interesting because\\nmaybe you're thinking about using\\na secure access service edge solution,\\nbut then you start thinking about not only data sovereignty,\\nlike where's this solution located,\\nbut is the vendor trusted enough\\nto basically hold your data?\\nDo you trust outsourcing to that provider,\\nor is there potential risks?\\n'Cause in the end if, think about this,\\nyou have a policy enforcement engine\\nthat is basically looking at all of your users,\\nlooking at how they're accessing your crown jewels,\\nif they're compromised by an attacker\\nthat's outside your hands.\\n\\nYou are just basically putting your trust in somebody else.\\nThey get compromised,\\nand now based on their mistake,\\nyou are dealing with the outcome.\\nHow do you validate this?\\nIt's not an easy answer,\\nbut you need to basically ask questions\\nvia the vendors and providers that you're going to,\\nabout how they're meeting security best practices.\\nAnd there are different ways of doing this.\\nOne example would be if you're looking at a cloud provider\\nand you want to understand, \\\"Is this cloud provider secure,\\\"\\nyou can look to see if they're star certified.\\n\\nSo the STAR, or Security Trust and Assurance Registry,\\nis an example of a way\\nwhere they look at this cloud-based service\\nand see if they're meeting security best practices.\\nIn the STAR world,\\na level one is just self-assessment,\\nwhich is not really the most secure or most trusted way.\\nIt's more or less the vendor has taken the STAR guidelines\\nand essentially said, \\\"Yeah, we checked ourselves\\nand we think we're meeting this,\\\" and that's basically it.\\n\\nWhere you get to real star value\\nis when you look at basically level two or level three,\\nor basically not the person self-assessing,\\nbut somebody else is coming in as an expert\\nand saying, \\\"Yep, we went ahead,\\nwe validated that they're running the best controls.\\nWe're going to now certify 'em at level two or level three,\\\"\\nwhere there's continuously monitoring\\nand validation that security is being implemented.\\nThis is the example of a way for you, as a customer, to say,\\n\\\"Well, if I'm going to work with XYZ vendor, I need proof\\nthat there's not going to be risk of a supply chain attack,\\nor risk that you are going to basically have\\nsome type of event that will eventually impact me.\\\"\\nSTAR is just one example.\\n\\nThere are other examples of ways\\nto look at vendors you work with.\\nMaybe it's ISO certifications.\\nBut there are other ways for you\\nto basically talk to a vendor\\nversus just having some sales person say,\\n\\\"Yep, we run the best security stuff,\\\"\\nto actually have the vendor prove\\nthat they are running the best security controls,\\nessentially reducing the risk of supply chain attacks.\\n(frame whooshing)\\nThis basically leads us to my favorite thing\\nI've been showing throughout this course, my heat map.\\nAnd essentially you could use this heat map,\\nor some other heat map,\\nbut these are security capabilities that you can use\\nto basically understand how to be a zero-trust architecture.\\n\\nIn the next section, what I'm going to do now\\nis I'm going to take all these components I've talked about\\nand develop my own zero-trust architecture.\\nI'll work from a flat network,\\nand we'll work all the way through\\nto a secured zero-trust architecture\\nbased on the four principles covered throughout this course.\\nLet's go ahead and look at building\\nthat zero-trust architecture.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2022565\",\"duration\":603,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"From flat and unsecure to Zero

[Instructor] Let's go ahead and work\\nof converting a traditional flat unsecure network\\ninto a more secure zero trust oriented network.\\nNow, there are many ways that you can do this.\\nI'll show some examples now of a thought process\\nof a crawl, walk, run or step-by-step approach,\\nbecause in the end, most organizations are not going to be able\\nto just rip and replace everything.\\nThere's going to be a phased approach.\\nSo we'll start with a flat network, and what does that mean?\\nWell, what we're talking about is you have devices, users,\\net cetera, that are on a network\\nthat basically is all allowing whatever to happen.\\n\\nThere's open communication.\\nSo users can just log into applications\\nor an admin can then log into an application\\nand then SSH to other applications.\\nThe threat is if a breach occurred,\\nthat breach could affect and then laterally spread as well.\\nAlso, the risk like IoT devices,\\nif that was to be compromised, that could be a gateway\\nto lead to other parts of the network.\\nFor users and applications that exist off network,\\nessentially the security operations center\\nis blind to all of this.\\n\\nSo if the SOC has all their tools\\nand monitoring within this flat network,\\nanything occurring out here,\\nunless there's some kind of API or cloud component,\\nessentially the SOC is going to have little to no visibility.\\nThis obviously isn't secure and improvements can be made.\\nSo if you wanted to start with adding security,\\nstep one is going to be establishing some form of way\\nto determine context and risk.\\n\\nSo essentially what we're saying is\\nrather than just having the network being flat,\\nlet's figure out a way to create a trusted\\nand untrusted environment.\\nSo we'll call this the unmanaged or untrusted network\\nand the trusted network and the corporate network,\\nand then you need a way to establish groups.\\nSo the groups could be maybe admins, maybe employees,\\nmaybe contractors, however you want to do it,\\nbut a first phase would be let's figure out\\nwhat should be trusted, and then from there,\\nfigure out policy.\\n\\nYou may start with something simple.\\nMaybe you're going to use MFA and then maybe some cert\\nto prove it's a corporate-issued device, whatever it may be,\\nbut you're going to create these checks,\\nand the idea is if you pass the check,\\nyou could be allowed on this network\\nor allowed on the trusted network.\\nIf you fail the check, by default,\\nyou're denied or put on the unmanaged network.\\nThis is a common first step\\nfrom going from flat and unsecure\\nto a somewhat more secure environment.\\n\\nThis is also a very important stepping stone\\nif you're going to start looking at\\nwhat zero trust talks about,\\nwhich is having a policy enforcement engine.\\nThis is kind of the first stage\\nof that policy enforcement engine\\nthat's going to basically evaluate things\\nand start allowing and not allowing access,\\nand the idea of zero trust is to eventually enhance this\\nmore and more as well as limit your segmentation.\\nSo maybe as you start to phase in this corporate network,\\nphase two or three can be adding micro-segmentation,\\nor in the cloud, leveraging the native cloud segmentation\\nso this system can't talk to this system\\nwithout going through this policy enforcement engine.\\n\\nAlso what we're talking about in this kind of architecture\\nis looking at how devices are being managed.\\nSo this can be looking at things\\nlike desktop and asset management.\\nThis could be looking at things like GRC,\\nyour risk compliance.\\nSo now the SOC is starting to have visibility\\nand understanding of the risk of assets\\nbefore decisions are being made.\\nAnother component that could be used as kind of a sub-step\\nbefore you get to a full zero trust architecture\\nis some kind of like VDI or virtual desktop approach\\nto providing access, and the way this works is\\nyou take a VDI or some solution,\\nput it in the trusted network,\\nand then allow the untrusted devices\\nto connect to the VDI device.\\n\\nSo these devices, whatever the risk may be,\\nwill never have access to the inside network.\\nInstead, you give keyboard access.\\nSo the keyboard exists here,\\nand this system is what's accessing the resources,\\nand maybe you can build this VDI system\\nto follow a more modern zero trust approach,\\nand then from there, you control access\\nvia multi-factor and other aspects\\nto allow or not allow access to this VDI environment.\\nIt's a popular crawl, walk, run,\\nI would say walk phase organizations can take\\nbecause it's something that you can do quickly\\nto start to see zero trust-like outcomes\\n'cause you can control how this is accessing things\\nand then just control how this is being accessed.\\n\\nThis obviously isn't a zero trust solution\\nbecause there's many other components\\nlike cloud that are not being covered,\\nbut it is a way to throw in something to provide something\\nmore than traditional network access controls.\\nOther things to think about is\\nthe concept of securing applications,\\nand there are different ways to go from a crawl\\nto a walk scenario.\\nOne example may be publishing apps in a secure environment\\nusing portals and other solutions.\\n\\nSo the idea is rather than publishing it in the cloud\\nwhere anybody can access it,\\nyou publish it in a secure environment\\nand then control how access is going to that application.\\nThis is also one way to start to move away from VPNs,\\nwhere maybe the traditional way\\nthat applications are accessed\\nis you have somebody VPNing to the application,\\nbut that could be maybe a backup,\\nand instead you force 'em through a front end\\nthat has that policy enforcement component.\\n\\nThere also could be native components,\\nmaybe API gateways, et cetera, that could be leveraged here\\nthat could be turned on that are managed by the SOC.\\nSo when users and applications are being leveraged\\nin the cloud, controls are put in place.\\nOnce you have that foundation,\\na good crawl to walk or speed walk\\nwould be adding more security within these changes,\\nso essentially going from segmentation\\nto maybe more segmentation or micro-segmentation.\\n\\nI talked about earlier in this course\\nhow IoT devices are essentially a higher risk\\nbecause you can't install firewalls, et cetera.\\nSo maybe rather than just having\\na inside network or trusted network,\\nyou start to create networks for different levels of risk.\\nDifferent levels of risk could be different types\\nof IT devices or IoT devices\\nor maybe like legacy, old devices\\nthat can't run modern security tools.\\nAlso, you can look at things like adding additional EDR\\nor endpoint security tools,\\nadding ways to understand better context\\nand risk of those endpoints,\\nsame for servers and same for applications.\\n\\nSo essentially you're doing two things.\\nYou're adding more segmentation and more lockdown\\naround the policy enforcement engine.\\nSo essentially when a user or device\\nwants to access an application,\\nthere are more checks and more policy controls\\nbefore that application is basically allowed or denied.\\nOnce they get to this phase, you're ready to start looking\\nat a true modern zero trust approach,\\nwhich is basically getting rid of this network altogether\\nand moving towards what the NIST Open Group\\nand other guidelines talk about,\\nwhich is having a policy enforcement component\\nthat exists anywhere in the world.\\n\\nSo essentially you're moving to having users, devices,\\net cetera, trying to access either SaaS apps,\\naccess the internet or access the hybrid data center,\\nbut to do this, they have to go\\nthrough this policy enforcement engine\\nupon every connection.\\nSo for example, if they want to go to a SaaS app,\\nmaybe this is going to be a cloud access security broker\\nor CASB or some other solution\\nthat basically is forcing a policy check\\nbefore allowing or denying access.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the internet,\\nregardless of where the user's at, as you can see there,\\nthey can be on prem or they can be at home.\\nDoesn't matter.\\nWhen they try to go to the internet,\\nthey're going to basically go through the security stack.\\nThis could be your traditional next-gen firewalls,\\nIPSs, content filtering, et cetera,\\nand this could be enforced via maybe a SD-WAN solution here\\nand enforced maybe agents over here,\\nbut there's got to be some way to enforce those controls.\\nIf you don't have that,\\nthen if the user's anywhere in the world,\\nthey can just go to the internet.\\n\\nLastly, one way as well to enforce policy\\ncan be putting it here at the application layer\\nor you can have your traditional secure access\\nservice edge solution where the user\\nor device or application connects,\\nand when they want to go to the hybrid data center,\\nwhether on prem or in the cloud,\\nthe policy enforcement engine is able to do its job,\\nvalidate, and then allow or not allow access.\\nThis is a example of migrating\\nfrom a unsecure, untrusted network and taking some steps.\\n\\nYou don't have to take these steps,\\nbut these are just common examples\\nand the common steps I've seen as I talk to organizations\\nthat really don't have a lot of security\\nand are trying to migrate to a zero trust program.\\nYou can't just take a flat network\\nand magically flip it to zero trust.\\nThere are typically these type of steps\\nand thought processes that take place\\nbefore an organization can move\\nto a more zero trust secure end state.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Lesson 7:

There are some critical factors,\\nconcepts you must include in your zero trust plan\\nin order for you to have success.\\nThe first concept that you need to stress\\nis that security is a journey, it is not a destination.\\nYou're not going to become zero trust architected or secured.\\nYou're not going to meet zero trust guidelines and be done\\nbecause things are constantly changing.\\n\\nFor example, if you need a vulnerability scanner,\\nif somebody gives you budget for that and you buy it,\\nyou're not done.\\nEssentially, you've become more mature\\nin the space of vulnerability management,\\nbut now you need to actually deploy,\\nuse the technology, optimize it and so forth.\\nAnd the same applies to a zero trust architecture\\nand the same should apply to your plan.\\nI talked about these concepts earlier in the course.\\n\\nI talked about the cat and mouse game\\nand how the attackers are constantly changing their TTPs,\\ntheir techniques, their tactics and procedures.\\nTherefore, as defenders,\\nyou also need to adjust how you defend.\\nThis means the way that you're deploying zero trust\\nand doing things like breach detection have to also change.\\nAlso, as we all know, technology changes.\\nI talked about in this course\\nthe idea of traditional zero trust principles\\nand then showed various ways to compromise those principles\\nand why things have to adjust.\\n\\nTherefore, things like AI, big data, et cetera,\\nare going to continue to change how this technology works.\\nTherefore, it needs to change how your plan should function.\\nSo right away when you plan this\\nand you talk to your executive sponsor\\nand you're trying to build out a zero trust architecture,\\nit's got to be a journey,\\nsomething that continues to be adjusted.\\nIt is not a destination.\\nIf you sell it as a destination,\\nyou sell it as a final cost of resources,\\nit will work to that point, but eventually you will fail.\\n\\nYou'll create technical debt and, ideally speaking,\\nyou will lack the capabilities that meet modern zero trust\\nbecause you will stay stagnant as change occurs.\\nAs you look at your strategy,\\nthere are some things to think about\\nand recommendations I have that you need to really consider\\nas you start to build your planning.\\nI find when I talk to organizations\\nabout how they did or did not accomplish\\nwhat they wanted to accomplish with their plannings,\\nI find the ones that actually have success\\nhave executive sponsorship.\\n\\nThey basically have looked at things\\nlike business goals, technical goals,\\nand shown how their zero trust journey\\naligns to the business.\\nAlso, it's very important,\\nI find there's success when there's actually clear goals\\nas well as steps that you can track.\\nSo rather than just saying right now we're unsecure,\\nthe end result is being secure,\\nyou actually have a way to grade success.\\nYou can say, here's the crawl, the walk, the run,\\nhere's each step and here's how we grade success.\\n\\nSo you can show that you are accomplishing your strategy\\nas it's being rolled out.\\nIt's very important to understand what success is.\\nIf you just say, we're going to be more secure,\\nthat doesn't really mean anything.\\nThis is where having clear goals\\nand having a way to rank the maturity\\nor rank the success of such goals\\nis going to allow you to show that the work that you're doing\\nis leading to something\\nthat's providing value to the business.\\nFinally, what's important\\nis it's important to understand the real requirements.\\n\\nMeaning you've thought about things\\nlike compliance, data sovereignty,\\nyou've thought about technology that's needed,\\nthe people and process.\\nSo you're not just saying, we need to buy this tool\\nand that's going to help us accomplish zero trust,\\nbut you're more strategic.\\nYou're like, these are all the things that we need\\nand as a result, you're going to have this outcome,\\nwhich that outcome leads to my zero trust strategy.\\nLacking these type of things\\nare going to lead to pitfalls in your planning.\\nIf you don't have the sponsorship,\\nif you don't have ways to track success,\\nyou're not going to have basically a sponsor or funding\\nand, essentially, you're going to be about creating these asks\\nbut you're not going to have the support,\\ntherefore you're not going to be able to actually execute\\non what you want to accomplish.\\n\\nNow, there are many steps you can take\\nas you build out a zero trust journey but, in general,\\nI would categorize most organizations\\nat being either at the beginner, middle,\\nor more advanced stages.\\nThe beginner stages would be basically getting started.\\nThis would be basically looking at like a flat network\\nor a traditional security environment\\nwhere there's like an inside, outside and DMZ.\\nThere may be some controls in place,\\nyou may have multifactor or passwords,\\nbut there's a lot of improvement that could be done.\\n\\nTypically, this stage has or is following\\nsome of the traditional zero trust principles.\\nAnd I showed earlier in this course the risk\\nby just leveraging those principles,\\nsuch as allowing multifactor but then once you do it,\\nallowing that admin or user to have access to everything\\nor have access for a certain period of time\\nversus restricting that access\\ndown to only what should be accessed,\\nhence least privileged access.\\nA lot of organizations\\nmay have some of the principles I've covered\\nand be kind of in this middle point where there is\\na strong multi-factor authentication solution.\\n\\nThere are things like context being evaluated\\nbefore you allow access,\\nthere are also different network segments,\\nbut it could be matured, it could be improved.\\nIf you looked at the last lesson in this course\\nI walked from flat to secure,\\nthis would be that middle stage\\nwhere there's maybe like segmentation for IoT devices,\\ntrusted and untrusted devices,\\nbut it's still not a centralized policy enforcement piece\\nor maybe there's different solutions\\nfor cloud versus on-prem.\\nSo this is where you're looking at,\\nwell, we have some of the components\\nbut maybe we can do some improvements\\nas well as do like a gap analysis\\nfor people, process and technology\\nand basically address where those gaps are at.\\n\\nFinally, you may be in a situation\\nwhere you've done a lot of things.\\nYou have some of these investments\\nand you're at the point of more deploying and optimizing.\\nMaybe you have an XDR platform\\nbut you're not using the SOAR capabilities.\\nSo it's, yeah, we have the SIEM\\nbut we can improve the SOAR area.\\nAnd again, this may make sense to look at like a heat map.\\nLook at, well, what do you have,\\nwhat's effective, what's not effective,\\nand try to turn some of the reds and yellows\\ninto yellows and greens.\\nWhen it comes to understanding what you have\\nto figure out if you are in the beginning, middle,\\nor late stage, it's important to understand what you have\\nand that really is going to be a gap analysis.\\n\\nAnd there are different ways of doing this.\\nFirst off, from the business and technology goal analysis\\nyou need to be able to create a list.\\nYou need to be able to rank this.\\nYou need to have this validated with leaders,\\nespecially potential sponsors for your program.\\nYou need to understand what those limitations are\\nbecause if you have a sponsor\\nthat doesn't have power or resources,\\nin the end when you make these asks of what you need,\\nyou're obviously not going to have what you need\\nto actually execute.\\nIt's important to understand what's on the truck.\\nThis gets into the idea of heat mapping.\\n\\nThis is where you can get an understanding of what you have,\\nwhat would make sense to be part of your journey,\\nwhat needs to be basically replaced,\\nor what's actually missing.\\nIt's very important if you want to appeal to leaders\\nto think consolidation, which is a way to do cost savings,\\nand time to value.\\nThese are two important concepts.\\nConsolidation is maybe you have 10 vendors\\naccomplishing the greens,\\nand by consolidating to five vendors\\nyou're saving X amount of dollars\\nwhich allows you to use that money\\nto fund your zero trust program.\\n\\nTime to value is the reality of seeing the value\\nfrom what you plan to do.\\nFor example, you may say,\\nwell, we're going to implement these technologies\\nbut if it takes three years, it just may be too long\\nbefore your executive sponsors and the organization\\ncares to see value from what you're trying to do.\\nSo maybe if it takes three years\\nbecause you need to train people or hire people,\\nthere may be other options to understand\\nand be able to improve the time to value.\\nMaybe if you outsource you could shrink the time to value\\nand basically be able to provide an end result quicker.\\n\\nAn example could be this.\\nLet's say that in your zero trust architecture,\\nyou have three new technologies\\nand either, A, you can spend three years\\nlearning how to configure and install those technologies,\\nor you can spend two months outsourcing it\\nto the vendor who will come in and do the installation,\\nwhich you only need to do once.\\nAnd then from there they'll train your users,\\nand then from there\\nbasically reducing a three year time to value\\nto a six month to year time to value.\\nWhen it comes to evaluating your available resources,\\nthere's heat mapping to understand the available technology,\\nand then there's tabletop exercises\\nto understand your people and process.\\n\\nThe way it works\\nis you work through hypothetical examples of scenarios\\nand then evaluate how your people and process would respond.\\nIn my experience,\\nI tend to see two general types of tabletop exercises.\\nEither there's an executive version or a technical version.\\nIn the executive version,\\nyou're more business and outcome oriented.\\nFor example, if we're looking at a ransomware outbreak,\\nyou would look at the who and what's responsible.\\n\\nYou look at costs associated\\nand see if you have the right processes\\nand see if you have the right leadership.\\nWhere in a technical version of a tabletop exercise,\\nyou look at the specific procedures.\\nDo you have these specific tools?\\nAre they configured the right way?\\nIs there maybe like consultants\\nor other things to be brought in\\nto help improve these tools and these processes?\\nBut ideally, this is how you can understand\\nthe available resources when it comes to people and process.\\n\\nSo if you're building a zero trust architecture,\\nyou can figure out, well, maybe we need to hire somebody,\\nmaybe we need to outsource, maybe we need some training\\nand other people and process oriented resources?\\nIn the end, when you think about building\\nyour zero trust architecture,\\nyou must consider the three components,\\npeople, process and technology.\\nThe technology is going to be your heat mapping.\\nThe people and process is going to be\\nunderstanding if you have the people power\\nto power the technology you want to use,\\nas well as is there ways to look at automation,\\nintegration, et cetera to improve the process.\\n\\nMy experience, these two are ideal\\nto test with the tabletop exercise\\nwhere this is ideal to test with a heat map.\\nSo recommendation is\\nif you're trying to evaluate where you're at\\nand understand where you want to go,\\nit's ideal to plan heat mapping and plan tabletop exercises\\nto really understand your current state.\\nSo then you can plan where we're at\\nand understand where you want to go.\\nNow there are different options\\nwhen it comes to the people and processes.\\n\\nFirst off, there is the in-house option,\\nwhich is basically doing things yourself.\\nAnd there are pros and cons to in-house.\\nSome of the pros is you control the assets.\\nYou can create training programs\\nso if somebody works within your organization\\nand they're looking for a career path,\\nthey can ideally understand,\\nor I have this role but this can lead to some better role.\\nAlso, when it comes\\nyou have all that control.\\nAnother option may be to outsource it\\nand there may be values and reasons to do this as well.\\n\\nFor example, rather than trying to train your people,\\nyou can use some third-party organization\\nthat deals with that topic within other organizations.\\nSo you almost get\\nlike a built-in threat intelligence and expert to come in.\\nThere maybe other reasons,\\nmaybe from a time to value perspective\\nit just makes more sense.\\nSo it may take a lot longer\\nfor you to hire somebody and train somebody\\nthan to bring in an expert\\nwho's already ready to rock and roll.\\nThe third option is hybrid.\\n\\nThis is probably the most common where you're taking,\\nkind of taking the best of both worlds.\\nSo for example, maybe for the mundane, basic tasks\\nlike tier one and tier support, you outsource that,\\nbut if something is escalated,\\nthen you have your in-house experts take it over.\\nThat's an example of building both.\\nI've seen in scenarios\\nwhere an organization doesn't have the expertise.\\nMaybe you start off with using outsource experts\\nand then you have your internal people\\nlearn from those experts\\nand eventually start to move to a in-house environment.\\n\\nSo you start to reduce the amount of outsource experts\\nas your in-house experts\\nlearn from those options that you have,\\nwhether it's experts in XDR, experts in incident response,\\nor whatever it may be.\\nIn my personal experience, there's always going to be\\nsome form of outsource experts though.\\nTypically this is known as a IR or incident response\\nor like some kind of retainer.\\nIn the end, there is no organization out there\\nthat wants to have a breach\\nand when asked, who do you call when you have a breach?\\nThey have no phone number to call\\nor no experts to reach out to.\\n\\nMy experience, every organization out there\\nwants to have a on-hand on-call expert\\nin the event of the worst day\\nwhen there's some breach and stuff.\\nSo in the end, there'll be some outsourced experts.\\nThe question is how much, does it make sense\\nfor you to outsource versus use in-house.\\nAs I mentioned,\\nwith it comes to using in-house or outsource,\\nthere's always pros and cons.\\nThese are examples of the benefits\\nof keeping things in-house.\\nSo anything from keeping the data internal,\\ntailoring the requirements, because typically\\nwhen you outsource the specific agreements,\\nso to go outside those agreements\\nare going to require new contracts.\\n\\nIf it's in-house, you don't have to deal with those.\\nHowever, there are also some challenges.\\nSo the training, the time to value,\\nthese are other examples of challenges\\nthat can lead to you not seeing the value\\nof keeping the resource in-house.\\nSame applies to in-house versus external.\\nThere may be values and there may be reasons\\nwhy you don't want to use in-house versus outsourcing.\\nOutsourcing, again, is typically contract-based.\\nSo if you want to have a more open option\\nas well as have more controls,\\nyou're probably going to want to keep things internal\\nversus outsourcing.\\n\\nHowever, keeping things internal\\nis going to require likely a lot more costs\\nand it's going to have a longer time to value\\nbecause you need to train and mentor these resources\\nto be effective.\\nNow there are some trends that I'm noticing in the market,\\nand basically what's happening is there is a shift\\nwhen it comes to the options for managed service.\\nSo traditionally managed service\\nused to be consulting groups.\\n\\nSo you would go to a big company\\nthat doesn't care about the vendor,\\nbut more or less would say we can manage your technology.\\nSometimes they have a list of trusted vendors,\\nso they're going to say, for your XDR,\\nwe require you to have Splunk or QRadar or LogRhythm,\\nor maybe there is no requirements,\\nbut essentially they're more vendor-neutral\\nand they're more focused on that.\\nSo I call this basically\\nthe service provider-based managed service.\\nHowever, there's been a heavy shift in the vendor market\\nto say, well, we realize that we want to sell our technology,\\nbut the challenge with this\\nis the customer doesn't have the people and process\\nto be able to support the technology.\\n\\nSo for example, I am selling a XDR platform,\\nso like SIEM and a SOAR.\\nNow the organization\\ndefinitely wants to have this technology,\\nbut they don't have the people.\\nThey basically, they have a small IT staff\\nor they just don't have the training for this\\nso even though they want to buy from this vendor,\\nthey have to go to the service provider\\nbecause they don't have the people.\\nTo overcome this,\\nwhat's happening is a lot of the big security vendors\\nare offering a version of managed service.\\n\\nSo what they're saying is,\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3963528\",\"duration\":859,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Executive sponsorship and mission

One important and highly recommended step\\nyou should take as you build out your zero trust journey\\nis finding the right executive sponsor or sponsors.\\nThese are the people essentially\\nthat are going to provide support and funding for your program.\\nTo find the right sponsor,\\nyou need to think about who controls things like funding\\nas well as, very importantly, who has power?\\nBecause when it comes to security\\nand it comes to change, there needs to be an authority\\nto enforce the change as well as\\nthere needs to be some kind of repercussion\\nif the rules are not followed.\\n\\nAnd if you don't have an executive sponsor\\nto enforce that change,\\nthen users are just not going to follow the new rules.\\nYou also need to think about what is success,\\nbut not regarding what you think success is,\\nbut what the sponsors think is success.\\nThis may be looking at user experience,\\nthis may be looking at other pieces of the business goals,\\nbut this is a business focused conversation.\\nSo it may not be obvious at first\\nwho you should target for your executive sponsor,\\nbut it's extremely important to have this.\\n\\nWithout the right support,\\nyou will not have a successful zero trust journey.\\nI've talked a lot about\\nlooking at business goals and technical goals\\nand turning a technical conversation\\nto a business conversation,\\nand you may be wondering,\\n\\\"Well, how do I actually apply that to my environment?\\\"\\nWell, the way to think about it is,\\ncreate those business goals\\nand more or less align the IT goals to the business goals\\nand then start to apply your environment to the model.\\n\\nSo for example,\\nlet's say that you're looking at protecting an asset.\\nNow, there are formulas for this.\\nIf you go for your CISSP certification,\\nthey'll give you formulas like this\\nthat try to give you a ballpark number.\\nBut for this scenario, we'll look at\\npreventing an asset loss as being, let's say, a data center.\\nSo you can go to your leadership and say,\\n\\\"In order for our business to run,\\nwe need to store our data here.\\nAnd if the data is lost\\nor that asset is no longer available,\\nI believe it's going to cost us X amount of dollars\\nper hour, per day, per week.\\\"\\nYou can figure out whatever that number may be,\\nand you probably can generalize it just\\nto get your point across.\\n\\nThen you can say, \\\"Well, in order for me\\nto prevent the asset from being lost\\nor at least reducing the risk, I need some IT services\\nor SOC services to support the program\\nthat's going to protect this asset.\\nSo if the business goal is to protect this asset,\\nthe technology goals are going to be,\\nI need a vulnerability management program\\nbecause I need to know\\nIf there isn't a vulnerability management program,\\nthis asset will likely start having vulnerabilities,\\nexposing it to risk of being compromised.\\n\\nI'm also going to need a monitoring program.\\nSomeone or something is going to have to look at this system\\nand be able to look for attackers\\nand look for breaches or other forms of threats.\\nAnd then if something is detected,\\nwe need to have a way to respond.\\nWe can't just monitor for threats and not have a response.\\nThere needs to be an actual incident response program.\\\"\\nSo essentially what you're saying is,\\n\\\"Leaders, if you want to protect this asset,\\nI need to have these programs\\nwithin my security operation center.\\\"\\nThen you get into the actual specifics\\nand you can say, \\\"All right,\\nin order to have a vulnerability management program,\\nI need to have some tools.\\\"\\nMaybe I need a vulnerability management\\nsolution like a vulnerability scanner,\\nsomething from Rapid7.\\n\\nMaybe I need a tenable solution.\\nI also may need some kind of compliance solution.\\nMaybe you also need a GRC tool\\nbecause part of your goal is\\nto meet some specific compliance.\\nWhen it comes to monitoring,\\nthis is where you can justify the investments in XDR.\\nSo maybe I need my sim source solution.\\nMaybe I need an EDR solution deployed\\nto feed my XDR platform.\\nLastly, for incident response,\\nmaybe this is where you justify some outsourcing.\\nYou say, \\\"Well, my team doesn't have the skill sets.\\n\\nLet's call Mandiant.\\nLet's call some trusted provider,\\nso if an incident was to occur,\\nsince we don't know how to respond,\\nwe can bring in a trusted partner\\nand be able to remediate any of these scenarios.\\\"\\nSo what I've done here is,\\nrather than just asking for stuff,\\nsaying, \\\"All right, here's my laundry list.\\nI need a vulnerability scanner, we need an IR agreement,\\nI need an XDR platform.\\\"\\nWhat I'm doing is I'm saying,\\nhere's a way to turn this into a business conversation.\\n\\\"This is the asset, this is the amount\\nof money this asset is worth,\\nor this is the cost it would be if the system was to go down\\nand in order for us to reduce the risk of that happening,\\nthese are the services I need\\nand these services require this,\\nnot to mention, probably people and process.\\n\\nSo I need this budget in order for this to happen.\\\"\\nThis may be high level,\\nbut essentially it's a way\\nto take technical conversations, career to business.\\nSo you can be very tactical when it comes to\\nasking for resources from your executive sponsor.\\nAnother key component is being able to define success.\\nI talked about that in previous lessons,\\nbut you may be wondering,\\n\\\"Well, how do you actually do that?\\\"\\nIn the world of cybersecurity, we tend to use maturity\\nas a way to rank systems.\\n\\nSo rather than saying you have something\\nor don't have something,\\nyou have typically some level of maturity.\\nThis is extremely important\\nbecause non-technical people are going to think of investments\\nas a destination, which we've talked about,\\nsecurity is a journey, not a destination.\\nFor example, if you ask\\nfor a vulnerability management program, they may say, \\\"Okay,\\nhere's budget to go buy Rapid7,\\\" for example,\\ngo buy some solution.\\nBut just by buying the solution,\\ndoesn't mean that you have now\\na vulnerability management program.\\n\\nEssentially what may be happening is,\\nyou've gone from nothing.\\nSo we'll say this is zero maturity.\\nAnd by acquiring a technology, maybe you're at a one.\\nMeaning you have something,\\nbut it's not even deployed or not even being used.\\nI've seen scenarios where\\norganizations have purchased the right tools,\\nbut they become shelfware because they're never deployed.\\nMaybe to prove maturity, you get to a level two\\nto show that it's actually being used.\\nHowever, just because you're using the solution\\ndoesn't mean it's fully mature.\\nFor example, maybe you're doing ad hoc scanning.\\n\\nSo randomly, you scan a subnet or something.\\nThat's not the best use\\nor the most effective vulnerability management program\\nbecause if you scan every Monday at 9:00 AM,\\nwhat happens if something comes on the network Tuesday?\\nThat means it's going to be a whole week\\nbefore it's actually evaluated,\\nand who's to say that it's even going to be evaluated?\\nSo again, maturity is a way to kind of think about\\nhow you can communicate defining success.\\nSo what you can do is,\\nyou can look at heat mapping your technology\\nand also doing a tabletop exercise\\nand kind of ranking the maturity of those services\\nand then define, \\\"Okay, we have these capabilities\\nand these services\\nand they are ranked at a one, three, four, and five,\\nand our goal is to do a zero trust architecture\\nby maturing these various areas.\\\"\\nAnd you have to be realistic.\\n\\nYou can't just say, \\\"We're going to make everything a five\\\"\\nor everything mature.\\nYou got to really think about\\nhow these services would function.\\nThis also allows you to think about this component here,\\nwhich is your time to value,\\nand this could maybe justify outsourcing\\nusing a managed service\\nor something versus doing everything in house.\\nWhat's key is you got to be realistic.\\nIf you make the success too far in the future\\nor just out of scope,\\nwhere you're just never going to get there,\\nyou're never going to show value, and in the end,\\nyour program's going to not look like it's being successful.\\n\\nThere are different ways to show maturity.\\nOne example could be used in the COBIT model,\\nand that was kind of the example I was showing where,\\nif I'm buying a vulnerability management tool\\nto enhance my program,\\nnot having anything would be the zero.\\nIf I buy something,\\nfor example, procurement signs off,\\nI get a solution.\\nLeadership needs to understand you're not running\\na fully mature vulnerability management program.\\nIf anything, if it's initially deployed,\\nnot even really being used,\\nyou're really at more on the first lower stage.\\n\\nSo we can say maturity of one.\\nWhen you get to the middle maturities,\\nwhat's typically happening is you're actually using\\nthe solution and defining processes.\\nSo typically when you get to the three maturity,\\nwe're talking about playbooks,\\nwe're talking about repeatable processes.\\nAnd then as you get into the higher maturity stages,\\nwe're typically talking about optimizing.\\nSo at this point, we're not only using the solution,\\nbut we're enabling automation.\\nWe've created playbooks.\\nWe're basically doing lessons learned\\nand constantly making the service more effective.\\n\\nSo the equivalent of vulnerability management would be\\nwe've integrated the vulnerability management tool\\nwith other tools.\\nWe're constantly evaluating.\\nSo anytime something is on or off network,\\nit's continuously being evaluated\\nand we're continuously leveraging what we're finding\\nto improve that vulnerability management program.\\nThat would be considered an end goal\\nand what you can do is build in different steps\\nto get to that end goal.\\nSo as you're asking for investments,\\nit doesn't seem like you're constantly going back\\nto the well to say,\\n\\\"Well, I need more,\\\" without any justification.\\n\\nMaybe the first ask is,\\n\\\"I need a tool to go from zero to one.\\\"\\nAnd then the second ask is, \\\"I need the people and process.\\\"\\nSo I need some training, I need some other types\\nof support to get here.\\nAnd then later maybe the ask is, \\\"I need to bring in experts\\nto help me optimize.\\\"\\nOr maybe, \\\"I need other tools, like API tools,\\nto help me do some DevOps\\nand start to optimize and automate.\\\"\\nAnother important step beyond getting a sponsor is\\nalso establishing a mission plan.\\n\\nBasically, you need to define what is in scope\\nand what is out of scope.\\nSo this allows you to, essentially, in a short document\\nor short statement, be able to explain the purpose\\nof what you're trying to accomplish.\\nYou need to explain its impacts.\\nSo are you impacting the entire organization,\\nwhich hopefully you're doing,\\nor maybe you're doing a smaller zero trust program\\nwith the hope of expanding it to other parts\\nof the organization.\\nIn this mission plan,\\nthis also allows you to define the budget.\\n\\nThe budget is important because\\nif you have your executive sponsor,\\nyou can basically say, these are my sponsors\\nand they've agreed to allow this budget.\\nSo as you build each phase\\nand you basically define your success criteria,\\nthere are no surprises.\\nA wise man told me once surprises are for birthdays,\\nthey're not for business.\\nYou definitely don't want any surprises\\nas you build out your plan.\\nAlso, it's extremely important to come up with a timeline,\\nand this is where you can think about\\nin-house versus outsourcing,\\nas well as defining those steps for success.\\n\\nI highly recommend to think about checkpoints\\nso you can go back and see if you are actually defining\\nand achieving the goals that were originally called out,\\nor if there are other factors that are causing the program\\nto be delayed or skewed from what you see\\nas defined as success.\\nOther things to think about is the associated risk.\\nIt's possible that\\nparties that are looking at your plan are going to be concerned\\nthat you're going to break things\\nor by adding more security or changing things,\\nyou're going to upset users and basically cause the risk\\nto how operation is currently running.\\n\\nIt's best to proactively address these risks.\\nSo essentially, there's a little pushback\\nto what you're recommending within your program.\\nFinally, for people to truly understand what you're doing,\\nyou may need include any documentation or diagrams,\\nand it's probably best to not only have your own diagrams,\\nbut reference some guidelines,\\nsuch as the guidelines we covered,\\nthe open group guideline and this guideline\\nor any other guideline that's out there.\\nI recommend that you come up with a ready to build list.\\n\\nSo essentially what you think about is,\\nthese are the things that need to be accomplished\\nbefore we start to move forward with a zero trust program.\\nSo if you wanted a checklist, this would be it.\\nI would ask, you think you're ready to build?\\nDo you have your executive sponsor or sponsors?\\nDo you understand, have you heat mapped,\\nwhat your tools are?\\nDo you know what the gaps are?\\nDo you understand what the budget is that's needed in order\\nfor you to fill in those gaps?\\nHave you aligned your objectives\\nto the business and technical goals?\\nDoes your executive sponsor agree with that?\\nWhich is extremely important\\nbecause you may think you know the business\\nand technical goals, but it's more important\\nthat your executive sponsor agrees\\nto what you define as such goals.\\n\\nHave you thought about all of the other things?\\nSo things like compliance, data sovereignty, et cetera.\\nHave you considered any other\\npotential challenges you're going to have to your program?\\nDo you have a defined timeline\\nwith checkpoints so you can show success as you move along?\\nDo you know everybody being impacted,\\nwhich essentially I call the customers.\\nSo that can be your actual customers you sell to,\\nbut it could be the employees, it could be anybody\\nthat's going to be impacted by this program.\\nAnd finally, have you established the relationships\\nand evaluated your vendors and partners and contractors?\\nBecause things like supply chain risk,\\ndata sovereignty risk, et cetera, may exist\\nand you may need to make sure\\nthat you have the right vendors versus starting\\nto cure technologies and then find that something\\nthat is being used won't meet such compliancy.\\n\\nI highly recommend for you to take this\\nand have some version of this list or check boxes\\nand go through this and make sure you meet this\\nbefore you start moving to a build.\\nOnce you do this, you're ready\\nto start executing on your zero trust program.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2022566\",\"duration\":1019,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Use case 1: ABC

We covered a lot of concepts in this course.\\nLet's now look at some examples of taking action.\\nLet's look at how we can take an organization,\\nidentify its current state,\\nand build a zero trust plan\\nto move them to a more secure program.\\nOur first example we'll look at is ABC Gaming.\\nABC Gaming could represent an organization similar to yours\\nbut one that's probably pretty good at security,\\nso they're in that middle stage of security,\\nand in their mind, to get to zero trust\\nis moving to more of a optimized\\nand modern state of security.\\n\\nSo to kind of look at ABC Gaming,\\nif they're evaluating their business goals,\\nit's likely the game itself, which makes money,\\nis going to be one of the top goals.\\nIt's also very likely that the way the game is sold\\nand the sales process and everything associated\\nwill also be a top goal.\\nThese are going to be how the company makes money.\\nImprovements to making money\\nwould likely be up there as well.\\nAnd then after that, we'll get into the requirements\\nto keep the game running.\\n\\nSo maybe in this use case,\\nABC Gaming allows for credit cards to be used\\nwhen purchasing the game,\\nhence things like PCI DSS must be met.\\nFinally, the lower business goals,\\nwhich are still important,\\nbeing innovative, keeping employees happy,\\nthat kind of stuff.\\nSo if I'm building a zero trust program,\\nI'm likely going to want to focus on these things,\\nkeeping the game online, growing the offering,\\n'cause these are top business goals,\\nand these are things I would relate\\nto the ABC Gaming executives.\\n\\nDefining technical goals\\nmeans making sure that I'm looking at projects and programs\\nand making sure they align to the business.\\nSo if the business' top goal is to keep the game online,\\nit's very likely things like resilience tools,\\nyour web application layer firewalls,\\ndenial of service tools are going to be top technical goals\\n'cause these are needed in order to keep the game online.\\nWhen it comes to performance,\\nprobably look at the ISP throughput,\\nas well as making sure there is a plan B\\nor backups if the game goes down\\nare also critical to ABC Gaming.\\n\\nOnce you get through that,\\nif compliance is a mid-tier piece,\\ncompliance would also be a mid-tier technical goal.\\nAnd then finally, when it comes to innovating,\\nsuch as allowing people to work from anywhere,\\nthat would match those business goals.\\nSo this is an example,\\nmaybe more business goals, more technical goals.\\nThere may be things outside of security as well\\nthat would be on this list,\\nbut it's ideal to define this as you start to think about\\nwhat your zero trust plan would be.\\n\\nABC Gaming probably has other considerations.\\nThings to understand\\nis they probably have a pretty decent budget.\\nThey probably are very brand focused,\\nso part of the zero trust program\\ncould be that this is going to improve the user experience,\\nmake things more secure,\\nreduce the risk of negative impact to the brand.\\nThey're probably very innovative,\\nso you start talking about cloud, cloud-based security,\\nthey're not going to push back on that\\nbecause they're kind of used to that technology.\\nIf they're an online game,\\nit's very likely they have a global footprint,\\nso this may lead to things when it comes to compliance\\nlike data sovereignty and other things\\nas they look at selling the game in other countries.\\n\\nIt's very likely you're going to have developers\\nand other people around the world\\nthat are going to have access to the critical code,\\nwhere if that code was ever leaked or compromised,\\nthat can lead to basically huge negative impacts\\nto the brand, potentially even taking out the game.\\nFinally, it's very likely that downtime\\nis going to be always a top conversation\\nbecause if the game is down, they're unable to make money,\\nso things like downtime and redundancy\\nwould also be important considerations.\\n\\nWhen it looks at the customers\\nor who's involved in this ABC Gaming architecture,\\nyou need to think about these different experiences.\\nWhat's going to be the experience\\nas you change things for the developers?\\nHow about the end users, the gamers?\\nOr maybe, like, contractors or employees?\\nWhat do they do? How do they function today?\\nAnd how are these changes going to impact these personas?\\nIt's extremely important to consider this\\nbecause in the end, when you start to pitch this to leaders\\nthese are the changes that are going to happen,\\nthese are the areas where you're going to see pushback.\\n\\nThey may say, \\\"Well, this is fine,\\nbut our developers aren't going to be able to do their work.\\\"\\nOr, \\\"This is going to slow down development,\\nwe're not going to make our goals,\\ntherefore we can't do what you're asking.\\\"\\nSo we've looked at ABC Gaming,\\ndefined business and technical goals,\\nand looked at other requirements.\\nNow we need to apply our fundamental zero trust principles,\\nwhich are always verifying explicitly,\\nmaking sure that we provide least privileged access\\nas well as dynamic segmentation\\nwhen they access whatever resource,\\nand then having the SOC assume breach\\nso they're able to monitor baseline\\nand basically identify any type of risks.\\n\\nLet's go ahead and look at how we could potentially do this\\nfor ABC Gaming.\\nSo there are many assumptions we can make\\nabout ABC Gaming's current state.\\nYou know, they're not going to be\\nin the initial flat, unsecured state\\nbecause this is likely to be a very innovative company.\\nIt's very likely we could assume, at their current state,\\nthat they're probably using some cloud provider.\\nThat could be Microsoft Azure,\\nit could be Amazon or some other provider.\\nSince the game being online is so important,\\nit's very likely things like high availability, performance,\\nthe certain compliancy\\nto allow for a credit card spending, et cetera,\\nall these things have already been met,\\nso these don't have to be part of the zero trust program\\nbecause these things are already kind of part\\nof how ABC does business.\\n\\nSo we can make these assumptions.\\nAlso, the environment,\\nit's likely to assume to have some existing security.\\nThere's probably a gaming environment\\nwith a front end, a developer piece\\nwhere they can test new beta versions, et cetera.\\nThere's probably going to be some form of segmentation.\\nIt's likely that there's going to be\\nsome vulnerability management program,\\nso somebody's monitoring to make sure that people\\naren't compromising the game, making adjustments.\\nLike, it should be assumed that there's a fundamental\\nsecurity operations center with services,\\nso the idea is looking at what they currently have\\nand making adjustments\\nto meet the current modern zero trust guidelines.\\n\\nThe best way to do this\\nis to understand the different personas.\\nSo you may say today,\\nthe way people access the game is they go to some front end.\\nMaybe they have to go to an agent,\\nand they install the agent,\\nwhich then basically allows them to access the game.\\nMaybe the game has a website they go to,\\nor maybe they use a console\\nand the console then checks in with the website\\nand provides updates to that.\\nBut however the game is being provided,\\nthere's basically likely a gaming environment\\nwhere developers need to have more access.\\n\\nThey need to actually get to the back end and make changes\\nor maybe build those changes\\nand then push those to the actual environment.\\nYou're also probably going to have people\\nthat maybe don't have the ability to change,\\nbut they need to basically monitor the game.\\nThere are many other personas.\\nand we got to think about how change\\nwill impact these architecture.\\nSo let's look at the four principles.\\nFirst, Principle 1\\nis looking at always verifying explicitly.\\n\\nSo it's very likely you would be doing heat mapping\\nand doing tabletop exercises to understand the current state\\nof how basically users and devices are being validated.\\nSo it's very likely there's probably already some form\\nof an identity management program and MFA,\\nbut maybe improvements can be made.\\nMaybe from a user experience,\\ngoing passwordless for the developers would make sense.\\nMaybe adding more context-based tools,\\nmaybe locking down the developers\\nto having to use corporate-issued devices,\\nso we're going to add things like certificates\\nand issue laptops\\nand validate that they're not using personal devices.\\n\\nBut you want to think about\\nwhat is the end state for verifying explicitly\\nand create basically a maturity model.\\nMaybe today, the maturity of certain tools are mid stage,\\nand to get to higher maturity,\\nyou're going to need additional capabilities\\nby buying some other technology from a vendor\\nor maybe getting unlocking capabilities\\nwith licenses and resources and what you currently have.\\nAlso, things like profiling or maybe certificates\\nor maybe needing to look at things like additional websites\\nor IoT devices and other things\\nthat need to be profiled and understood.\\n\\nThe idea is you want to establish the who and the what,\\nyou want to understand the risk,\\nyou want to be able to understand the context,\\nso as you start to think about enforcing policy\\nthat you're first are establishing this\\nto then be used in your second and third phase,\\nwhich is, based on the who and the what,\\nwe're going to allow this specific type of access.\\nIt's very likely you have these components.\\nYou're just basically understanding what you have\\nand creating changes or tuning to make these better.\\n\\nStep 2 and 3 is going to be\\nlooking at the principle of least privileged access\\nas well as dynamic,\\nleast privileged access as well as dynamic segmentation.\\nIt's probably assumed that ABC Gaming\\nis going to have some form of segmentation.\\nMaybe they have certain VLANs or ACLs,\\nor if they're in the cloud, in this case,\\nthey have certain defined segments.\\nThe idea would be is,\\nrather than just allowing microsegmentation or staying here,\\nthe next step may be to prevent this type of access,\\nthe lateral movements,\\nand start looking at a zero trust model,\\nwhich is if things need to move from here to here,\\nthey must first go through\\nsome form of policy control engine.\\n\\nSo if I'm a developer, I can't go to one place\\nand then basically start SSHing around.\\nI have to continuously go through\\na policy enforcement engine,\\nso that could be the change.\\nThere could be other things though.\\nMaybe that right now you have a VPN and you're looking at,\\nwell, there's a risk associated with this model.\\nMaybe this is the gap when it comes to the heat map,\\nthat you need to change this component,\\nwhere in the first principle,\\nyou're using your existing technology,\\njust making some tuning and adjustments,\\nthis can actually be the gap in this example.\\n\\nWhat do I mean?\\nWell, maybe we can say in this example\\nthat the way they do it now\\nis a developer uses a VPN concentrator\\nto get access to the back end.\\nThe way this would work\\nis the developer maybe installs an agent\\nor goes to a clientless-based VPN\\nthat provides an IP address.\\nSo they go in\\nand they have an IP address to the inside network.\\nThe challenge with this is by having an IP address,\\nthey can also see what else is within that range.\\nAlso, they possibly could do things\\nlike use an SSH application and start pivoting around\\nto other parts of the inside network.\\n\\nThis is a risk\\nbecause let's assume that this is not a developer,\\nand let's make the assumption that one day\\nan evil hacker is going to basically compromise a user account.\\nThat hacker would use that account\\nto log into the inside network, get an IP address,\\nand start scanning the environment\\nto understand what other resources are there,\\nand then maybe use SSH or something to pivot around.\\nSo essentially the hacker is acting just like a developer.\\nSo the idea is you can talk about this being the risk\\nand that in your new zero trust model,\\nyou're going to address this risk by making some changes\\nor basically asking for some resources.\\n\\nThese could be the specific risks.\\nYou can say, \\\"We need to get rid of developers\\nand other admins from having IP addresses.\\\"\\nThere's no reason for that. They're accessing a resource.\\nLet's give them access to the resource and move on.\\nNow, there are different ways to do this.\\nMaybe you can start talking about a Citrix environment\\nor some kind of, like, proxy environment\\nwhere the proxy is here, the developer goes to the proxy,\\nand then the keyboard access is provided through the proxy\\nversus the developer getting a VPN\\nand getting an IP address on the inside.\\n\\nThere are different ways to address this concern,\\nbut this would be one that needs to be addressed\\nin order to move to a more secure architecture.\\nIt's very likely you also need to remove the ability\\nto communicate between these systems,\\nso something like SSH being allowed\\nwould be a violation of modern zero trust.\\nBasically, you want to talk about these kind of principles,\\nidentify gaps in these principles,\\nand then from there,\\nbuild what the new environment will look like.\\n\\nNow, there are different ways\\nto address this new environment\\nor address Principle 2 and 3.\\nOne way could be using, like, that Citrix\\nor VDI environment,\\nbut another way can be using\\nlet's call it a reverse proxy-based solution.\\nMaybe it's a SASE-based solution,\\nbut something that basically says\\ndevelopers and any other user must come through this system,\\nand then from there, they're given a specific tunnel access\\nto whatever service they want.\\nAnd that service, even if SSH exists,\\nthey won't be allowed to pivot.\\n\\nInstead, they must go through this proxy\\nin order to get access to other systems.\\nThis is the kind of scenario that removes that IP address\\nand starts to get to a zero trust, least privileged scenario\\nbecause you're only validating and allowing access\\nthat is based on that specific need.\\nThis is an example of creating an old architecture\\nand new architecture\\nand being able to show that there's a challenge\\nto the current way that admins,\\nin this example, VPN is being allowed,\\nso you're enforcing a better approach\\nto basically provisioning resources.\\n\\nNow, again, there are many ways of doing this,\\nbut in this hypothetical example,\\nthis would be one example of showing\\nhere is existing technology\\nthat doesn't meet current guidelines,\\nso rather than making tuning,\\nwe're talking about making adjustments\\nor adding a new solution,\\na new approach to basically provisioning access.\\nThe final principle is about assuming breach.\\nSo now we're talking about\\nthe security operations center within ABC Gaming\\nand saying, \\\"Well, in order for us to do our job,\\nwe need to make sure that first,\\nthe proper segmentation is there.\\n\\nSecond, if we're going to acquire\\na new policy enforcement engine,\\nwe need to have access to that\\nand be able to monitor for violations.\\\"\\nThose can be violations of, let's say, user behavior,\\nso they're basically doing a lot of password resets.\\nThis could be the monitoring tools\\nwithin these environments,\\nand if we're seeing malicious activity,\\nwe're able to basically be notified\\nso we can have a response.\\nBut essentially talk about how the SOC would work\\nin this new environment.\\n\\nAgain, there are many ways\\nto accomplish these four principles,\\nbut I was to consult with ABC Gaming,\\nthis is how I would do it.\\nI would look at the business goals, technical goals,\\ncreate all the assumptions,\\nconvert that all into a mission plan,\\nand then define the four principles.\\nI'll look at how are we validating the who and the what,\\nwhat kind of context is available,\\nwhat is being used today, and what could be improved?\\nMaybe you're doing multifactor,\\nbut you want to start using passwords or something.\\nSo you'll create all those objectives\\nand have that as part of your zero trust plan.\\n\\nThen I'll look at Principle 2 and 3\\nand specifically look at violations of those principles.\\nSo in this example, the administrators having VPN access\\nand then being able to SSH\\nthroughout the internal cloud network would be a high risk,\\nand that's where we would say, \\\"We need to change things.\\nIn order for us to move to a zero trust architecture,\\nthis is a better approach.\\\"\\nAnd show a new approach\\nthat basically locks down access to least privileged,\\nand it's dynamically segmented.\\nYou only get access to what's being provided.\\n\\nAnd then finally, address the security operations center,\\n\\\"In order to reduce the risk of breach,\\nthese are the kind of capabilities\\nthat will be fed into the security operations center\\nso they can monitor this new architecture.\\\"\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3965240\",\"duration\":1105,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Use case 2: XYZ

Let's look at another example.\\nIn this case, we're going to review XYZ University.\\nUnlike ABC Gaming, which is probably more modern,\\nmore innovative, probably has budget,\\nprobably in a decent security state,\\nbut when it comes to moving to a Zero Trust architecture,\\nhas some slight tunings, adjustments that are needed,\\nsomething like XYZ University may be a lot less secure.\\nMaybe they have less budget,\\nso they have more steps needed\\nin order to meet current Zero Trust guidelines.\\n\\nJust like with ABC Gaming,\\nthe first step is going to be looking\\nat the business and technical goals.\\nFor a university such as XYZ University,\\nit's very likely safety for students and staff\\nis going to be a top priority.\\nRecently in the news there's been a lot of shootings\\nand other things that just put this\\nin the front of most university leadership minds.\\nSo that's going to be a top objective, safety.\\nAlso top, revenue-generating concepts\\nare also going to be top business goals.\\n\\nSo for XYZ University, it's possible they have a lot\\nof researchers that get multimillion dollar grants.\\nSo not only is XYZ University funded through education,\\nbut it's also funded through research grants,\\nwhich will make these a very important business goal.\\nThis is important to understand because,\\nif security impacts the researchers,\\nthis may kill your Zero Trust program.\\nThey literally may say, \\\"Well, if we are going to add security\\nand the researchers complain,\\nthen we are going to be out of business.\\\"\\nSo you need to be able to address that conversation.\\n\\nIt's very likely XYZ University is in a competitive market,\\nsince there's lots of universities out there,\\nso they're going to want to be innovative.\\nThis is going to allow the ability to attract more students\\nand increase revenue, which an outcome of that is also\\nwith innovation allowing for off-site campus\\nor basically remote learning.\\nFinally, there may be other programs to consider,\\nlike alumni programs or specific compliance\\nthat need to be met.\\nMaybe the researchers need to meet CMMC\\nin order to have access to certain grants.\\n\\nSo today it's lower,\\nbut as CMMC becomes a higher requirement,\\nthis would probably raise up on the list\\nbecause now we're impacting potential budget\\navailable to XYZ University.\\nTechnical goals need to align with the business goals.\\nSo if safety is a top priority, any technology,\\nsuch as cloud-based cameras or campus alarms,\\nare all going to be top priorities\\nbecause they directly align to safety.\\n\\nWhen it comes to being innovative,\\nit's very likely innovation means more cloud.\\nSo improving cloud resources, availability,\\nthat type of stuff,\\nis likely to be a pretty high technical goal\\nbecause that is needed in order to be innovative.\\nThe same for the off-campus learning,\\nit's probably leading directly\\nto growth in cloud businesses.\\nAnd then finally, other innovations,\\nlike eliminating textbooks,\\nare probably going to be part of the technical plans.\\nSo the idea is you want to define the business technical goals\\nand relate the Zero Trust program to these goals.\\n\\nOther things XYZ University is probably going to be considering\\nas they look at their new Zero Trust architecture\\nis the available budget.\\nUnlike ABC Gaming, it's very likely XYZ is going to be slower\\nto adopting technologies, as well as have different shifts\\nin budgets depending on how they make their revenue,\\nwhether it's one time a year\\nthey're given their research grants,\\nor when students register for classes.\\nIt's very likely they're going to be focusing\\non what makes money.\\n\\nSo if the researchers and students are\\nwhere the revenue's coming from,\\nthose are going to be heavily, heavily critical\\nto how this Zero Trust program is going to look.\\nBecause if you make changes that impact these\\nin a negative manner, the program is not going to fly.\\nWe can look at their footprint,\\nit's probably a statewide-based footprint,\\nmeaning that like, unlike the gaming company\\nthat has a global footprint, they don't have to be concerned\\nabout international regulations and other things.\\n\\nNow as they grow their off-campus market,\\nmaybe this will eventually grow in importance,\\nbut it's likely now that,\\nif we're talking about a Zero Trust program,\\nthose kind of non-statewide concerns\\ncould be considered later in the program's maturity.\\nMaybe there are compliance requirements,\\nbut there's probably going to be other interesting components\\nthat need to be considered.\\nOne example of that would be things like freedom of speech,\\nwhere we have universities that have students\\nthat are afraid that Big Brother, Big Sister is watching,\\nwe talk about security,\\nso they're not going to want to have limitations.\\n\\nSo like a corporation, like ABC Gaming can easily say,\\n\\\"We're going to deny gaming, pornography,\\ngambling, and other resources,\\\" where at XYZ University,\\nthey're probably not allowed to do that.\\nThey're probably more focused on freedom of speech.\\nSo maybe you can monitor for certain things,\\nbut you can't enforce.\\nAnd then finally, there's probably everything under the sun\\nconnected to the network.\\nI mean, you're going to have researchers innovating\\nwith new devices, things that have never existed before.\\nSo we're talking about specific IoT risks\\nthat you can only imagine could exist\\nbecause the researchers are not even delivering\\na final product, they're actually testing\\nand messing around with various technologies.\\n\\nAlso, students are going to bring whatever they want.\\nIt's very unlikely that XYZ University\\nis going to provide issued devices to each student.\\nIt's very likely the university is going to allow\\nfor students to bring their own device.\\nLooking at XYZ University,\\nthere's going to be various types of customers.\\nThere's probably going to be the researchers\\nand how they function, teachers, students, and et cetera.\\nLooking at this environment,\\nmaybe ways to consider what modern looks like\\nas you start to think about the changes you want to recommend.\\n\\nFor example, maybe the researchers tend to use high compute\\nand the university is buying laptops, and desktops,\\nand servers, and providing that to researchers.\\nThis could be a point where you can say,\\n\\\"Well, we should maybe move to a cloud-based solution,\\nand this is the reason why.\\\"\\nSo you start thinking about the personas\\nand think about ways to improve their environment,\\nreduce cost, and make the university more secure\\nand in a better environment.\\nThese are various examples of personas,\\nbut this is what I would do if I was trying\\nto create my business plan for XYZ University.\\n\\nNow we need to look\\nat applying our core Zero Trust principles.\\nThose are always verifying explicitly,\\nproviding a form of dynamic network segmentation\\nwhile enforcing least-privileged access.\\nAnd then finally allowing the XYZ University SOC\\nto be able to monitor, assume breach,\\nand identify when a threat occurs.\\nJust like with ABC Gaming, there's likely\\ngoing to be existing architecture at XYZ University.\\n\\nMaybe it's not as modern as ABC Gaming.\\nThey're not going to be completely flat and secure.\\nIt's very likely a university like this\\nis going to have some segmentation,\\nbut it'll be more traditional.\\nSo it's likely to have VLANs and ACLs.\\nSo for example, they have building one,\\nand if you're on the first level, you connect to VLAN 100.\\nYou go to level two or floor two, you go to VLAN 200.\\nAnd what, floor three is VLAN 300.\\nHowever, if you go to building two, you connect to VLAN 110,\\nfloor two is VLAN 210 and so forth.\\n\\nSo from a network administration point,\\nif I see an IP address with a 210 VLAN,\\nI know that that user is connected\\nto that part of the network.\\nI've talked about some of the deficiencies in this\\nbecause if you're giving IP addresses to like admins\\nand there's sensitive stuff here, there's risks.\\nBut essentially, this is probably\\nwhere the architecture sits at today.\\nThey probably have some access control,\\nbut it's probably limited.\\nIt's very likely they have like a student network\\nthat's very open and maybe an administrative network.\\n\\nMaybe they hide the SSIDs.\\nThey probably have some form of access control though,\\nit's not like they have nothing.\\nSince they're looking to be innovative,\\nsince they're looking to provide off-campus courses,\\nit's very likely they're using some cloud usage.\\nWhen I talk to universities in the state,\\nit's also very likely they're using a couple clouds.\\nMaybe they have some stuff in Amazon, some stuff in Google,\\nsome stuff in Microsoft Azure,\\nand there's pretty much no controls\\nover how these resources are being used.\\nIf a researcher wants to light up something in Amazon,\\nthey probably can go ahead and do that,\\nas well as if they're plugging something on the network,\\nthey probably can go ahead and do that.\\n\\nEssentially, anything can exist on this network.\\nThis is my assumptions for this university,\\nwhich come from consulting\\nwith real universities around the world.\\nWith that being said,\\nthe environment probably looks something like this.\\nYou have students, researchers, admins, et cetera,\\nand some of them are off network\\nand some of them are on campus.\\nIt's very likely a university like this\\nhas separate solutions for these scenarios.\\n\\nSo they have their applications and data center,\\nand they're going to have their firewalls\\nand security tools for this.\\nHowever, when it comes to the applications\\nthat exist in various clouds, Amazon, Azure, et cetera,\\nthey probably have different solutions, or maybe not.\\nMaybe they've gone to Palo Alto, or Fortinet, or somebody,\\nand acquired their on-prem firewalls.\\nBut then they've said, \\\"Well, we got to secure over here,\\\"\\nand were sold virtual versions of the same firewall.\\nThen they had to buy a firewall manager\\nthat basically allows them to see\\nand enforce policy across both environments.\\n\\nOr maybe they have native available firewall capabilities,\\nbut if they're using like two clouds, for example,\\nthat would be one administrator dealing\\nwith let's say the Google stuff,\\nand then one administrator dealing\\nwith let's say the AWS stuff.\\nThen they have their on-prem firewalls as well.\\nSo it's very likely there's some silo\\nand segmented solutions.\\nA user on network going off network\\nprobably requires certain security tools\\nin order to access something on network.\\n\\nMaybe a VPN is needed, or an agent is needed,\\nwhere if they go into the cloud,\\nthey probably could just go directly to that cloud.\\nSo XYZ University probably has some security,\\nbut it's probably more traditional.\\nAnd the idea is we want to move them\\nto a more modern Zero Trust architecture.\\nTo do this, I would recommend step zero.\\nRather than trying to apply principles to this,\\nwhich means if you do this, you're probably having\\nto create a Zero Trust architecture for the off network,\\nand then create another architecture for the on-prem network\\nor trying to more or less create one solution\\nand then use APIs at integration to make this thing work.\\n\\nA better approach would be looking at a way\\nto collapse all the resources.\\nSo essentially, following modern security,\\nget rid of the idea of on and off campus.\\nSo there is no more inside and outside network.\\nBasically, these users can be anywhere in the world,\\nand these resources are always available,\\ndoesn't matter if they're on-prem or not.\\nHow do you collapse this?\\nSo what do I mean by collapsing this?\\nWhat we need to do is look at a way\\nto look at these resources,\\nwhether they're in the cloud or any cloud,\\nor if they're on-prem,\\nand turn them into one point of access.\\n\\nThere are many ways to do this.\\nI'm not a data center architect engineer,\\nbut if you talk to any data center architect engineer,\\nthey can talk about hybrid environments\\nwhere you cloud connect the on-prem applications,\\nso basically this environment appears as one application.\\nI can be a user,\\nand I can be anywhere in the world and connect.\\nIt doesn't matter where it exists,\\nit always appears to be in the cloud.\\nMaybe you are migrating the application to the actual cloud.\\nMaybe it's kind of a cloud connection\\nwhere essentially the application exists in both areas,\\nand wherever you make changes, those changes are duplicated.\\n\\nAnother approach can be using a secure access service edge,\\nor SASE solution, which uses some kind of bridging tool.\\nYou have a virtual tool here and virtual tool here,\\nand those pump it into the SASE cloud environment.\\nHowever you want to do it,\\nwhat would make sense for XYZ University\\nis not to change everything, but figure out a way,\\nin the least impactful way, to collapse this.\\nAnd this could be various forms of ways of doing it.\\n\\nThis would be the first conversation.\\nRather than trying to just change security,\\nfirst we need to remove this idea of inside and outside\\nso we're creating one Zero Trust solution.\\nOnce we do that, we can start looking\\nat the actual first principle,\\nwhich is always verifying explicitly,\\nbecause now we know that wherever the asset is,\\nthey're connecting to one resource,\\nit doesn't matter if it's on or off network.\\nAnd then we go back to our list of tools\\nthat we've covered throughout the course.\\n\\nWe can look at how XYZ University\\nis doing multifactor authentication, identity management.\\nHow are they dealing with IoT devices?\\nAre they using proxies or are they using applications?\\nDo we need to have certificates involved?\\nBasically, look at what they currently have,\\nsee if it's modern, see if there's improvements\\nto that user experience\\nor application connection performance,\\nand make sure that those meet the latest guidelines.\\n\\nOnce we've done this,\\nwe then move to principle two and three,\\nwhich is how do we control access\\nto this collapsed environment,\\nas well as making sure there's segmentation involved.\\nWe've covered in this course,\\nthere are different ways of doing this.\\nOne way can be some kind of agent-based solution.\\nOne way can be a network-based solution.\\nMaybe it's SD-WAN where the on-premise network\\nis forcing it through a central point,\\nwhile if you're in the cloud,\\nthat central point exists anywhere in the world,\\nlike a SASE solution.\\n\\nOr maybe the applications themself act\\nas that policy enforcement point.\\nBut essentially, there needs to be\\nsome policy enforcement point.\\nSo once we verify the explicitly, we can then say,\\n\\\"Based on what we know,\\nwe're going to provide single access to this environment.\\\"\\nBut when they need access to something else,\\nthey're going to go through the same process again.\\nSo there's not this one-time access, getting an IP address,\\nand then being able to pivot around the environment.\\nInstead, there is no IP address.\\nYou're basically being provisioned single points of access,\\nhence least-privileged access.\\n\\nOne example we'll look at, maybe the Zscaler model,\\nwould be looking at providing agents\\nfor researchers and admins,\\nor maybe for students that are on network,\\nthey would use like a SD-WAN approach.\\nThe on-premise network would be forced\\nthrough the Zscaler environment via a SD-WAN connection.\\nFor off-prem students, maybe you use a client\\nor application-based control where the student has\\nto go to a website,\\nand that website will be basically the control point\\nto check the who and the what before you provision access.\\n\\nIf we're using the Zscaler example to connect the on-prem\\nand off-prem applications to collapse this,\\nyou would be deploying some kind of Zscaler appliance,\\nvirtual appliance, to get the on-prem stuff in the cloud,\\nas well as within each cloud,\\nsome kind of virtual appliance.\\nSo in the end, when the researchers, students, et cetera,\\nare connecting to the Zscaler network via this proxy,\\nthat proxy is bridging the access through these connectors.\\n\\nThat's again, one way that this could be done.\\nAnd what's interesting about that approach is\\nwe're not asking XYZ University to change everything.\\nWe're allowing them to maintain their hybrid environment,\\nhave their on-prem resources\\nand have their application resources,\\nor just forcing the access through this SASE environment,\\nand connecting each of these into that SASE environment.\\nBut again, that's just one way to do this.\\nBut basically, I would be addressing with XYZ University,\\nhow do we consolidate and collapse everything\\nto one entry point,\\nand then enforce policy with whatever solution.\\n\\nFinally, we would look at the security operations center,\\nand say, \\\"Based on this new model,\\nwhat are the capabilities the SOC can use\\nto monitor for breaches?\\\"\\nThis is going to include their identity solutions.\\nYou want to reduce the risk of that attack vector\\nwhere a admin's account is compromised\\nand then the attacker could remotely access\\nand pivot around the network.\\nBut also, this introduces concepts\\nlike user endpoint behavior analytics,\\ncreating baselines, et cetera.\\nAnd you can look at what XYZ University has today\\nand say, \\\"In this new model, here's new telemetry,\\nhere's new areas of focus you can add\\nto the security operation center\\nto ensure that this environment is secure.\\\"\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Lesson 8: Build Your Own Zero Trust

All right, you made it to the end of the course.\\nNow it's time to summarize all the key points.\\nFirst, we need a definition,\\na summary of understanding Zero Trust.\\nIn short, Zero Trust is a security model\\nthat assumes every user, device,\\nand network request is untrusted.\\nSo basically there is no inherent trust\\nwhether you're an administrator or an employee.\\nAlso we have the point,\\neven if it originates\\nfrom within the organization's network,\\nmeaning there is no inside or outside network.\\n\\nBasically people work from anywhere,\\nfrom home, the office, et cetera,\\nare going to have the same level of trust,\\nwhich means they're untrusted.\\nI also covered various principles\\nand I melted them down into four key principles.\\nPrinciple one was all about continuous authentication,\\nbut there's a lot of sub-components to this,\\nbecause authentication\\nis authenticating the who and the what.\\nSo this could be things like multifactor authentication,\\nit could be the what, like certificates\\nto make sure it's a corporate-issued device, et cetera.\\n\\nAlso, I talked about context,\\nthings like location, time,\\nlike, \\\"Why is Joey logging at 3:00 AM\\nor logging in from China when he lives in the USA\\nEastern Standard Time?\\\"\\nAlso, this could mean risk.\\nRisk can be, \\\"Is this device\\nor does this resource have the latest updates?\\nIs it running the right software?\\\"\\nLike, for example, antivirus or EDR.\\nAll that is essentially what's being evaluated.\\nAnd based on what's being evaluated,\\nprinciple two and three combined\\nare a policy-like enforcement engine\\nthat provides least privileged access,\\nso only the access needed for that specific session\\nas well as dynamic segmentation,\\nmeaning once you have that access, it is segmented.\\n\\nSo you can't for example,\\naccess a system and then pivot to another system.\\nYou must go through this policy enforcement engine again\\nto access the new resource.\\nLastly, the force principle\\nwas all for the security operation center.\\nEverything around assuming breach,\\nso all the tools around monitoring all this,\\nall the tools for looking for malicious activity,\\nbehavior, things like UEBA, user behavior analytics,\\nas well as things like what I covered in the course,\\nattack vectors and attack paths,\\nattack paths being things like stolen credentials\\nand the fear that even though you have the best defense\\nand depth security in the world,\\nif a trusted administrator's account's compromised,\\nthe attacker can then pivot right through the security,\\npotentially own your network.\\n\\nSo all those concepts fall into the assumed breach.\\nNow, one key thing with Zero Trust that I talked about\\nor any security concept is that it's a cat and mouse game\\nand that things are constantly changing.\\nWith Zero Trust, I talked about traditional Zero Trust\\naround the 2010 to 14 timeframe\\nand I showed how those specific principles\\nwere okay at the time,\\nbut today would fail and I gave specific examples\\nof bypassing those Zero Trust requirements.\\nThis is why Zero Trust concepts continue to change\\nand follow modern security recommendations.\\n\\nThe guidelines that are published\\ntend to have new iterations\\nor new guidelines as new technologies\\nlike cloud and AI are being introduced.\\nWith that being said, I believe these four principles\\nshould and likely maintain being the principles,\\nbut the concepts behind the principles\\nis what's going to change.\\nFor example, principle one, always verifying explicitly,\\nwhat will change is more modern ways to basically do this.\\nSo from the multifactor authentication,\\none prime example is moving to, like, passwordless,\\nso basically getting rid of passwords\\nusing facial recognition technology\\nand other ways to simplify\\nand improve validating the people.\\n\\nAlso things like validating the devices,\\nvalidating the applications, validating APIs,\\nall that will continue to change as technology matures.\\nOther things like context,\\nunderstanding the who and the what\\nand where it's located and the time,\\nall those things are kind of being done today\\nand likely with big data and baseline technology,\\nthere's likely to be more improvements.\\nFor example, if you see something connecting\\nand it's connected 8,000 times around the world,\\nbut when it connects to you, it's doing something different,\\nthat would be an example of taking advantage of big data\\nwhere you're able to immediately look at this thing\\nand see how it behaves around the world,\\nwhich there's some of that happening today, but not a lot.\\n\\nBut that would be like a futuristic type technology\\nto add a new form of context.\\nAnd then lastly, risk.\\nRisk will continue to get better\\nas security platforms have integrations,\\nthey integrate with vulnerability scanners\\nand MITRE's way to look at, like, risk\\nand those kind of concepts.\\nSo it's likely we're still going to always verify explicitly,\\njust how we do it will change.\\nAnd if you do not adapt, you'll create technical debt.\\nIn my personal experience, I find a lot of organizations\\ntend to not keep this up-to-date.\\n\\nSo they say, \\\"Oh, we have multi-factor authentication,\\nwe have actor directory,\\\" it works,\\nand they'll forget about it for a handful of years,\\ncreating technical debt.\\nSo when they see some new innovation around identity,\\nfor them to turn on that feature,\\nfor example going passwordless,\\nthey have to rebuild their infrastructure,\\nbecause they just have too much technical debt.\\nThe second and third principle are interesting.\\nSecond being the least privileged access,\\nwhich will likely maintain being what it is.\\nBasically however you can do it,\\nmake sure you provide only the access needed\\nto do what is being requested.\\n\\nSo in short, that concept will likely hold out for time.\\nHowever, dynamic network segmentation\\nis likely going to continue to change\\nas security and technology changes.\\nCloud providers, your Amazons, Azures, et cetera,\\nare constantly changing how they run computes.\\nSo initially it used to be a lot of virtual systems\\nand then now you get into, like, code as a service\\nand other concepts which may need\\ncertain types of segmentation that are not available today.\\nBut as these technologies are being used,\\nnew forms of segmentation will be needed.\\n\\nAnd in the end, the idea would be is to make it dynamic\\nto ensure that when you provide the access,\\nthat things are properly segmented.\\nSo it's likely to see various innovations.\\nI would say not as much on the network side,\\nbut more on the cloud and SaaS side to see new innovations\\nin the dynamic network segmentation market.\\nLastly, the breach market\\nwill probably have the most change.\\nThis goes back to the opening of this course\\nwhere we talked about the cat and mouse game\\nwhere basically as the attackers\\nchanged their TTPs, techniques, tactics,\\nand procedures, the defenders need to adapt as well.\\n\\nThe same holds for identifying breaches,\\nmeaning as you identify these new attack behaviors,\\nyou need a way using the three things\\nI talked about in the course, using either the signatures,\\nusing the behavior or the anomaly approach\\nto basically identify those breaches.\\nSo this technology is always going to change\\nand it's up to you to basically\\nlook at how you detect breaches,\\nwhat your SOC uses and keep that up-to-date,\\nmore or less, keep it modern.\\nTo validate the concept of the course,\\nI didn't just show Zero Trust best practice.\\n\\nI reviewed two popular guidelines.\\nSo first, I reviewed The Open Group's guidelines,\\nI showed their definition of Zero Trust\\nand I went through their principles,\\nwhich they had a ton of principles.\\nIn the end, I melted them down\\ninto the four fundamental principles\\nthat I teach in this course.\\nAnd then I reviewed The Open Group's architecture.\\nTheir architecture was pretty simple.\\nPretty much you have users, devices, applications,\\net cetera, trying to access resources.\\nBefore you apply Zero Trust, that axis basically comes in\\nand there's various sorts of risks\\nsuch as pivoting around within these segments\\ninside the resource areas.\\n\\nSo rather than doing that, the idea was to introduce\\nsome form of security policy enforcement points\\nwhere basically that is what's going to validate\\nthe who and the what.\\nThat's what's going to check for context.\\nThat's what's going to check for risk.\\nSo for example, it's going to validate this is Joey\\nand that that's Joey's corporate-issued computer\\nbased on a certificate.\\nAnd by the way, it knows it's me,\\nbecause I'm using MFA, for example,\\na multifactor authentication.\\nIt's also going to see well, on the system, what's the risk?\\nIs the system running the latest updates?\\nDoes it have antivirus, et cetera?\\nAlso, what's other context I should know about?\\nWhere's this connection coming from?\\nWhat time of day is it happening, et cetera?\\nAnd based on all this information,\\neither I will allow or not allow access\\nto whatever resource I'm trying to access.\\n\\nAnd then when Joey needs to access something else,\\ngo through the process again\\nand do not allow cross system access.\\nYou must go through the policy engine.\\nTo keep this policy engine up-to-date,\\nthere are resources like threat intelligence, big data, AI,\\net cetera to help feed this.\\nThen you have your security operation center\\nthat's responsible for monitoring\\nthis entire infrastructure.\\nSo they would use your SIEM, SOAR, XDR platform\\nas well as monitor all the various tools\\ninvolved with the architecture.\\n\\nYou also have your governance tools\\nand automation tools, your SOAR tools,\\nsecurity, orchestration, automation, response.\\nThese are designed not only\\nto make sure things run effectively\\nbut make sure that they meet compliance\\nand also make sure you can do things like automate\\nto make it as effective as possible.\\nAnd then lastly,\\nyou have your traditional security components,\\nso your EDRs, asset protection tools,\\nthings to make sure that the system itself\\nbefore it's even being accessed is not being breached.\\nThis in short is The Open Group's architecture.\\n\\nAnd what I did in the course is I also broke down\\neach of these sections into capabilities.\\nSo you convert it into a heat map\\nand actually take this general\\nOpen Group architecture around Zero Trust\\nand use it as a resource\\nto build your own Zero Trust architecture.\\nI also reviewed the NIST view of Zero Trust\\nand I've specifically looked at the 800-207 architecture.\\nLike with The Open Group, I went through the principles,\\nmelted them down into our fundamental\\nZero Trust principles that I teach in this course.\\n\\nAnd then I pulled up this architecture,\\nwhich at first may seem different\\nfrom The Open Group's architecture,\\nbut really it's very similar.\\nYou have your subject and system,\\nor short, things trying to access things or resources.\\nBut to do that, there is a untrusted and trusted network.\\nAnd to get to the trusted network,\\nyou must go through this policy enforcement point.\\nNow they broke down the policy enforcement point\\ninto a couple sections,\\nbut the whole point is this thing\\nis going to validate that this is the who or the what.\\n\\nSo this is Joey, for example, using again,\\nlike, an MFA or something, validate the system,\\nmaybe it's a corporate-issued device\\nbased on having a certificate, maybe validating context.\\nSo where is this located, what's the time?\\nAnd things like risk,\\nwhich is is this system have the right things installed\\nand a virus et cetera?\\nNow in this system it shows on the left,\\nother factors that can help keep the decision\\nor policy engine up-to-date with what's going on.\\nYou got your threat intelligence being fed in,\\nsecurity activity logs, maybe updates in compliancy\\nand then risk could be brought in\\nby the CDM management tool.\\n\\nOn the right are, like, required components\\nto make this thing work.\\nLike, how do you validate the subject's identity\\nif you don't have an identity management system?\\nSo that is pooled or needed in order to do that.\\nAnd then from the security operation center,\\nwhich wasn't shown in this architecture,\\nbut there's obviously a security operation center,\\nthey're going to use tools like their SIEM, SOAR, XDR,\\nand activity logs to monitor what's going on.\\nOther components will be like if your PKI system\\nto validate servers are not using self-signed certs,\\nthat there's some form of trust\\nand also whatever policies are created\\nby the security operations center.\\n\\nSo like with The Open Group, in short,\\nsomething must go through a policy engine\\nin order to access the resource\\nand they cannot be basically axis within the axis.\\nYou must go through this system.\\nI broke this thing down into capabilities.\\nI even in this section gave examples\\nof vendors that provide such capabilities.\\nSo you're able to once again look for those capabilities,\\ncreate a heat map and turn this NIST 800-207\\ninto something you can use\\nto build your Zero Trust architecture.\\n\\nIn this course, I went through two scenarios.\\nI worked through ABC Gaming and XYZ University,\\nbecause two are kind of different.\\nOne is more modern,\\none is probably more ahead in the way they're doing security\\nthan the other regarding where they're at\\nand then what they're trying to accomplish.\\nBoth have different business models, different focuses,\\nand I did that by design,\\nso you can get an idea of,\\nwell, how do you do things like understand\\nbusiness and technical goals?\\nHow do you build a story\\nto try to find the right executive sponsor or sponsors?\\nAnd how do you more or less plan out\\nyour Zero Trust architecture based on the available data?\\nI talked about personas\\nand I talked about identifying potential risks\\nlike, for example, having a developer\\nand with traditional VPN security, the challenge of saying,\\nwell, this developer can go to a VPN concentrator,\\nget an IP address and within the IP address access a system.\\n\\nBut the risk is that once you have an IP address,\\nyou can more or less ping\\nand identify other systems within the network\\nas well as use tools like SSH to ping around the network.\\nI talked about this being a violation,\\nbecause if you have Johnny Attacker over here\\nand they compromise the developer's accounts,\\nthe activity would be the exact same thing.\\nIt would be somebody compromising the network\\nor accessing the network and then getting IP address,\\ndoing port scans\\nand then eventually pivoting around the network.\\n\\nSo rather than doing that, I talked about Zero Trust.\\nBest practice is having some kind of\\npolicy enforcement engine that's centralized.\\nIn the second use case, I talked about step zero,\\nbut if you have multiple resource sections\\nwith separate things, best practice is to collapse those,\\nso it can say this is basically Amazon as an example,\\nand this will be Microsoft Azure\\nand you have your on-prem, let's say,\\noh, this is a cloud provider,\\nso this can be Google and then an on-prem one.\\nSo you have four different ones.\\nYou don't want to create four different Zero Trust policies,\\nit's ideal to collapse 'em.\\n\\nAnd I gave examples of doing that.\\nLike, one example was using a connector\\nbetween the cloud provider, which is very common,\\nand the on-prem and doing some kind of connection.\\nSo they seem as one system.\\nI gave another example of using like a Zscaler solution\\nwhere you install, like, a virtual appliance\\nthat basically has one-way communication\\nand it connects each of these\\ninto a centralized environment.\\nSo in the end the idea is you just need to connect\\nto the centralized environment,\\nthis is called SASE, secure access service edge.\\n\\nBut this will then validate\\nand then provide that single access.\\nBut from the user's point, it's seen as a single access.\\nSo there's no right way\\nwhether you're using cloud connections\\nor some kind of SASE solution.\\nBut step zero was the collapse of the architecture.\\nStep one was to then create\\nthat centralized policy enforcement point\\nwhich could exist at really three points,\\neither as an agent,\\nso something installed on the end user.\\nSo wherever they're at in the world,\\nthey're being forced to go through this, the point.\\nOr some kind of cloud-based one,\\nlike a SASE solution that can exist somewhere in the world\\nand, like, even your networks can use something like SD-WAN.\\n\\nAnd basically with SD-WAN, when you plug in the network,\\nit will force it through this cloud-based stack of security.\\nOr lastly, it can exist at the actual application layer.\\nSo when you try to connect to the application,\\nyou go to a website, et cetera,\\nit will then be the enforcement point,\\nbut however you do it,\\ncollapse it and have that enforcement point.\\nAnd then from there, to access something,\\nyou must go through the enforcement points\\nand go through the principles.\\nPrinciple one, being able to validate the who and the what,\\nthe context, the risk.\\n\\nPrinciple two and three based being able\\nto then provide access but only least privileged access\\nand then dynamically segment.\\nSo you can't pivot around.\\nSo if you want to go to the second connection,\\nyou must have that single connection established again.\\nLastly, I talked about the third principle,\\nsuggesting that as you build this,\\nthink about the security operation center\\nand what tools are needed to assume breach,\\ni.e. be able to monitor for malicious activities,\\nunusual user behavior and so forth.\\n\\nAnd my goal for you\\nis to have actionable next steps from this course.\\nAnd one important next step is being able to heat map.\\nI show this heat map multiple times in the course,\\nand I'm not saying this is the heat map you must use.\\nWhat I am saying is you should use\\nsome kind of heat map like this.\\nIn my example heat map, I have a focus on the user,\\nbecause in the end, as I called out in the course,\\nthe success of many security projects\\nis based on the user experience,\\nnot how much risk is being reduced.\\n\\nI talked about common security capabilities\\nthat would exist on a laptop, desktop, et cetera.\\nSo things like your encryption\\nor your host firewall, EDR.\\nSince best practice for Zero Trust\\nis collapsing the resources into one section,\\nI collapsed the data center.\\nSo I don't care if it's Amazon, Azure, cloud, on-prem,\\nhowever you do it,\\nin the end, it should be seen as one resource.\\nI talked about the various capabilities\\nthat could exist within that resource.\\n\\nThings like resilience with DDoS and WAF,\\nor your EDR and other software\\nand security applications you would install.\\nI separated SaaS, software as a service,\\nbecause that's you outsourcing everything to a provider,\\nwhich means you're going to have limited amounts\\nof controls of what you can do.\\nThere are unique scenarios\\nlike cloud access, security broker that apply to this space,\\nbut again, you don't have as much control\\nas you do with your data center,\\nhence there's limited security capabilities.\\n\\nI also separated IoT,\\nbecause IoT essentially is the exception.\\nIoT could be a refrigerator, IoT could be anything,\\nbut the idea is you don't have the ability\\nto basically control something\\nlike you would with something you own.\\nSo you have to basically do three key things,\\nprofile to understand really what it is,\\nscan it for vulnerabilities and risk.\\nAnd then if there is a high risk,\\napply some form of segmentation.\\nI talked about data security as being a separate thing.\\nI also talked about this being a common challenge\\nfor many organizations because data can live everywhere.\\n\\nIt can live on the users, it can live in SaaS,\\nit can live in the data center, it can live everywhere.\\nTherefore it should have its own focus,\\nits own lifecycle management.\\nAnd then lastly,\\nI talked about the security operations center, or SOC,\\nand all the tools that would likely exist there.\\nI cover topics like XDR\\nand other concepts that a security operation center\\nwould need in order to meet the assumed breach\\nprinciple of Zero Trust.\\nNow, one fundamental concept for this course\\nis helping you be successful\\nin building a Zero Trust architecture\\nand basically implementing your Zero Trust journey.\\n\\nI find that there were four key things to think about\\nas you want to ensure success.\\nFirst, I highly recommend and talked about gaining\\nthe right executive sponsor or sponsors.\\nAnd here my language, the right one,\\nbecause you want somebody that has power and authority\\nas well as they can give you the budget you need.\\nSo you're going to be talking about making changes.\\nAnd if there's somebody without power\\nthat can help you enforce those changes,\\nyou're likely not going to be able to have success.\\n\\nAnd then when it comes to budget,\\nyou need somebody that can actually back up your needs,\\n'cause you're going to be creating change,\\nthere's going to be required resources,\\nso you need a sponsor that can make that happen.\\nSecond, I talked about having clear goals, clear goals.\\nNot some high level pie in the sky goal.\\nYou want to have very specific goals\\nand I talked about how to rank and track those goals.\\nTracking, I talked about using the concept of maturity.\\nSo for example, you don't say,\\n\\\"I need this vulnerability scanner,\\\"\\nand then they buy it for you and it's good,\\nbecause security is a journey, not a destination.\\n\\nWhat you would say is, \\\"All right, we have nothing.\\nWe are zero maturity.\\nBy buying this, we are now maturity one,\\\"\\nbut there's still many other tasks at hand.\\nWe still need to install it, use it,\\nand get very effective at using it\\nand eventually optimize and integrate.\\nSo I talked about how you can track these things\\nand use it as a way to show success,\\nwhich brings us to point three,\\nbeing able to understand what success is\\nand have this trackable success roadmap.\\nSo as you work through your program,\\nyou can continue to show success.\\n\\nSo if there's change,\\nadditional budget and resources needed,\\nyou're not just asking for stuff,\\nbut you can show based on previous success,\\n\\\"We need these resources to have more success.\\\"\\nLastly, it's important to understand the required resources.\\nSo rather than saying, \\\"We're going to do this,\\\"\\nyou need to understand what you currently have.\\nYou need to understand\\nwhat kind of people and skill sets you have\\nand understand the gaps and understand the timelines.\\nI talked about time to value.\\nTime the value is key,\\nbecause that may then have a conversation about,\\n\\\"Well, do we hire somebody,\\\" versus outsourcing,\\nwhich are two different approaches\\nto accomplish the same goal.\\n\\nThese are the key factors\\nthat I highly recommend for you to think about.\\nWhen I hear about organizations\\ntrying to go towards a Zero Trust model and fail,\\nit's very likely they didn't follow\\nall four of these recommendations.\\nSo what do you do, what is the next step?\\nYou've taken the course, you've covered the principles,\\nyou understand the concepts.\\nHow do you make this real for you?\\nIn short, our recommendation is follow the examples I did\\nand apply it to your environment.\\n\\nWhat are your business goals?\\nLet's rank those.\\nWhat are your technology goals?\\nLet's rank those and make sure they align to the business.\\nLet's build a Zero Trust story\\nand let's find your executive sponsor.\\nLet's make sure he or she has the authority\\nto help you accomplish your goals and achieve your budgets.\\nWhat's understanding your limitations and challenges?\\nDo you have data sovereignty?\\nDo you have compliance challenges?\\nIs there're going to be pushback?\\nMake sure that you are planning ahead.\\nSo when it comes to your asks, there's no surprises.\\n\\n'Cause as I said earlier in the course,\\nsurprises are for birthdays, they're not for business.\\nYou're probably going to want to do a heat map\\nand that heat map's going to help you understand\\nwhat you currently have or what's on the truck.\\nYou can use the heat maps I provided or make up your own.\\nBut the idea is you need to understand where you're at\\nand probably use some kind of color-coordinated system,\\nso that non-technical people\\ncan understand the before and after.\\nAlso, you can show areas of consolidation\\nby doing a heat map, maybe find some additional budget\\nby reducing the amount of vendors\\nas well as maybe understanding\\nwhat the tabletop exercise gaps in people\\nwhere then you either need to outsource or train\\nor maybe reassign tasks.\\n\\nLastly, start to create your plan\\nand look at the time to value for each step.\\nThink about if it makes more sense,\\nthe outsource and I covered the values\\nof going either approach in-house or outsourcing,\\nas well as I talked about specific things to think about\\nwhen it comes to the capabilities\\nthat are available and different approaches\\nto basically accomplish a goal.\\nFor example, you may see that your data center\\nis traditional and on-prem,\\nand one option to move towards a centralized class model\\nis to completely upgrade the data center,\\nwhich is probably unrealistic.\\n\\nIt's going to cost you a lot of money and change your business.\\nOr option two may be using some form of connector\\nand basically integrating the on-prem with cloud\\nand making it seem\\nlike everything that is on-prem is in the cloud.\\nSo from the user experience, they won't know the difference.\\nBe a lot less expensive, shorter time to value,\\nand you'll get the same kind of outcome.\\nThe whole hope and dream of me creating this course\\nis not to just teach concepts around Zero Trust\\nor make you sound smart, it's to give you actionable items.\\nHopefully what I've accomplished is helped you create a list\\nand helped you actually not only be able to build your plan,\\nbut be able to go back to guidelines, use those guidelines,\\nand have referenceable material to help sell your story.\\n\\nIf I'm able to help you increase your security\\nand help you on your Zero Trust journey,\\nI feel like I've accomplished my job.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3963526\",\"duration\":974,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Zero Trust

One of the most common questions asked of me is,\\n\\\"What is the next step I should take in my career\\nregarding cybersecurity?\\\"\\nWhether it's specifically around zero trust,\\nor generally saying, \\\"How do I get a job in cybersecurity?\\\"\\nI've been asked this question\\nwhen I speak at major conferences, when I meet with people,\\nwhen I teach courses.\\nIt's a common one,\\nso I figured let's address it in this course.\\nAnd the first key thing about cybersecurity work\\nis that it's not going away.\\n\\nNow, recently, there's been some layoffs\\nin major organizations,\\nbut that doesn't mean that like the actual need\\nfor the work has gone away.\\nFor example, when there was an increase in demand\\nof all the tech firms hiring a bunch of people,\\nwhich happened basically following the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nNow, some of those corporations\\nhave too many people and letting 'em go,\\nbut if you think about other organizations,\\nbanking and other professions, they still have that need.\\n\\nSo, again, cybersecurity professionals,\\neven though sometimes people think\\nthere's a surplus in certain industries, sure,\\nbut there's always going to be a need.\\nWhat I'm showing here is an example of just the growth.\\nAnd with the technology constantly changing,\\nnew things like AI coming out,\\nthere's always going to be needed to find professionals\\nto fill these roles.\\nNow, when it comes to actually security jobs,\\nyou may be wondering, well, what's the best one for you?\\nEarlier in this course,\\nWell, ransomware works by infecting a system,\\nencrypting the data, and then holding that data ransom.\\n\\nTo defend against ransomware,\\nthere are many very different types of roles.\\nYou have roles within the security operations center,\\nand these are the kind of people\\nlooking for malicious activity, monitoring security tools,\\nand, more or less, being the overwatching persona\\nof the organization.\\nThere are very, very technical malware analytic roles.\\nThese are roles around like verse engineering malware,\\nputting 'em in sandboxes, and trying to basically dissect\\nand understand how the malware is created.\\n\\nThere's incident response roles.\\nJobs around like helping organizations\\nthat have been impacted by ransomware\\nand getting a back to a working state.\\nThere's roles like what I do, which is consulting roles,\\nwhere you go to organizations\\nand help them improve their security\\nand reduce the risk of breach.\\nFor example, with the knowledge you have around zero trust,\\nyou could be a consultant\\nand help others improve their security.\\nThere are roles around compliance, compliancy officers,\\npeople who specialize in specific compliance,\\nsuch as a PCI DSS or HIPAA,\\nor some form of compliance that's need to be met\\nand you need to prove it with certain type of reporting.\\n\\nThere are delivery people, delivery engineers.\\nSo, once you acquire some kind of technology,\\nthese are the people that go out, install it,\\ndo the training, and everything in between.\\nThere are also very specialized cybersecurity roles,\\nlike forensics, people who basically understand the law\\nand legal impact.\\nAnd if an event was to occur\\nand there wants to be a court case\\nor there wants to be a situation that's brought to court,\\nyou need to have the right evidence,\\nand these are the forensic experts that can do that.\\n\\nThere's also data privacy, leaders,\\nand other roles that are not even listed,\\nsuch as like salespeople or sales architects\\nthat helps sell the tools\\nthat organizations use to reduce the risk of ransomware.\\nSo, again, there's lots of different types of roles\\nthat are available\\nand all these roles could be different\\nbased on where you work.\\nSo, the question is not if there's a job,\\nit's more about what's the right job for you.\\nNow, I teach a course on this concept,\\nbut in short, I like to break down cybersecurity roles\\ninto these five buckets.\\n\\nEssentially, there are roles that are around presales.\\nSo, roles that make money for the organization.\\nThese kind of roles can be extremely technical\\nor not technical at all.\\nHere's a disclaimer for you.\\nIf you're all about making money,\\nyou're going to want to be in sales.\\nBy far, salespeople make the most money,\\nbut you're also going to be the least technical\\nand it has a lot of pressure.\\nAnd depending on the role you're in,\\nyou can either make or completely break\\nthe type of money you make,\\nmeaning the swing could be ridiculous\\nfrom making very little money to making millions.\\n\\nThere's also, as I mentioned,\\ntechnical and very technical as you go down\\nthe engineering and architect realm.\\nAnd eventually get into the leadership,\\nthat's the decision around either putting on the keyboard\\nor staying technical.\\nNow, in my experience, when it comes to presales,\\nsales roles, and leadership roles,\\nyou don't have to become a leader or be non-technical.\\nLike you can, there's typically paths within an organization\\nwhere you can be super senior and principal architects\\nand engineers and make the same money\\nas directors and higher.\\n\\nBut the idea is you need to question yourself,\\nwhat are your skill sets?\\nTypically with presales roles,\\nthere needs to be a blend of soft skills\\nand technical skills,\\nmeaning you need to be in front of people to help sell.\\nOr if you're in marketing, be creative,\\nbut there needs to be certain skill sets\\nbeyond being very technical.\\nIf you're an introvert, you're not good in front of people,\\nsome of these roles may not make sense for you.\\nThe second category is post-sales,\\nmeaning you're delivering something,\\nwhether you're a consultant,\\nyou're doing short-term delivery services,\\nyou're always on site fixing things,\\nyou're the support staff.\\n\\nEssentially, the big difference is you're a cost.\\nSo, presales, you're making money,\\npost-sales are typically a cost.\\nThese roles tend to have time cards\\nand have specific deliverables.\\nAnd it's based on performance and other measures,\\nversus like a presales role\\nthat's basing success on sales numbers.\\nThese kind of roles could be very technical\\nor they can be more like a project manager.\\nSo, not as technical role.\\nAnd these roles, in my experience,\\nyou could be a introvert or you could be an extrovert,\\ndoesn't really matter,\\nbut there are options depending on what you want to do.\\n\\nThe third set of roles\\nwill be within your security operations center,\\nand a SOC can be in any type of organization,\\nfrom large to small,\\nlike one person could be the SOC,\\nor you can have a whole team.\\nBut a SOC has various types of roles,\\nfrom analyst type roles to desktop support\\nto very specialized roles,\\nlike a pen tester or a forensics expert.\\nIn my experience, roles tend to be tier base.\\nSo, you're either like a tier 1, tier 2, tier 3.\\nAnd as you gain experience, you kind of go up the realm.\\n\\nSo, sometimes people will ask me,\\n\\\"Well, I've been a sales engineer for 10 years,\\nI want to get into SOC work,\\\"\\nand they want to jump to like a tier 2 or tier 3.\\nIf you lack that experience, it may be difficult to do that.\\nYou may have to start with a tier 1\\nand understand kind of how a SOC works\\nbefore you can move to a higher base role.\\nThese kind of roles can be very technical\\nor you can be more of a leader and not technical.\\nAnd these kind of roles\\ncould be more of a post-sales type feeling.\\nMeaning that you're a cost, meaning you have a time card,\\nand you have specific responsibilities to show success.\\n\\nThe next field is research, which is an interesting field.\\nI would say, in my opinion,\\nresearch are probably one of the more relaxed fields,\\nwhere you're not necessarily part of sales or anything.\\nThere is basically no like enemies.\\nWhen it comes to other researchers,\\nit's more good versus evil.\\nFor example, if you work at one company,\\nlike Cisco or something,\\nyou'll be happy to talk to the researchers\\nat a competitive company\\nbecause in the end, you're a researcher.\\nAgain, you're both trying to understand the threat actors\\nbecause it's good versus evil.\\n\\nThe research communities where you find the most people\\nthat go out and speak at conferences,\\nthey're the ones that tend to do a lot of the online events.\\nThey're very public-facing, they have their blogs.\\nIt's a different field.\\nIf you want to experience what it's like to be\\nin this kind of persona of researcher,\\nI highly recommend for you to go\\nto some of the security conferences like Devcon or ShmooCon,\\nwhere you have people speaking about topics\\nand you can kind of get a feel\\nof what the environment's like.\\nWhen I've gone to research departments for very big firms,\\nit tends to be very relaxed.\\n\\nPeople are wearing T-shirts, rock and roll T-shirts.\\nPeople, even at five o'clock, we bring beer to the office.\\nAgain, it's a much more relaxed environment\\nbecause it's more about research.\\nThis area is definitely about what you know,\\ncould be extremely technical,\\ngood for inverts or extroverts,\\nbut also could be non-technical.\\nYou could be, you know, manager, leader, et cetera,\\nwithin this realm, but it's a different field at work.\\nAnd then finally, you got roles around products,\\nso you're building stuff.\\nSo, you're part of what we call the BU, or business units.\\n\\nAnd these roles could be very tactical.\\nSo, you have these skill sets.\\nFor example, right now, there's an arms raise for AI.\\nSo, if you have engineering experience\\nbuilding AI mechanisms and products,\\nyou're in hot to be in right now.\\nAnd you're probably going to be hired by a big company\\nvia the business unit, or the people that build products.\\nNow, there may be some non-technical roles,\\nroles that interact with customers,\\ntry to understand the customer experience,\\nor training, et cetera,\\nbut this is more around the backend,\\nor the product developers.\\n\\nThere may be other roles that are involved in security,\\nlike consulting roles, compliancy, et cetera.\\nBut in general, I would say that this is a easy way\\nto really understand the general categories of work.\\nMy challenge to you would be is think about these\\nin general-type roles\\nand figure out what you're good at and what you want to do.\\nDo you like training? Do you like educating yourself?\\nDo you like maintaining,\\nkeeping up with the current trends?\\nOr, do you not like testing?\\nThat would have a cha an impact on what you should do.\\n\\nAre you a good writer?\\nFor example, people will ask about\\nwanting to be a pen tester\\nand they're excited about the idea\\nof hacking into the systems,\\nnot realizing that pen testers\\ntypically have to write very technical reports,\\nand the report will make or break the success\\nof the pen tester.\\nIf you tell somebody\\nthat their staff is horrible and incompetence,\\nyou're probably not going to get hired again\\n'cause you're going to probably get people fired\\nand you're just delivering the wrong message,\\nversus your staff's effective,\\nbut these are the challenges\\nand these are the areas to improve.\\n\\nAre you more customer-facing\\nor are you afraid to talk to customers and sell?\\nOr, can you do public speaking?\\nOr, are you more of like an introvert?\\nAre you more of a team player\\nor do you more of work independently?\\nNow, some people may say\\nyou always need to have team player skills,\\nbut no, there are some people that are very good,\\nworking independently, researchers,\\nand they have no problem getting hired\\nand doing what they do.\\nBut think about who you are,\\nthink about where you're at in your life.\\n\\nAnd then from there,\\nyou can decide what is the ideal path for you.\\nAnd then from there, build your plan to get there.\\nNow, when it comes to the available organizations out there,\\nthere are many that are looking for people like you.\\nI tend to find that there's a couple categories.\\nYou got your consultants and resellers,\\nyour Booz Allens, et cetera, that are more vendor-neutral\\nand more specialized and security and other services.\\nYou got specific vendors\\nthat sell their technology and their research and services.\\n\\nAnd then you got organizations\\nthat need security experts to keep 'em secure,\\nlike people that work within the security operation center.\\nYou have organizations that are very big\\nand organizations that are very small,\\nand you just need to weigh\\nwhere do you think you would want to work.\\nSo, ideally, when people say,\\n\\\"Well, what's the best job for me?\\nWhere should I go?\\\"\\nThink about what's important to you,\\nwhat skill sets you have.\\nAlso, weigh in things like what's important.\\nIs it money or is it where you live?\\nFor example, I had some friends\\nthat wanted to live in Sweden,\\nso they took a a different role\\nthat wasn't as good as their current role\\nbut allowed them to move to Sweden.\\n\\nSo, is it where you want to live?\\nHow much travel's involved?\\nYou know, if you're young it may not matter,\\nbut if you have a family, like I do,\\nit starts to become more challenging to travel all the time.\\nAlso, what kind of benefits exist.\\nYou want to think about like if you have a family\\nversus like a small startup\\nthat doesn't provide as much benefits,\\nis that going to work for you or not?\\nSo, these are just different things to kind of think about,\\nas well as the type of work.\\nMaybe you get paid very well,\\nor a new role will pay you $5,000 more a year, U.S.,\\nbut like you're going to hate the work.\\n\\nSo, why like for $5,000 more\\ngo from something you really love to do\\nto something you hate.\\nSo, I challenge you is think about those things,\\nand then from there, think about the right role from you,\\nthen build the training plan,\\nwhich comes to the final question I'm always asked,\\nwhich is, do I go to school and get a master's degree?\\nDo I go get a certification? Do I just use YouTube?\\nIt's up to whatever kind of role\\nyou're trying to accomplish.\\nI would say in general though,\\nthe more you specialize, the more money you'll make.\\n\\nSo, even if you're like you're doing firewalls,\\nif you're a firewall generalist\\nand you have some general skill sets, you'll do okay.\\nBut if you specialize,\\nand it's like when it comes to like Palo Alto firewalls,\\nfor example, you have very specific skill sets,\\nyou've dealt with them,\\nyou're likely to make more money\\nbecause you are basically a specialist.\\nYou have very special unique skills.\\nSo, you can sell those skills\\nand ideally get a more principal or leader-type role.\\nSo, that's my answer to you when it comes to that question.\\n\\nYou know, what's your next step in your career?\\nThere are certain certifications\\nthat are matched to skill sets.\\nSo, if the pen testing thing is what you want to do,\\nthere is, for example, the certified ethical hacker\\nas an entry level-type certification.\\nBut in my experience with all these type of roles,\\njust having a certification is not going to get you the job.\\nNow, there may be certain situations\\nthe certification gets you the interview.\\nFor example, you have to have a master's degree\\nto apply to a job.\\nAnd long as you have a master's degree in basket weaving,\\nthen they can check that box.\\n\\n'Cause a lot of times when you're being evaluated for roles,\\nit's not done by humans, it's done by automation.\\nSo, you have to meet certain check boxes.\\nSo, sure, there may be some of those check boxes.\\nDo you have your CISSP?\\nIf you don't have that,\\nthen you just don't have that checkbox.\\nWhen it comes to actually landing the job\\nthat you want to do, it's all about what you know.\\nI've personally been in situations\\nwhere my boss and boss's boss dropped out of high school,\\nbut they knew their stuff.\\nAnd in the end, this comes down to,\\nwell, what's your next training?\\nYou can go to YouTube.\\n\\nYou can probably learn everything you need\\nfor the role that you want on YouTube\\nas long as you really know your stuff.\\nSo, if you can get through the check boxes\\nof the first round and interview\\nand show you know your stuff,\\nyou're likely to land in the job.\\nSo, knowing the stuff is really what it comes down to.\\nIs YouTube the best route,\\nis building a lab the best route,\\nis going to a bootcamp,\\nis taking a certification program, or going to university,\\nthat answer is based on how you learn.\\nAnd that's really my recommendation for you\\nand the answer to the question I'm asked so often\\nwhen I'm doing conferences and book signings\\nand other stuff and somebody,\\nasks, \\\"Joey, what should I do?\\nWhere should I take my career from here?\\\"\\nYou got to ask yourself these questions.\\n\\nWhat kind of role is best for you?\\nWhat kind of skill sets are best for you?\\nWhere do you want to be? What matters to you most?\\nIs it the money? Is it the location?\\nIs it the travel?\\nAnd then lastly, once you find that plan,\\nhow do you show you know the skill sets for that job?\\nAnd that can be basically any sort of form of training\\nto allow you to be able to show\\nthat you know what you're talking about.\\nAnd if you can do that\\nand get through that first round of interview,\\nyou're likely to land your future career role\\nthat you want to have.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3966178\",\"duration\":163,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Next steps\",\"fileName\":\"5977010_en_US_09_04_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":false,\"rawDurationSeconds\":163,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":9453322,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\"- Another question outside of what kind of work\\nyou want to do is where you would want to work.\\nAnd this is an important one\\nbecause based on what you're trying to accomplish,\\nmay determine the type of company you want to work for.\\nIn general, I would say there's two types\\nof companies in the world of cybersecurity.\\nThere's the vendor neutral and there's the vendors.\\nSo basically consultant companies that provide products\\nand services, but they're more neutral.\\nSo you go to like a Booz Allen or Accenture,\\nthey're going to sell you different vendor firewalls\\nand other technologies versus working for like a Cisco\\nor Palo Alto that sells from their catalog.\\n\\nAlso, there's two types of versions of these companies.\\nYou have the big company and you have the smaller boutique.\\nSo you may have some big consulting firm\\nor a smaller specialized pen test firm\\nor specialized firm\\nas well as a larger vendor or a startup.\\nAnd if you think about what's important to you,\\nthat would determine where to look.\\nIf money is a big deal, it could depend which way to go.\\nLike a small startup may have a lot of potential\\nin regards to your given stock,\\nbut you don't actually own the stock\\nunless they get acquired.\\n\\nSo there's also potentially a lot of risk versus a company\\nthat's publicly traded where if they give you stock,\\nyou have something you actually own and can sell.\\nOther things to think about would be\\nlike where you want to live.\\nA smaller company that lives in one part of the country\\nwould not likely give you the option to live abroad\\nor a bigger company, maybe your idea is to live\\nin some other country.\\nSo you get a job within your country, prove your value,\\nand then start having conversations with the group\\nthat manages another country so you can make a transfer.\\n\\nOther things to think about is the type of work.\\nSo if you want to specialize\\nand you want to go to like a consulting firm,\\nmaybe that won't be available with some kind of vendor\\n'cause then in the end,\\nLastly, think about benefits.\\nA larger company or like a government company,\\nthese kind of organizations may offer a lot more benefits\\nthan a smaller startup.\\nSo when the question comes to me, you know,\\nwhat's my next job?\\nWhat should I do?\\nIt's not only about the type of job,\\nit may also be which place is ideal for you as well.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Lesson 9: Next Steps\",\"size\":114736229,\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentChapter:3962526\"},{\"duration\":138,\"entries\":[{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3962521\",\"duration\":138,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"The Zero Trust framework: Summary\",\"fileName\":\"5977010_en_US_10_01_VT\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"solutionVideo\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"includesPickups\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":false,\"rawDurationSeconds\":138,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":6307398,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\"- You did it.\\nYou completed the course.

[Instructor] Let's take a look\\nat some of the key components of a mobile network.\\nThere is a user equipment, which is a mobile phone.\\nThen we have radio access network,\\nwhich are the towers sitting on top of the building.\\nWe also have a core network component,\\nwhich is the equipment on the data center.\\nThen we also see business support systems,\\nwhich are known as BSS.\\nThey are crucial in a mobile network.\\nThey provide support such as billing,\\nas well as revenue assurance part.\\n\\nWe also have network management systems,\\nwhich are the telemetry part.\\nAnd they all are connected through infra\\nand our transport network.\\nLet's take a look at a reference architecture.\\nSo in this architecture, we can see a mobile station,\\nwhich is connected to a radio access network.\\nThe radio access network\\nand the core network are connected with a transport layer.\\nAs well as the core network is connected to the internet.\\nThe connectivity established between the radio core\\nand the internet by using port network.\\n\\nWe also have OSS layer,\\nwhich is the network management part,\\nwhich is responsible for the telemetry.\\nWhereas the BSS part is responsible\\nfor providing the users checking CDRs, doing billing,\\nrevenue assurance, all these functionalities.\\nSo this is all about mobile networks.\\nNow, if you look at the call flow,\\nthe call flow comprises of different functionalities,\\nstarting from authentication management,\\nwhere the SIM registers into the mobile network.\\n\\nThen after the registration happens,\\nthere is a session management layer which comes in,\\nin which the mobile network uses the IP address\\nto go to the internet.\\nSo if you are starting your phone,\\nyou're going through the authentication procedure.\\nWhereas if you're using internet,\\nthen your session management has already been established.\\nSo as you are browsing YouTube,\\nyou should know that in which session you are in\\nto give you a good understanding about all these concepts.\\nNow, if you look at the mobile network evolution,\\nstarting from mobile station,\\nwhich are connected to the BTS.\\n\\nYes, radio towers back then in the 2G world were called BTS,\\nwhich were connected to the MSC,\\nwhich are the core networks.\\nSimilarly, if you look at the 3G network,\\nthe mobile station was connected to the node B part,\\nwhich is again, the radio towers.\\nAnd similarly, the node B is connected to the core network.\\nSimilarly, in 4G,\\nthe radio networks terminology have changed\\nas well as in 5G, but the

[Instructor] Now, it's the time to decode mobile networks.\\nDo you know that the first ever text message\\nwas sent in 1992, and it simply read Merry Christmas,\\nand, now, we send over 23 billion text globally every day,\\nand this is not only just a text.\\nWe use the voice calls.\\nWe stream data.\\nWe do applications download.\\nWe do a lot of things.\\nBasically, a lot of data is being processed\\nby the mobile network, but what are those components\\nwho is processing these information?\\nLet us take a look at those.\\n\\nWe know radio access networks, which are the radio towers,\\nthen we know the core networks,\\nwhich are the component setting in the data center,\\ntransport and cloud infrastructure\\nas well as the business support systems.\\nNow, let's take a look\\nat the radio access network architecture\\nand some of the important components\\nwhich makes up this radio access network.\\nWe see radio towers here.\\nRadio towers are just the antennas,\\nwhich you can see on top of the building,\\nthen we also have the radio network controller,\\nwhich is used to process the information coming out\\nfrom the radio tower, and RNCs were used\\nin the 2G, 3G world, then we also see\\nradio units, such as the remote radio units,\\nwhich sits in the radio towers.\\n\\nWe also see the baseband units,\\nwhich is used to process the information\\nwhich comes out from the radio units.\\nWe also see small cells, radio resource management\\nas well as edge computing nodes.\\nIf you look at the architecture from 2G, 3G\\nto 4G and 5G, you see some changes.\\nOne of the changes are that the radio unit for controller\\nhas further desegregated into the baseband units\\nas well as the radio units.\\nSo in the 4G world, the radio units in the BTS tower\\nis no longer just one component.\\n\\nIt has distributed into multiple sub-components,\\nsuch as radio units as well as baseband units.\\nCome 5G, it has further distributed.\\nNow, we see small cells,\\nand that baseband units has been further distributed\\ninto control units, distributed units\\nas well as some edge computing nodes coming in,\\nand all of these are connected to the core network,\\nwhich is residing in the data center\\nthrough the transport network.\\nNow, let's take a look at the evolution of RAN,\\nfrom traditional RAN to cloud and to the Open RAN.\\n\\nIt all started with a Legacy non-virtualized site,\\nwhich is connected from the radio units\\nfrom the BBU towards the core network.\\nFrom the Legacy, we moved to the centralized RAN,\\nwhich means that the BU is coming at the center,\\nwhich are connected to different radio towers,\\nand the BBU is then connected to the packet core,\\nand that BBU is serving as a centralized position\\nfor all the radio network communication.\\nC-RAN then got evolved into the virtualized RAN\\nwhere we have made BBU more virtualized.\\n\\nSo the BBU unit now has transformed to the cloud networks.\\nThe fronthaul communication has still the same.\\nWe use CPU standards to connect to the virtualized BBU,\\nwhich is then connected to the packet core functions,\\nthen comes Open RAN.\\nWith Open RAN, the whole centralized architecture\\ngot more changed.\\nWe see the BBU units are distributed into the control units\\nas well as the distributed units.\\nThe main goal of this is to improve the latency\\nas well as enhance the user experience\\nand better resource management.\\n\\nSo we have to reduce some additional components into it,\\nsuch as radio intelligent controller called RIC\\nas well as some SMU units are also introduced,\\nwhich is the management part of the Open RAN network,\\nand those components are connected to the backhaul network,\\nwhich is the core network.\\nIn this concept, what you have noticed is\\nas we are distributing the network,\\nmaking it more virtualized, making it on the cloud,\\nthe user equipment is now getting more closer\\nto the radio towers.\\n\\nNow, let's take a look at the evolution of the core network.\\nSo we have seen the evolution from the 3G core network\\ntowards the 4G core network as well as the 5G core.\\nThe main thing is the core network,\\nin the traditional days, it is the circuit core network,\\nwhich is mainly responsible for the voice traffic\\nand packet core, which is responsible for the IP traffic,\\nbut in the 4G world, that all has converged a bit.\\nWe have seen the introduction of IMS traffic,\\nwhich is the voiceover, the packet core traffic,\\nthen we have also seen that the packet core has evolved,\\nintroducing HSS from HLR, and then we have also seen\\nsome functions like serving gateway, PDN gateway,\\npolicy and charging function,\\nwhich were not there in the 3G world,\\nand if you look at the 5G core network,\\nthings got really interesting.\\n\\nThe packet core has all evolved into a IP based network,\\nwhich is supported by SATP communication.\\nSo the 5G core network,\\nwe have seen access mobility function,\\nwhich is used to do authentication for the users.\\nWe have also seen session management function got evolved,\\nthe user plane, policy control function,\\nand the list goes on.\\nBasically, it has all changed\\ninto a service-based architecture.\\nIf you look at the core network evolution,\\nyou see that it has also evolved a lot.\\n\\nThe whole component setting in the core networks\\nhas become more distributed, more virtualized,\\nmore information that has been captured out of that,\\nand it has more changed into a cloud\\nand SATP based communication.\\nNow, if you look at the cloud infra and transport network,\\ncloud infra is mainly comprised of the computing resources,\\nstorage networking database, and orchestration part,\\nwhereas a transport network is access network,\\nthe aggregation network, core, and the edge network.\\n\\nIf you look at this architecture,\\nthe radio is connected to the core network\\nwith access routers.\\nYes, the access routers are part of the transport network,\\nwhereas there are some core routers as well,\\nwhich are connected to the aggregated router\\nbefore it goes to the internet,\\nand then there are some infrastructure resources\\nwhich are setting on the bottom,\\nwhich are responsible to provide\\ncomputing and storage part to the network.\\nLastly, if you look at the BS systems,\\nBS systems are all about supporting the core\\nand the radio networks,\\nsuch as billing and charging functionality.\\n\\nWe see provisioning capabilities, mediations,\\nCRM, and business analytics.\\nAll these are the core functionalities\\nof business support systems in the telecom architecture.\\nI'll see you in the next

standards set by 3GPP and adopted by the ITU.\\n\\nNow let's take a look at the key differences between\\n3GPP's security and the O-RAN security.\\nIn 3GPP it is actually responsible\\nfor the complete cellular network security\\nbut the architecture is monolithic,\\nmeaning it is responsible for the traditional RAN\\nor the cloud RAN plus the core components.\\nIt focuses on signaling security,\\nuser privacy, and encryption.\\nThe key standard is TS 33.501.\\nWhereas if you look at the O-RAN Alliance, O-RAN is all\\nfor open interfaces and modularity.\\n\\nThe architecture is a desegregated\\nand virtualized RAN,\\nwhereas a focus area is interface\\nand ai machine learning security,\\nas well as to control the supply chain risk.\\nThe key standard is working Group 11 SEC rack,\\nwhere you'll see the requirements.\\nNow let's take a look at the 3GPP security guidelines.\\nThe requirements can be from new authentication framework\\nfor 3GPP\\nor for non 3GPP access such as EPAK or AKA prime.\\n\\nIt also has user plan integrity, production features,\\nuser privacy production features such as Suki,\\nas well as subscriber level security policy,\\nwhich can be implemented in UDM.\\nSo every UI can have a different policy.\\nIt also has in reduced IPSec\\nand OAuth 2.0 for service-based architecture\\nto secure the communication between different components.\\nIt also has introduced a SEC function,\\nwhich is a proxy function used for topology hiding\\nand some other features between the roaming partners.\\n\\nNow, if you look at the O-RAN security requirements,\\nit can be application lifecycle management\\nto robust protocol implementation all the way towards\\nsupply chain security hardening.\\nThe monetary requirements are application signing by vendor,\\nsignature validation by SMO\\nin case of application lifecycle management.\\nWhereas for robust protocol implementation,\\nit handles unexpected inputs without functional compromise.\\nTo make sure that the OS is robust\\nit checks for known vulnerabilities in the OS,\\nand applications shall be documented by their providers.\\n\\nThis is the mandatory requirement,\\nand in case of password based authentication,\\nthe requirement is to mitigate risk\\nfrom password authentication attacks\\nwhere password authentication is implemented\\nfor the supply chain risk hardening the vendor needs to sign\\nand NTA compliant ASBO with every O-RAN software delivery.\\nSo this has to be ensured that there should be an ASBO\\nwhich should be an NTA

openness,\\nand if multiple vendors wants to collaborate\\nand support and bring in their software,\\nthere can come in some vulnerabilities as well.\\nNow, if you look at some IT security challenges,\\nthe list can be massive.\\nFor example, an IT security team wants to deploy\\nan EDR agent on your telco workloads.\\n\\nThis can seriously cause some performance issues\\nas well as it can create downtime\\nin your application in case if an EDR agent\\nis blocking a port.\\nNow, let's take a look at some of the use cases\\nin order to understand this better.\\nIn a scenario one, a telecom provider is deploying\\na 5G network with multiple slices\\ndedicated to various services.\\nFor example, a critical infrastructure is having one slice,\\nIoT devices and mobile broadband users,\\nor on a different slice.\\n\\nNow, an attacker has discovered a weak segmentation\\nbetween the network slices,\\nallowing lateral movement across slices.\\nWhat could be the challenge?\\nIf you are thinking that the vendor is using\\nan outdated the 3GPP security release feature,\\nyou may be right.\\nOkay, now let's take a look at the use case number two.\\nIn this use case, a telecom operator\\nhas used multiple vendors to build its own infrastructure.\\nOne vendor unknowingly integrated compromise\\nhardware components that introduce\\nbackdoors into the radio network.\\n\\nWhat could be the challenge?\\nThe challenge is you have to bring all the vendors up\\nto the speed to what your security requirements are,\\nand maybe one of the vendors may not be ready\\nor do not support that security feature\\nwhat you're requesting.\\nThe other use case can be, there's a endpoint detection\\nand response request coming in from your security team\\nto continuously monitor and secure the edge infrastructure.\\nIt should identify anomalous behavior\\nbefore it could affect the entire city network.\\n\\nOkay, think over it.\\nCan this work with telecom infrastructure?\\nThe answer can be yes and no.\\nYes, if it's fine-tuned,\\nthe requirement is properly laid out, tested,\\nvalidated, and implemented.\\nWhereas in some other cases, it may not work\\nbecause if you're deploying an EDR agent\\nin a telco workload, the CPU and the memory utilization\\ncan be high.\\nNow, if you look at some operational maintenance use cases\\nsuch as your UPF is behaving anomaly.\\n\\nSo can you point out that the issue happened\\nto your UPF is not due\\nto the EDR agent that has been installed?\\nYes, the operators can face significant operational\\nchallenges while working with security features\\ncoming in from the IT security side.\\nNow, let's take a look at some\\nof the remediation challenges as well.\\nWe see with 5G, there's an increase attack surface.\\nWith open-RAN, you have a diversity in supply chain.\\nYou also have seen AI in machine learning\\nmodel being poisoned.\\n\\nThere are edge computing doors coming into the network\\nas we are scaling towards the hyperscalers.\\nThere are also some decentralization coming in.\\nThen there is performance sensitivity issues.\\nSo all of this you have to deal\\nwith while you are architecting your security solutions.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:6021056\",\"duration\":20,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge: Study a

[Instructor] Let's begin by\\nreviewing the zero trust maturity model.\\nIt has five main pillars.\\nIdentity, devices, networks,\\napplication workloads, and the data.\\nAnd no matter what pillars you're using, you have\\nto make sure that you are at some stage\\nof the implementation for all these controls.\\nFor example, a traditional control\\nwould be just an MFA, a multifactor authentication,\\nwhereas an a device\\nand an optimal level is that you're not just using an MFA,\\nbut you're also enforcing authentication\\nand authorization checks.\\n\\nYou are having devices which are completely isolated.\\nYour networks are completely segmented,\\nso this is how you check\\nthat at which maturity model stage you are in terms\\nof your design and in terms of your implementation.\\nThen there are also some functions, for example, visibility\\nand analytics, automation\\nand orchestration, as well as governance.\\nSo the zero trust security controls are also applied\\nto these layers as well.\\nNow, let's take a look at\\nwhat are the main zero trust tenets that you need\\nto be aware of and you need to take care of.\\n\\nNow, first is preventing and detecting lateral movement.\\nThis is just to ensure\\nthat you are containing your attack surface.\\nYou are limiting your risk.\\nSecond is securely isolating network resources,\\nmeaning you are segmenting your network\\ninto different domains.\\nThirdly, secure communication\\nbetween your different components, meaning\\nthat the data is protected in transit, in use, and at rest.\\nYou are applying enough security controls\\nfor all these data transit points.\\n\\nLastly, ensure integrity of cloud infrastructure.\\nSo no matter you're using a hybrid cloud model approach\\nor a public cloud infrastructure approach, you need\\nto ensure that your all resources are completely monitored.\\nNow, to better understand all of this,\\nlet's take a look at some reference architecture.\\nThis is an architecture\\nof a zero trust implementation\\nusing a SAAS based approach.\\nHere, there are different segments of the users.\\nFor example, a branch office, ALT, 5G wifi network device,\\nas well as there are some dev team who was trying\\nto access the company data center.\\n\\nAs you see, as they're accessing the company data center,\\nthe resources are going\\nthrough a middle tier, which is a bridge.\\nThis bridge is ensuring\\nthat the data is completely monitored,\\nand all the requests,\\nwhat they're sending is completely monitored\\nand the policies are enforced.\\nFor example, branch office users are only allowed\\nto access company data center if they're\\nusing multifactor authentication,\\nwhereas the dev team who wants\\nto access the cloud applications\\nare only accessing at some particular time,\\nat some specific time.\\n\\nThey're not accessing at all times.\\nSo this is a sample implementation\\nof a ZPA based architecture.\\nNow, in the second architecture model,\\nif you see the users are segmented into different segments,\\nuser A is in into a different category\\nand they're having policy rules, RBAC 1, for example,\\nrole-based access control, where they're allowed\\nto do certain operations,\\nand even if they're doing such operations,\\nthere is a decision point which is coming along,\\nwhich is if user A is allowed to access resource A,\\nthen he should be only allowed\\nto access resource A at some particular time,\\nand even if he does,\\nhe should not access critical information of that resource.\\n\\nSo this is where the decision comes in\\nand who is triggering these decisions?\\nThere are lightweight agents sitting on your infrastructure,\\nwhich is enforcing such controls\\nto your decision making policies.\\nThis is how the architecture comes up\\nif you are going to the design stage.\\nThen there are different gaps in the CTF\\nfor 5G architecture.\\nthere are some considerations\\nand some challenges which you see\\nas you are implementing these designs,\\nwhich is first is multi-tenant security challenges.\\n\\nSo a traditional 5G architecture,\\nyou see different vendors\\nthat are making up the 5G applications.\\nMaybe some of the ZTE controls are not\\ncompatible with their applications.\\nYou can see some performance and latency issues.\\nIf you're going with a SAAS solution\\nor an access based solution, there can be some performance\\nand latency issue that can come up\\nas you are implementing such controls.\\nMaybe these solutions are not compatible\\nwith your legacy systems, meaning the protocols\\nand the software that are needed\\nto implement such solutions are not compatible\\nwith their protocol stack.\\n\\nLastly, there can\\nbe some cloud native security maturity model, meaning\\nthat if you're enforcing ZTA controls, the cloud stack,\\ndo not support such protocols,\\nso you don't have any choice then to look\\nfor some alternatives.\\nNow, as you have seen different solutions,\\nwhat do you think which are the best in the market?\\nWhich are the optimal solutions\\nfor your zero trust implementation?\\nThe choice is yours,\\nbut the most important takeaways that you have\\nto carefully design your architecture.\\n\\nYou have to assess in which stage\\nof the maturity model you are\\nand what are you heading against,\\nand what are your core objectives.\\nI hope that you have found this video insightful.\\nI'll see you in the next

[Instructor] Now as we go through\\ndifferent zero trust security guidelines\\nfrom the standard organization,\\nlet us take a look\\nat some of the main standard organizations\\nin the telecom world.\\nThe first is 3GPP.\\n3GPP defines zero trust security architecture\\nfrom end-to-end.\\nIt gives you security protocols\\nfor authentication, encryption, and access control.\\nIt also defines what security controls you need to enforce\\non your radio access as well as the core networks.\\nSecond is the ETSI.\\n\\nETSI defines the broader security framework for 5G.\\nSo you have seen in the 5G deployments, you use NFV,\\nwhich is the net for function virtualization layer.\\nYou also use multi-access edge computing\\nas well as automation and orchestration.\\nSo all those supporting pillar security\\nis being given by ETSI,\\nwhereas the core applications for the core and the RAN\\nis being defined by 3GPP.\\nThat's how they both differ from each other.\\nTake a look at why do we need zero trust in 5G?\\nHave you ever thought about it?\\nWe have security standards given by 3GPP and ETSI,\\nbut why do we need zero trust?\\nThe main reasons are the following.\\n\\nWe have seen shift in the network architecture\\nfrom the traditional bare metal\\nall the way towards the cloud NFV part,\\nso the attack surfaces keep on increasing.\\nWe see interoperability and the compliance issues coming in.\\nThere are different vendor applications\\nwhich are making up that 5G network.\\nYou need to hit some compliance requirements.\\nThere are some APT with insider risk.\\nYou know, there are standardization\\nand the vendor neutrality that you need to accomplish\\nin your 5G design.\\nThen there are new technologies keep coming in.\\n\\nWe have seen AI coming in.\\nWe have seen the cloud microservices\\nthat are making up this 5G network.\\nSo this is so getting complex.\\nWe need a a common security framework,\\nand zero trust is the answer for that.\\nNow since we have defined the zero trust ground,\\nlet's take a look\\nThere are two main documents which you need to follow.\\nOne is the 3GPP TS 33.501,\\nwhich defines authentication, encryption,\\naccess control checks from the user equipment,\\nall the way towards the core.\\n\\nThen it also specifies in its 23.501 document,\\nif you have network slicing,\\nhow you can enforce zero trust into it,\\nwhich gives you secure and isolated virtual slices\\nfor different services.\\nNow that you have understood 3GPP,\\nlet's take a look at ETSI security guidelines.\\nThere are three main components to it.\\nOne are the guidelines for the NFV,\\nwhich is the VNF and the CNF part to it.\\nIt has two main documents.\\nOne is the SEC 003,\\nwhich defines the trust between the VNFs and the CNFs.\\n\\nThen you can also see the detailed guidelines\\non the secure lifecycle management of the CNFs\\nin its 040 document.\\nThe other two main pillars\\nare the multi-access edge computing and the zero trust,\\nwhereas it gives you that secure isolation and segmentation\\nof edge applications\\nand in other part, it can also help you in automating\\nand orchestrating security policies dynamically\\nacross VNFs and CNFs.\\n\\nNow, which you want to use, which one not to use,\\nthe choice is yours.\\nIt depends on the use case as well as architecture\\nand security objectives you want to achieve in your design.\\nNow let's take a look\\nat the zero trust security focus areas.\\nSo we have seen the zero trust tenets, which are there.\\nWe have to now see how these tenets are applied\\nto the 3GPP side of the house,\\nas well as how they are applied to the ETSI focus areas.\\n\\nIf you look at the strict identity and verification,\\n3GPP says that you can do that\\nwith a mutual authentication across RAN and core,\\nwhereas the same tenet,\\nif you look at from the ETSI perspective,\\nit says you can achieve this\\nby continuous identity verification\\nfor the VNFs and the CNFs.\\nNow, if you look at the other tenet,\\nleast privilege access with 3GPP in its 23.501 document,\\nit says, for network slicing\\nfor segmented and minimal access,\\nmeaning you can achieve least privilege principle\\nif you can follow these principles\\nwhich are specified for its network slicing use case.\\n\\nThen for ETSI,\\nit's micro segmentation and isolation of VNF and CNFs.\\nSo if you go through different zero trust tenets,\\nyou'll see both of these standard bodies\\nare coming up with their own security requirements\\nto enforce all these zero trust tenets.\\nThe important part is if you know what the tenets are,\\nwhat are your use cases,\\nthen you can take something from the 3GPP document\\nas well as you can take something from the ETSI document,\\ndepending on really on what you need to do\\nand how you want to architect that solution.\\n\\nFor the reference, I'll show you a document which is 33.894.\\nIt specifies six main important controls.\\nIt gives you the detailed analysis\\nof the zero trust security requirements\\nfor different layers of your 5G network,\\nstarting from the core,\\nthen to the network slicing, micro-segmentation,\\nall the way to if you are having an AI/ML\\nin your RAN network,\\nhow would you implement zero trust?\\nI really want you to take a look at this document,\\ngo through its different segments, different sections,\\nand tell me your thoughts\\nabout how do you think you can enforce,\\ntake these requirements\\nand enforce the zero trust security controls\\nin your network.\\n\\nI hope that you have found this video insightful.\\nI'll see you in the next one.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:6012464\",\"duration\":287,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"ORAN Alliance security

[Instructor] So, O-RAN Alliance, before we go\\ninto the requirements, let's take a look\\nat the Zero Trust architecture journey\\nfor O-RAN Alliance.\\nAs we know, O-RAN is open RAN.\\nIt is open, meaning every vendor can come in.\\nIt is disaggregated,\\nmeaning every vendor can bring in their components,\\nand you don't have to be...\\nOne component doesn't have\\nto be coming from the same vendor.\\nIt is having a multi-vendor ecosystem,\\nmeaning the traditional setup of RAN,\\nwhereas it was coming just from Samsung, or from Avenir.\\n\\nNow, there are different small vendors\\nwhich are participating in the ecosystem,\\nand they're working on different layers\\nof the O-RAN architecture.\\nThe zero trust in O-RAN is the key principle.\\nSo they have started this security architecture based\\non the zero trust principles.\\nSo whatever they're doing, their focus area is zero trust.\\nAnd what it means, that it is enhancing the security\\nof the overall 5G network.\\nBecause if you see the modern deployment of 5G,\\nZero trust in O-RAN is a talking point\\nfor the 5G overall security design.\\n\\nIt offers collaboration and standardization.\\nIt has a lot of sub pillars,\\nand sub-organizations who are now becoming a part\\nof the O-RAN alliance,\\nand they are fostering collaborations.\\nThey're also producing future roadmap that, for example,\\nif at this point in time, this is where they are in terms\\nof their zero trust journey,\\nand they also have a roadmap that, for example,\\nin the next quarter, what are their key fundamental areas\\nwhich they want to focus on?\\nSo this is a bit about the journey of the O-RAN alliance.\\n\\nNow if you look at the zero trust security requirements\\nin O-RAN architecture,\\nit is de divided into four main components.\\nOne layer is the strong authentication\\nand identity management,\\nwhich means all the O-RAN interfaces, example, O-CU, O-DU,\\nO-RU, or the near real time RIC require\\nmutual authentication to ensure that each entity is verified\\nbefore they communicate.\\nSo they're using like PKI,\\nthey're using certificate authority management to make sure\\nthat the mutual authentication is taking place.\\n\\nThen the next layer is the micro-segmentation\\nand isolation, meaning each network element in O-RAN\\nis completely isolated in its own segment,\\nwhich prevents lateral movement in case of a data breach.\\nIt also offers realtime monitoring and adaptive security,\\nmeaning the real time RIC, for example,\\nthe RAN intelligent controller provides real time\\ndecision making and threat monitoring\\nacross the RAN architecture.\\nThen the last component is the secure software\\nand supply chain.\\n\\nThis gives the open multi-vendor nature\\nof O-RAN strict software supply chain security,\\nwhich is critical to avoid tampered software\\nor malicious updates.\\nNow that we have understood the security requirements\\nfrom O-RAN, let's see how they're collaborating\\nwith other standards organization.\\nO-RAN security standards are increasingly aligned.\\nAs they're evolving their security standards,\\nthey're keep communicating with three GPP so\\nthat the three GPP security requirements are also aligned\\nwith their O-RAN security requirements as well.\\n\\nAs well as they're keeping in check\\nthe ETSI standards organization as well, which means\\nthat when we're going into the zero trust journey,\\nthe overall standards organization should follow\\na definitive path, which leads to success,\\nas well as, which gives operators liberty\\nto choose from the requirements\\nfrom these different organizations.\\nNow let's take a look at the O-RAN value proposition.\\nIn O-RAN, every working group has a scope\\nof activity defined.\\n\\nFor example, security has a working group (indistinct),\\nthe management part has a different working group,\\nand all of them are working towards the roadmap\\nfor zero trust security.\\nIt ensures access control, meaning\\nthat every component in O-RAN architecture\\nhas a strong access control mechanism.\\nIt also has segmentation to it.\\nIt has visibility and monitoring,\\nas well as vendor interoperability.\\nSo this is what is the value proposition of O-RAN,\\nand this is all heading towards its zero trust journey.\\n\\nNow that you have understood all of this,\\none question for you.\\nDid you know that O-RAN is not only about tech innovation,\\nbut also about democratizing the telecom industry?\\nWhen you think about O-RAN, think about\\nthat O-RAN is ensuring that the zero trust is getting\\nto the telecom industry.\\nThat is the good part of it.\\nI hope that you have enjoyed this video,\\nI will see you in the next one.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:6020104\",\"duration\":280,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Telecom security

[Instructor] Now that we have understood\\nthe zero trust requirements\\nfrom the different standard organizations,\\nlet's take a look at\\nwhat makes a good telecom security architecture.\\nIt has different layers to it.\\nIf you look from the architecture point of view,\\nwe have end user who is accessing the mobile network service\\nfrom its phone or from its wireless device.\\nWhen the user uses the phone, the signal reaches to a RAN,\\nwhich is radio access network,\\nwhich is involved in secure communication\\nbetween user devices and the base station.\\n\\nThen we have edge networks, which is for example,\\nthe user plane close to the user to support low latency.\\nThen as the signals are going from\\nthat radio access network, it goes to the core network\\nwhere the actual signaling\\nand the data flow happens, which also gives access control.\\nWe have also a transport network which ensures\\nconfidentiality and integrity of the data transmission\\nbetween network elements.\\nWe have network function virtualization layer\\nin which you are building up the 5G applications,\\nwhich is comprised of virtualized infrastructure\\nthat host VFS and CNFs,\\nrequiring secure solution and monitoring.\\n\\nSo whenever you are using a mobile phone\\nor you are setting in your like network browsing internet,\\nthese are the all components which are involved\\nin our telecom architecture, security of it,\\nmeaning that you're ensuring security controls\\nacross all of these layers\\nand it follows a layered architecture.\\nSo think of distributing this\\narchitecture into different layers.\\nSome of the layers goes to the application layer,\\nwhich is for example, the user equipment.\\n\\nThe radio access network goes into the application layer,\\nwhereas the security management layer\\nis where you are setting up the devices\\nto monitor those layers,\\nwhich are grasping the data across different components.\\nWe have the domain solutions,\\nwhich is coming from the vendor side,\\nwhich are actually building up the software\\nof the 5G network.\\nWe have equipment security, for example,\\nsecurity for the mobile devices,\\nsecurity for the wifi devices.\\nThese are all going into the equipment security layer.\\nSo then there are standards security requirements\\nwhich are coming in from different standard organizations.\\n\\nSo as you are defining your structure,\\nmaking sure that you are giving some room\\nfor the standards security requirements as well.\\nNow how that all fits in.\\nNow, if you look at different layers,\\nwhen you define a telecom security architecture,\\nyou define different layers\\nof security in your architecture.\\nFor example, if you look at the middle tier,\\nit has the radio access network and the user equipments.\\nThen we have MEC component, we have the transport layer,\\nand then we have the core network,\\nwhich is the 5GC layer.\\n\\nThen we have the internet, which is being used here, right?\\nSo if you look at the different layers,\\nwe want to use security at different layers,\\nmeaning we have a security management layer,\\nwhich is checking that\\nhow the data has been traveling across\\nthese different components.\\nAre there any threats coming in from the internet?\\nAre there any threats coming in from the inside network?\\nThen we have sub solutions,\\nwhich are protecting different layers.\\nWe have a RAN security layer,\\nwhich is focusing on the RAN security side.\\n\\nFor example, fake base station detection,\\nsecured transmission for the RAN components.\\nThen we have the 5GC security,\\nwhich is checking the security of the 5G core network.\\nHow do you do this?\\nYou define multi-layer isolation and hardening techniques.\\nThen for the MEC component, which is closer to the user,\\nwe define MEC platform hardening, security ops,\\nand ensure end-to-end encryption of the local network.\\nAnd if you have the slicing component in your network clear,\\nyou define slice, isolation, encryption,\\nand protection technique.\\n\\nWhat it entails is this gives you\\na well-defined security architecture.\\nFor example, if you are having equipment security layer\\nas well, you also define the equipment security\\nrelated requirements for your equipment layer,\\nwhereas the standard requirements are also coming in.\\nSo think about a big house\\nwhere you are having your telecom network hosted\\nand in that big house you're having\\nsecurity into different rooms.\\nFor example, one room is your radio,\\none room is your core network.\\n\\nThe other room is your handling other parts of your network\\nand you are enforcing security into each\\nof the different rooms that your applications are

[Instructor] Now let's take a look\\nat the area of concerns in telecom network.\\nAnd before we do that, it is important to understand\\nhow the attack vectors have evolved\\nstarting from 4G all the way towards the 5G network.\\nIn the 4G architecture, we have seen subscriber identity\\nsent in the clear text format.\\nWe have seen no user plane integrity protection.\\nThe bidding down attacks are common,\\nand the home network is not a part\\nof the UE authentication decision.\\n\\nNow, how 5G has improved all of this is that with 5G,\\nnow we have seen subscriber identity protection\\nbeing implemented using a SUCI mechanism.\\nWe have seen added user plane integrity protection,\\nand we have also seen\\nthat the mutual authentication methods have evolved.\\nOr there is also a lot of checks implemented,\\nsuch as TLS, OAuth2,\\nwhich is used to protect the new SB architecture.\\nWe've also seen a new security function being added\\ncalled SEPP for the roaming security part.\\n\\nBut even with all of this,\\nwe have seen that 5G security is at risk.\\nThere are some features which are just optional.\\nFor example,\\nuser plane integrity production is not mandatory,\\nit's an optional feature.\\nWhereas operators can also use null algorithm settings,\\nmeaning that the Nz is sent on the clear format\\nwith no SUCI encryption.\\nAs well as there are some early versions of 5G,\\nwhich may not support the features like SUCI\\nor itegrated production,\\nwhich means that the attack surfaces keep on increasing.\\n\\nNow if you look at the threat factors in 5G,\\nit looks very overwhelming\\nconsidering the architecture what we are having,\\nso let me explain you the architecture first.\\nOn the left-hand side, we have the end users,\\nwhich are accessing the network.\\nIn the middle tier, we have three main components,\\nthe RAN part, which is the radio access network,\\nthe EDGE component,\\nwhich is connecting to the radio access network,\\nwhere you are defining the equipments\\nwhich are closer to the user,\\nand then there are the CORE network where the data center is\\nwhere you're actually defining the applications.\\n\\nAnd then, on the right-hand side,\\nyou'll see application on and services,\\nwhich is taking the user to the internet\\nas well as taking the user to the voice services\\nas well and the roaming providers.\\nNow if you look at this architecture,\\nthere are five main components to it.\\nEvery component has an attack vector associated with it.\\nFor example, the end users can come across a DOS attack,\\nwhich is being targeted to their mobile endpoints.\\nWhereas the radio access network can also targeted\\nby attacks on the radio services\\nand man-in-the-middle attack.\\n\\nWhereas the CORE and the EDGE components,\\nthey can also have attacks from site channels.\\nWhereas the insider attacks can also happen,\\nwhich is targeted towards data modification\\nand data leakage.\\nWhereas if you go to the right-hand side,\\ntheir attacks can come from the internet,\\nso this all can be very overwhelming\\nas a user and as an operator to protect against.\\nNow what do we do?\\nLet's take a look at the sample attack on the control plane.\\nThis will give you a better understanding\\nto how an attack can be carried out on the control plane.\\n\\nIf you look at the call flow,\\nthis will explain you how the call is being processed\\nand what are the different steps\\nthat goes into the call processing.\\nIn each of these steps,\\nyou'll see when the data is traveling from the UE\\nfrom the user equipment towards the radio access network,\\nthere can be a DOS attempt on that request.\\nIf there is a core network,\\nwhich is processing some information,\\nthere can be an attack which is targeted towards the API,\\nwhich can take the important information\\nout from the network.\\nSo as you'll see the call flow,\\nyou have to make sure that whatever data\\nhas been flowing across these different components,\\nthese are protected no matter what.\\n\\nYou don't have to set explicit policies.\\nMake sure that you are set implicit trust zone\\nso that when the request is authenticated and authorized,\\nthen only it can travel to the next hop.\\nSimilarly, if you look at the user plane,\\nthis is also telling you the same story.\\nThe user plane communication,\\nwhich is happening on the 5G network,\\nhas different call flows attached to it.\\nEvery component processed information\\nand then gives to its next component.\\n\\nNow, the call flow information\\ncan be subjected to some attacks as well,\\nwhich are targeted towards the user plane.\\nFor example, GTP-U attacks are common.\\nWe have seen DDOS attacks coming in from the internet\\nor from the equipments on the field.\\nSo whatever you are architecting your solutions,\\nyou have to make sure that you quantify those attacks,\\nyou understand the impact of these attacks.\\nFor example, if you have the attacks coming in\\nfrom control plane and the user plane,\\ntry to see the effects of it on the user point of view.\\n\\nFor example, now in case of an attack for the users,\\ntheir services can be compromised.\\nIn these type of attack,\\nthe data exfiltration and the manipulation can happen.\\nBut this is something which is a low priority,\\nbecause this is something\\nwhich cannot happen most of the times.\\nWhereas if the attack that is happening\\non the critical information,\\nwhich is using a security context\\nor which is using a personal identifiable information,\\nand if that information is compromised,\\nit is a high-severity attack.\\n\\nWhereas something which is secure communication\\nwith an MEC orchestrator,\\nwhich means that there are some data\\nwhich has been traveling, and if those data is compromised,\\nwhich is a low-priority data,\\nthen this attack severity can be categorized as low.\\nSo what you have to do, the takeaway out of this is that\\nas you will quantify your attack vectors,\\ntry to see the impact and try to see\\nwhat information has been compromised.\\nIf that information is highly sensitive,\\nthen those attacks are in the critical category,\\nwhereas if the information that is compromised\\nis not so critical for the user or for the operator,\\nand if there is already a compensating control,\\nthen that category should be green,\\nmeaning that it's a low probability\\nand the low category attack vector.\\n\\nNow that we have understood the different impact analysis,\\nwhat do you think,\\nwhat would be the zero trust use cases for 5G?\\nThere are basically six main use cases,\\nstarting from subscriber and user authentication,\\nall the way towards access management and network slicing.\\nWe have seen the control plane and user plane separation,\\n5G core network function security,\\nall the way towards the IoT device security.\\nThese are some of the important zero trust use cases for 5G.\\nSo as you are defining your zero trust architecture,\\nmake sure that all these use cases are part of your design,\\nand then you'll be in a better place\\nto architect your solution.\\n\\nI hope you have liked this video.\\nI'll see you in the next one.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:6012463\",\"duration\":47,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge: High-risk

[Instructor] So why zero trust for mobile networks?\\nFirst off, we have to understand\\nthat 5G is critical national infrastructure.\\nAnd also stated by Seesaw,\\n5G is integral to the modernization\\nof critical infrastructure\\nand essential services.\\nAs we build 5G applications,\\nwe are storing critical information\\nof not only the users,\\nsuch as user details, EME information, cell ID,\\nbut also we are exposing 5G to the enterprises,\\nwhich means it's all about critical infrastructure.\\n\\nSo protecting 5G is crucial for the network security,\\nas well as for the national security of any country.\\nNow, as we know,\\nmobile networks face evolving threats,\\nand with private 5G, cloud-native and AI applications,\\nmobile networks are exposed\\nto the new and sophisticated cyber threats.\\nAnd with 5G, the attack surfaces keep on increasing.\\nAs you are increasing more devices, more applications,\\nit means more data is coming into the network,\\nwe are having now more entry points.\\n\\nAnd the traditional parameter-based security models\\nare just not enough.\\nThey're ineffective.\\nThink about if your firewall is bypassed,\\nyou are exposing your whole network.\\nAnd there are some protocols\\nwhich the firewalls cannot protect against.\\nSo what we need to do,\\nwe need to shift the security\\nfrom the right-hand side of the curve\\ntowards the left-hand side,\\nwhich means implementing security\\nright at the end is not enough.\\n\\nWe have to build security in design.\\nAnd that's how you shift the security\\ntowards the left-hand side,\\nright from the design.\\nNow let us understand how the zero trust\\nstrengthens mobile network security.\\nFirst, it protects critical network functions.\\nFor all your packet core functions\\nin the 5G core network,\\nzero trust policies can ensure\\nthat only authorized services and devices\\ncan communicate within the core.\\nSo your critical information\\nthat are saved in the packet core functions\\ncan be secure.\\n\\nNext, it gives IoT security.\\nSo think about billions of IoT devices\\nwhich are connected to the mobile network.\\nAnd with zero trust,\\nyou can have continuous monitoring\\nand authentication for device security,\\nwhich can address the challenges.\\nIt can also reduce insider threats.\\nZero trust not only mitigates risk\\nfrom both external attackers,\\nbut also it can save you from insider threats as well.\\nFor example, rogue employees\\nor some malicious devices inside the network.\\n\\nIt can give continuous verification.\\nIt can also implement granular access control,\\nwhich can protect against lateral movement\\nwithin the network.\\nDo you know, apart from all the benefits\\nthat you get out of zero Trust

agreement.\\nThen you also have device and user authentication,\\nwhich are mandatory\\nbefore accessing network functions or services.\\n\\nSIM has to authenticate to the mobile network.\\nAnd also there are some NF mutual authentication parameters\\nwhich ensure secure communication.\\nThis is the ZT tenet\\nof continuous authentication and verification.\\nNext is mobile security alignment.\\nSo the mobile network utilizes network slicing to isolate\\nand assign minimal permissions to each slice,\\nwhich can limit potential damage from attacks.\\nThey also have dynamic policies, which can be applied\\nto ensure that only authorized users\\nand devices access specific network segments.\\n\\nFor example, a particular network IoT slice.\\nSo this principle is

management.\\nFor example, the objective for you\\nis to enforce identity-base access controls\\nacross Azure functions, user equipment, and applications.\\nSo what would you do in the zero trust approach?\\nYou would implement IAM with multifactor authentication,\\nwith secure key management,\\nand implement role-based access controls\\nfor each network function and components\\nsuch as the AMF, SMF or RIC if you are an open-RAN.\\n\\nThen you have to also implement secure identifiers,\\nexample SUCI for UE,\\nand also leverage device attestation\\nto ensure only trusted UEs connect to the network.\\nThat is how would you implement the IAM\\nfor your network in the zero trust approach.\\nFor the security control,\\nyou'll apply dynamic access controls\\nand granular policy-based authentication\\nfor network components.\\nNow, if you have to do for the control plane security,\\nwhat do you have to do?\\nYou have to secure the control plane\\nto prevent unauthorized access to signaling\\nand orchestration components.\\n\\nIn a zero trust security approach,\\nyou would use mutual authentication,\\nencrypted communication,\\nand strict access policies\\nbetween your control plane components\\nand you'll use APA security to secure sensitive services.\\nNow, what are the security controls you'll implement?\\nYou'll implement a service-based communication\\nto enforce control plane security, for example, mTLS,\\nwhich is mutual TLS,\\nand then you'll also do transport layer security\\nfor UE-to-core communication\\nand would implement the OAuth2.0,\\nwhich will give you tokenize security\\nfor your control plane.\\n\\nNext is user plane security.\\nTo secure user plane security\\nand protect data communication\\nbetween your end-to-end traffic within the network,\\nyou have to encrypt the data traffic on the user plane.\\nYou'll also apply continuous monitoring for anomalies\\nand do micro-segmentation to limit data exposure.\\nWhat security control you'll implement?\\nYou'll implement IPsec or DTLS for data plane encryption\\nwith real-time traffic monitoring\\nand anomaly detection within the data flows.\\n\\nSo this is how you'll secure your user plane security.\\nNext is micro-segmentation.\\nSo to implement micro-segmentation,\\nmeaning if you have to restrict\\nthe communication between NFs\\nto minimize the lateral movement within the network,\\nthe approach you would take is you would implement\\nmicro-segmentation at the network function level using SDN,\\nwhich is software defined networking,\\nand containerize network policies.\\nFor the security controls,\\nyou'll classify the CNFs based on the functions\\nand sensitivity, SDN-driven network slices,\\nnamespace, and apply ingress and egress policies.\\n\\nLastly, for the access security for the UE\\nand for the radio networks, for example,\\nif you have to secure remote access\\nto edge components in O-RAN\\nto prevent unauthorized tampering,\\nwhat would you do?\\nYou would leverage the zero trust network access\\nto authenticate and authorize access\\nto their distributed units\\nand their control units, particularly at the edge.\\nFor the security controls,\\nyou'll authorized personal and device access\\nDUs/CUs using strict identity checks\\nand posture assessment, meaning anybody who wants\\nto access into the network has to be authorized\\nand authenticated.\\n\\nAnd then you will also do monitor\\nand secure edge interactions to ensure the UE,\\nfor example, any communication of the UE\\nwhich is coming inside the network

authentication,\\nand other use cases such as connection requests as well.\\nThis is all for the mobile authentication and registration,\\nlike think of if you're using just a service,\\nlet's say browsing or doing a voice call.\\nThe first you have to do is you have\\nNext is the solution deployment.\\n\\nSo this happens with the network team designs\\nand deploys the solution for you,\\nwhich means the network monitoring\\nand health check activities.\\nTransaction flow can be real time KPA monitoring\\nand alerting for falls.\\nWho are the users?\\nThe key users can be a NOC operator or an O&M engineer.\\nNext phase of the deployment\\nis a fault detection and incident where you detect, isolate,\\nand resolve network faults.\\nThen we have software updates and patches,\\nwe have capacity planning and resource allocation\\nall the way towards documentation and compliance audits.\\n\\nThe point here is whatever solution phase you are in,\\nwhatever things you're deploying, from the zero-trust angle,\\nyou have to protect everything.\\nThe only way in order to do it properly\\nis if you know the transaction flows\\nand who are your key users and what are they accessing.\\nNext is the business support systems.\\nThis is equally important\\nbecause they are the core functions of your business.\\nThey support the activities of the core\\nand the mobile authentication.\\nFor example, for the deployment phase,\\nwe have service provisioning activities.\\n\\nSomebody have to create a user.\\nWho are those users?\\nThe provisioning engineers,\\nnetwork operators, or the clients.\\nWe have also customer management activities going on.\\nWe have billing and charging activities.\\nWe have the revenue assurance team\\nwho is checking how much revenue is being generated.\\nWe have service provisioning flows,\\nand then we have the customer management\\nwho is constantly onboarding new customers,\\ndoing account management.\\nSo in order to implement zero-trust,\\nyou have to also take care of all these activities.\\nLastly, there is operational\\nand maintenance part of the network.\\n\\nFor example, operations team wants to do planning\\nand resource allocation.\\nWho are the key users?\\nThe key users can be network planners or resource managers.\\nWe also have use cases for hardware installation and setup.\\nWe have teams checking the connectivity,\\ndoing the testing from security configuration\\nall the way towards performance optimization,\\nand then we have also a handover acceptance.\\nIn all these activities,\\nthe important thing is you have to understand\\nthe use case, transaction flows,\\nand how the users are accessing your assets.\\n\\nNow let's put it all together at one place.\\nThe objective is with all the information\\nthat what we have learned, for example, the tax surfaces,\\nthe transaction flows, the domains,\\nthe objective for us is to design and architect\\nour zero-trust reference architecture.\\nHow would you do it? This is how you can do it.\\nYou have to first put down all your components.\\nFor example, if we have on the left hand side,\\nwe have the mobile clients, the IOT devices.\\nOn the middle tier, we have the RAN,\\nwe have the core components, the transport layer,\\nas well as the applications running.\\n\\nWe also have listed the data zone,\\nwhat the users are doing\\nand what the applications are accessing.\\nAnd then we have listed down some of the users here,\\nfor example, the end users are accessing\\nonly the mobile clients.\\nWe have development on operations team\\nwho is accessing the RAN and the transport,\\nthe core components of the network.\\nAnd then we have BSS and security team\\nwho are the supporting function of this architecture.\\nAnd what you'll notice is you'll have a PDP layer,\\nwhich is a policy determination point, which is governing,\\nwhich is defining the policies for you.\\n\\nThese layers can be an access control layer,\\na risk-based control, a threat intelligence unit,\\nand where all the policies\\nare triggering towards one another,\\nand it is telling you what the users can do,\\nwhat the application can do,\\nand how the data can travel\\nacross different components.\\nIn the bottom layer, we have the standards,\\nthe telecom standard security controls,\\nwhich are essentially the policy enforcement point.\\nWe are having the mobile security features coming in\\nas the PEP,\\nas well as we have also the ORAN Alliance Standards,\\nwhich is coming in the PEP.\\n\\nSo from the architecture point of view,\\nthe policy enforcement point can come from three sources.\\nOne is the telecom standards PEP,\\nthe others are the ORAN Alliance, PEP,\\nand lastly is the enterprise policy enforcement points.\\nIf you have to define the right architecture,\\nyou have to know all your policy enforcement points\\nand how to use it, when to use it,\\nit's been defined by your policy determination point,\\nwhich is based on your risk-based approach,\\nand you can also have predefined policy\\nin order to automate all this.\\n\\nNow that you understand\\nthe zero-trust reference architecture,\\nthe key takeaway is to understand your network components.\\nWhat are your network components?\\nSecond is to understand\\nwho is accessing your network components.\\nThirdly, making sure that you have a predefined policy set\\nfor a policy layer,\\nwhich can tell you\\nwhat the user's applications they need to do.\\nAnd how to enforce the policies\\nis by using policy enforcement points.\\n\\nThese are the real security controls\\nwhat you have to implement,\\nand these cannot be just from the enterprise side.\\nIt should have a subset of the three security standards\\nas well as the ORAN security standards.\\nI know it's a lot of information,\\nbut it is good to understand\\nfrom a zero-trust reference architecture point of view\\nhow this all aligns together.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:6015434\",\"duration\":44,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Challenge: Create a security design with policy

[Instructor] Now let's take a look\\nat the zero trust policy management.\\nSo before we start,\\njust a quick review.\\nWhy do we need zero trust in 5G and Open RAN?\\nThe importance is massive.\\nYou know, as 5G and Open RAN,\\nwe have complex network architectures\\nwhich demands robust security.\\nAnd also protecting diverse applications and services\\nin 5G environments are paramount.\\nWe need to have zero trust\\nto protect complex architecture.\\nBut if you look at the zero trust principles,\\nwhat you need to ensure is,\\nyou should never trust\\nand always verify every request\\nthat is coming into your network.\\n\\nYou need to have continuous monitoring,\\nauthentication and authorization.\\nAnd the objective is simple,\\nyou need to have policy-based security control enforcements\\nacross all the network elements.\\nNow let's take a look at some use cases.\\nFirst off, we have to identify,\\nwhat policies do we need?\\nThe policies can be access control policies,\\nmeaning defining who can access what resources\\nbased on their roles.\\nThen you have to implement least privileged principles.\\n\\nYou have to ensure data protection policies are in place.\\nFor example, guidelines for encrypting sensitive data\\nin transit and at rest,\\nand then implementing network segmentation policies\\nfor strategies for micro-segmentation\\nis to isolate services and your applications.\\nAnd also you need to monitor\\nand have incident response policies in place.\\nFor example, you need to have procedures\\nfor continuous monitoring\\nand defining incident response workflows.\\nNow if you have to identify a way to apply policies,\\nyou have to look for the interfaces.\\n\\nSo for user interfaces,\\nthe policies governing user access\\nand authentication methods.\\nThen for the API interfaces,\\nthere should be policies\\nfor API used by applications and services.\\nAs well, for the network interfaces,\\nthe policies should be in place\\nfor securing communication between network elements,\\nexample, RAN, core networks,\\nas well as the management networks as well.\\nFor cloud and edge interfaces,\\nyou need to have policies\\nfor managing security at the cloud,\\nas well as on the edge\\nwhere the computing nodes resides.\\n\\nNow, how to assess the framework\\nfor policy implementation,\\nyou have to have an assessment framework as well.\\nFor example, there should be policy review process in place.\\nWe should have regular audits\\nand assessments of existing policies,\\nyou need to have a risk assessment in place.\\nFor example, you have to evaluate,\\nwhat are the potential threats?\\nAnd then in order for that to happen,\\nyou have to determine\\nthe necessary policy adjustments as well.\\nYou need to have a better stakeholder engagement as well.\\nFor example, in case of stakeholder engagement,\\ncollaborating with cross-functional teams are important.\\n\\nAnd you have to have a feedback mechanism in place.\\nFor example, you need to know\\nhow the channels are established\\nfor continuous feedback and policy improvement.\\nNow, in case of policy design,\\nwhenever you are setting the policy,\\nmake sure that you are having a policy lifecycle management\\nin place,\\nthen the integration with existing frameworks.\\n5G and Open RAN has different frameworks in place,\\nso whatever policy you are designing,\\nit has to be integrated with your existing frameworks.\\nFor example, you have to have user behavior analytics\\nin place.\\n\\nYou have to have identity and access management enhancements\\nto go with threat intelligence integration,\\nand also the role of orchestration and automation\\nneeds to be well-defined.\\nNow that you have understood the policy

clients\\nand IoT on the left hand side,\\nwhich are the end user's accessibility,\\nand then the requests from all those devices are coming\\nto the radio units,\\nas well as to the Open RAN components.\\n\\nNow, what you need to understand,\\nif you look at the policy enforcement points\\nand policy determination points,\\nthat should be all well synced in all these components.\\nFor example, you can have policy enforcements points\\nfor the mobile communication towards radio units.\\nHow do you implement this?\\nYou'll use SUCI for this,\\nwhich is encrypting the traffic\\nwhich is coming from the UI towards the radio units.\\nAs well as you need to have the policy points\\nthat how the request can enter into the network.\\n\\nyou need to have the APA security in place.\\nFor example, any request coming into the network\\nneeds to be authenticated and authorized,\\nand only authorized components should be able to communicate\\nwith each other.\\nAnd you can have different teams accessing these resources.\\nSo for example, how the operations team\\nget into the ORAN components\\nand to the radio units will determine\\nby the policy that whether they're allowed or not.\\nTo explain this part, let's take a look at some use cases.\\nFor example, you have a trust zone,\\nwhich is for the user equipment.\\n\\nThen there are user types,\\nfor example, end users or enterprise users.\\nFor the end user, they're trying to connect\\nto the 5G network for data services.\\nWhat policy you need to enforce?\\nYou need to ensure that user authentication\\nand device posture is checked via the IAM\\nand Privilege Access Management\\nbefore the connection is even allowed.\\nIn case of policy enforcement's points,\\nyou have the 3GPP security controls.\\nFor example, you need to have SUPI\\nand SUCI encryption in place,\\nas well as AKA protocols.\\n\\nAnd this is a medium criticality.\\nWhereas if you know the enterprise user's case,\\nthere is a high criticality\\nbecause enterprise users can access a network from inside.\\nThe use case can be accessing corporate sources\\non a private 5G network.\\nFor those use cases, you need to have an MFA in place\\nand continuous device health checks\\nbefore access is granted.\\nAnd this is a high criticality.\\nDo you know why?\\nFor example, if the enterprise users\\nare accessing the core networks\\nwithout any mutual authentication\\nand NAS security encryption levels,\\nthen the risk is really high.\\n\\nThen if you look at the RAN use cases\\nfor the RAN, Radio Access Network, zone,\\nfor the user type,\\nthat can be network operations or security analyst.\\nThey can be just performing a network maintenance.\\nSo you need to have a role-based access\\nwith time-bound permissions\\nand monitoring of RAN segment activity,\\nmaking sure that the users are accessing\\nonly if they're allowed to do it.\\nYou can also have 3GPP security controls.\\nFor example, for the RAN to-core security interfaces,\\nyou can have N2 and N3 integrity production enabled.\\n\\nWhereas for the security analyst,\\nwhen they want to enter the network,\\nthey should have limited\\nand monitored access with real-time alerts\\nfor abnormal behavior in their RAN traffic.\\nFrom the 3GPP security control perspective,\\nyou need to have RRC signaling security enabled for that,\\nand the

operations.\\nFor the O-RAN service providers,\\nthey can be accessing and managing O-RAN components.\\n\\nSo you need to make sure that zero-trust policy enforcements\\nare in place, such as

the banking customers can be anybody\\nwho wants to access the banking information,\\nand we have applications for those defined.\\nSo in this case, in this architecture,\\nthey can be some content

the request can enter into the network inside.\\n\\nWe need to have, you know, API security enabled\\nfor those use cases,\\nwhereas for the network slice,\\nthe service level authentication defined,\\nwhich means that in case of the request,\\nyou need to make sure that certain quality\\nof services parameters are being provided\\nwhen the request is made.\\nYou need to enforce slice security isolations.\\nFor different slices, they should have\\nmutual authentication between slices,\\nand anybody accessing the information of the slice,\\nwe need to have the RBAC for those use cases as well.\\n\\nNow, if you look at the different categories,\\nyou can have the application service providers\\nas one of your network slice zone.\\nThe use case can be they need to provision a network slice\\nfor a specific application,\\nlet's say, an IoT or an eMBB application.\\nFor the zero-trust policy enforcement,\\nthe role-based access control will be a good thing,\\nand you need to ensure that policies controls\\nare defined for every slice,\\nand what is the intended usage of that.\\nThe 3GPP has also defined the policies\\nand security controls for that,\\nfor example, a slice-specific security policies\\nfor NEF, PCF,\\nwhereas a different policy for a different slice.\\n\\nNow, if you look at the application use cases,\\nthey can be content providers,\\nas well as the customer support team\\nwho wants to access the applications.\\nThe use case can be delivering a multimedia content\\nto the end users,\\nwhereas the customer team needs to have access\\nto those applications to provide support\\nfor operation and maintenance.\\nIn this case, the policy enforcement would be a secure API,\\nthe rate limiting to the request,\\nas well as anomaly detection for application traffic.\\nAnd you can also have user-based policy control\\nand data access restriction to minimize the exposure\\nfor the customer support team.\\n\\nThe 3GPP security controls define some controls as well,\\nwhich you can use as policy enforcement point.\\nFor example, for customer support team,\\nyou can have application function policies enabled\\nas well as HTTPS encryption.\\nFor the content providers,\\nyou can define service-level authentication\\nand API security as specified here.\\nSo the criticality level is medium to low,\\nbecause the customer support

and RU,\\nand their interfaces as well,\\nfor example, E2, A1, O1, and O2.\\nThen you have to define the common components,\\nfor example, the transport network,\\nAPIs or NF communication and external access,\\nand also telemetry and analytics platforms,\\nwhereas you have to also define external users and devices,\\nfor example, subscriber devices, IoT,\\nand external network access points.\\n\\nThen in the next stage, you have to identify the threats.\\nFor example, the components would be listed\\non the left-hand side, which are mapped to threats.\\nNow, in case of 5G core interfaces,\\nthe threat can be an API exploitation\\nleading to an unauthorized NF access.\\nThe STRIDE category will be spoofing and tampering,\\nwhereas if you look at AMF and SMF,\\nthe threat can be an unauthenticated PDU\\nsession establishment and data forwarding.\\nIn the STRIDE category, it will be information disclosure\\nand spoofing.\\n\\nSimilarly, you have to go through each of these components,\\nO-RAN interfaces, RIC, telemetry,\\nall the way towards the transport network.\\nYou have to map down the threats,\\nand put the STRIDE category accordingly.\\nNow, for the zero-trust

communication.\\nYou have to have the attribute-based\\naccess control policies,\\nand then you have to monitor that API traffic\\nwith behavioral analytics.\\n\\nFor AMF, SMF, and PCF,\\nyou have to also integrate the PDP,\\nwhich is a policy decision point, for dynamic authorization.\\nYou have to require continuous authentication\\nfor the PDU sessions,\\nas well as encrypt the control and user

then integrating telemetry data\\nwith zero-trust monitoring tools.\\n\\nAnd for the transport network,\\nyou have to encrypt the traffic using IPSec or MTLS,\\nwhereas to check the monitoring,\\nyou

- [Instructor] The potential for security breaches  \\n was recognized early in the days of mainframes.  \\n In the 1980s, the defense set to develop  \\n the trusted computer security evaluation criteria  \\n as a means of categorizing how much confidence  \\n the security mechanisms in a computer system could provide.  \\n While this transitioned into a more commercial approach,  \\n known as common criteria,  \\n the rapid development of technology combined  \\n with the extended timeframes required for evaluation  \\n meant that products were often out-of-date  \\n by the time they'd been evaluated,  \\n and so few organizations have taken any interest  \\n in using evaluated products.  \\n It's now unclear whether evaluation as a strategy  \\n will have any future in providing confidence in technology.  \\n Outside of the defense sector,  \\n the focus for security was on implementing controls  \\n in the software to detect attempts  \\n to misuse legitimate application functions,  \\n such as making unauthorized payments,  \\n changing account numbers and so on.  \\n The effectiveness of the controls  \\n was checked through formal audits  \\n based on the auditor's IT general controls.  \\n It wasn't until the 1990s  \\n that we began to see system vulnerabilities being exploited  \\n as a real threat to everyday use of computers.  \\n At first, it was just vandalistic pranksters  \\n releasing viruses such as Slammer and Code Red,  \\n which destroyed computer software,  \\n but with the emergence of online systems  \\n involving credit cards and bank account credentials,  \\n organized crime moved in to prey on unsuspecting users  \\n with banking malware such as Zeus  \\n and the evolution into ransomware  \\n such as CryptoLocker and Ryuk.  \\n The use by nation state actors  \\n of malware known as advanced persistent threats, or APTs,  \\n was highlighted in 2013 with the Snowden exposures.  \\n APTs used sophisticated software exploits  \\n to get into a network  \\n and then move from system to system across the network  \\n typically searching for sensitive information.  \\n APTs will do their best to exploit the trust that exists  \\n between components in the network.  \\n One technique used by APTs  \\n is intercepting and reusing session information,  \\n created when a user has logged in.  \\n Another technique is privileged escalation  \\n where the malware exploits software flaws  \\n in order to gain trusted administrator status,  \\n and so have access to all information on the system.  \\n System audits are of limited benefits  \\n in avoiding security breaches,  \\n and the product evaluation approach  \\n to ensuring systems are secure has failed.  \\n Currently, the best practice for ensuring system security  \\n is to carry out penetration testing.  \\n This approach doesn't guarantee that the system is secure,  \\n but it has been effective in making access  \\n more difficult for attackers, and in many cases,  \\n persuading them to move to easier targets.  \\n The aerospace sector has led the way  \\n to applying safety techniques to software development,  \\n and in particular, using the fault mode  \\n and effects analysis approach to identify  \\n and remove software defects.  \\n Other approaches, such as correctness by construction,  \\n an approach championed by practice in the UK,  \\n have demonstrated the ability  \\n to achieve substantial improvements in software quality.  \\n A new approach to achieving trust in technology  \\n is emerging from the UK,  \\n published as British Standard 10754-1:  \\n Information Technology, Systems Trustworthiness.  \\n This is a lifecycle approach using  \\n a trustworthiness framework covering safety,  \\n reliability, resilience and security.  \\n It requires that currently known threats relevant  \\n to the system are understood in terms of tactics,  \\n techniques and practices, or TTPs,  \\n and that a systematic approach is taken  \\n to design and implementation,  \\n including the use of trusted languages  \\n for development and secure coding rules.  \\n Most simple software mistakes are now well known,  \\n and while vulnerabilities are still being found,  \\n modern exploits have to be much more sophisticated.  \\n Once inside the target's network,  \\n these more capable intruders can often continue  \\n to take advantage of internal network trust,  \\n and of course, the insider threat continues  \\n to be a real issue.  \\n Be it an insider innocently clicking on a malicious link  \\n or a disgruntled employee taking advantage  \\n of their legitimate access.  \\n

[Instructor] Software trust is directly related  \\n to the number of defects in the software  \\n that could potentially be exploited.  \\n In this context, a defect is a software floor  \\n which is not detected by testing  \\n prior to release of the software.  \\n And the number of defects per thousand lines  \\n of source code is a typical quality metric  \\n for software development.  \\n In their software construction course,  \\n MIT indicate a typical rate of defects  \\n for industry as a whole  \\n is between one and 10 defects per thousand lines of code.  \\n At the other extreme, safety critical systems are rated  \\n as between one and 10 defects  \\n per hundred thousand lines of code.  \\n However, as we've seen in the case of Boeing  \\n even software that safety critical  \\n may have severe defects.  \\n An early approach to developing trusted software  \\n was to create models of the functional processing  \\n using formal methods specifications such as Z and Malpas.  \\n These specifications are mathematically provable  \\n and so provide a trusted foundation  \\n from which code can be generated.  \\n Unfortunately, formal methods proved to be difficult  \\n for the average programmer  \\n and not scalable beyond few hundred lines of code.  \\n There's little use of formal methods in industry.  \\n A number of more realistic approaches have been proposed  \\n for minimizing defects,  \\n many being based on best practice approaches  \\n to software quality.  \\n These include the Taguchi method,  \\n a collection of design principles  \\n aimed at improving product and process quality.  \\n And is focused on getting the design rights  \\n rather than testing to correct errors.  \\n A key element of the Taguchi methodology  \\n is the concept of quality loss function,  \\n a way of measuring not just the number,  \\n but also the effect of defects.  \\n The Taguchi approach inspired the development  \\n of the design for trustworthy software methodology.  \\n Noting that software development is pure design  \\n as the manufacturing component cost is purely and simply  \\n of a bit by bit copy of the software.  \\n One of the factors that must be taken into account  \\n in designing for trustworthiness,  \\n is the complexity of the software.  \\n The more complex the software,  \\n the more likely that it will contain defects.  \\n There are a number of well-known approaches  \\n to measuring complexity,  \\n the best known being analysis of function points.  \\n In this measurement software characteristics  \\n such as the number of external inputs or transaction types,  \\n the number of reports,  \\n the number of internal and external file interfaces,  \\n and the number of query types are used to calculate  \\n the complexity value.  \\n Another concept incorporated in the design  \\n for trustworthy software  \\n is the Poka-Yoke approach of inspection  \\n and proactive measures to detect problems  \\n before they become defects.  \\n Poka-Yoke is also known as zero defect quality control.  \\n The final concept of the trustworthy design approach  \\n that we'll cover, is quality function deployment.  \\n This is two aims, to ensure that the product  \\n is delivering exactly what is required  \\n and improving the development process itself.  \\n Software QFD is in use by many organizations today  \\n and is characterized by its use of a construct  \\n known as the house of quality diagram.  \\n QFD is now managed by the QFD Institute.  \\n Early problems with the original QFD approach,  \\n particularly in agile environments  \\n have led to development of what's known as blitz QFD.  \\n And the institute has been active  \\n in developing international standards  \\n including ISO 16355,  \\n general principles and perspectives  \\n of quality function deployment.  \\n While design process methods help identify problems  \\n before they become defects,  \\n the most effective approach  \\n to creating low defect software  \\n is by using high integrity languages  \\n such as Ada/spark, Haskell, and Rust.  \\n High integrity languages typically incorporate assertions  \\n which enable automated proving tools  \\n to verify the integrity of the code  \\n and remove many of the traditional vectors for exploits.  \\n Ada has been used extensively in the military,  \\n aerospace, and nuclear industries for many years  \\n and is DOD is preferred language.  \\n Despite evidence that semi-formal designed together  \\n with the use of the Ada/Spark language  \\n is an effective way of achieving very low defect rates,  \\n the wider industry has not embraced Ada,  \\n due you impart to the constraints it applies  \\n to make code more secure, such as strong data typing.  \\n And impart to its reputation  \\n for being a difficult language in which to code.  \\n

NIST provides seven tenants of zero trust  \\n in its special publication 800-207.  \\n And these are the set of principles or beliefs  \\n that a generally held to be true  \\n with respect to zero trust.  \\n All data sources and computing services  \\n are considered resources.  \\n This means that all devices which connect  \\n either directly from inside the organization  \\n or remotely such as personal laptop,  \\n or mobile phones are in scope.  \\n In addition, applications which make machine  \\n to machine requests are also in scope.  \\n All communication is secured regardless of network location.  \\n In simple terms, this means that we don't differentiate  \\n the internal networks from internet access.  \\n And all are required to protect the data being carried.  \\n Access to individual enterprise resources is granted  \\n on a per session basis.  \\n This is a key principle which means any prior access  \\n does not imply that access will be automatically granted.  \\n Every access request has to be authenticated  \\n and authorized.  \\n NIST knows that this could mean sometime recently,  \\n rather than every time.  \\n But that authentication and authorization to one resource  \\n will never automatically grant access  \\n to a different resource.  \\n Access to resources is determined by dynamic policy.  \\n This means that the system will monitor the cyber health  \\n of users, applications, systems and devices.  \\n As well as other behavioral and environmental conditions.  \\n Access policies can also vary based on adjustments  \\n to the sensitivity of the resource or data being accessed.  \\n Least privileged principles are applied  \\n to restrict both visibility and accessibility.  \\n The integrity and security posture of all assets  \\n is monitored.  \\n The security posture or cyber health of all devices  \\n and systems should be monitored using a continuous  \\n diagnostics and mitigation system  \\n with patches and fixes being applied as needed.  \\n The risk of allowing access from devices  \\n that have known vulnerabilities and those not managed  \\n by the enterprise will be taken into account  \\n when making the access decision.  \\n Resource authentication and authorization is dynamic  \\n and strictly enforced.  \\n Not only does this mean identities are authenticated  \\n and they're authoritarians validated before access,  \\n but also the policies which determine  \\n whether access is allowed are continuously updated based  \\n on environmental conditions.  \\n And as much information as possible is collected  \\n about the assets and infrastructure,  \\n maintaining a rich source of information  \\n to enable situational awareness will allow policies  \\n to be updated in order to provide a context  \\n for access requests and improve access decisions.  \\n The NSA Central Security Service has issued its own guidance  \\n on zero trust.  \\n With a focus on its ability to prevent cyber attack.  \\n This is a different perspective focusing on a mindset  \\n which is to assume that we've been breached  \\n and taking steps in advance to limit damage.  \\n The agency suggests principles.  \\n Never trust, always verify,  \\n assume breach and verify explicitly.  \\n The key focus here is to assume a breach  \\n and protect against further damage.  \\n The agency also suggest four design concepts.  \\n Define mission outcomes,  \\n architect from the inside out.  \\n In other words, protect the most important assets first.  \\n Determine access needs and define access policies  \\n and inspect and log all traffic before acting.  \\n In other words, use the environmental data  \\n to inform the access decision.  \\n This diagram from NSA's guidance shows the blocking effect  \\n of a zero trust design.  \\n Making it much more difficult for an adversary.  \\n The UK National Cybersecurity Center has released  \\n a set of 10 principles of zero trust.  \\n These cover the need to know and continuously monitor  \\n the environment and its cybersecurity health.  \\n Having strong identities,  \\n assuming no trust and using policies to authorize  \\n and authenticate.  \\n And using solutions which are zero trust capable.  \\n The open group is currently developing  \\n a set of guidance documents on zero trust.  \\n And these will be issued in due course  \\n in the form of a landscape, manifesto  \\n and reference architecture.  \\n The first of the open group publications  \\n is the zero trust core principles.  \\n There are 10 core principles grouped into four themes.  \\n The first theme, is organizational value and risk alignment.  \\n With the first three principles of aligning zero trust  \\n with a modern mobile and remote working style  \\n and aligning with business goals and risks.  \\n The second theme is guardrails and governance  \\n which has the bulk of the principles.  \\n This theme is about guiding the adoption of zero trust  \\n within an environment of rapidly evolving compliance  \\n and regulatory needs, lagging industry controls  \\n and compliance standards.  \\n Increasing complexity and the need  \\n to automate data collection, traceability and processes.  \\n The third theme is technology  \\n and focuses on the area of access control and privileges.  \\n And the last theme,  \\n is delivering simple and pervasive security.  \\n Cloud is a major technology  \\n and so any zero trust architecture  \\n needs to be able to work in the cloud.  \\n We'll come back to cloud later in the course,  \\n but for now let's take a quick look at the AWS  \\n guiding principles for zero trust.  \\n The first guiding principle is that network controls  \\n and perimeters remain important to the overall  \\n security architecture.  \\n The choice isn't between being identity centric  \\n and network centric,  \\n but using both effectively and in combination.  \\n The second is that zero trust may mean different things  \\n in different contexts.  \\n The use case of using a browser and a mobile app to connect  \\n to an internet facing business system  \\n and the use case of eating carefully micro segmented  \\n architectures in a cloud backend deployment  \\n are quite different from a zero trust perspective.  \\n The third principle is that zero trust must be applied  \\n with the organizational context  \\n and the value to the organization in mind.  \\n Zero trust is like any of the control  \\n and it needs to be proportional.  \\n It shouldn't inhibit the business to the point  \\n where the cost of using zero trust is more than the value  \\n of what it's protecting.  \\n Microsoft also based their approach  \\n on three zero trust principles.  \\n Verify explicitly using a range of available data  \\n to make the access decisions.  \\n Use least privileged to provide just enough access  \\n and do it just in time.  \\n Assume you'll have a breach,  \\n so segment the network in advance to contain any damage  \\n and use encryption to protect data.  \\n For Google, BeyondCorp is zero trust.  \\n There are three BeyondCorp zero trust principles.  \\n Firstly, access to services must not be determined  \\n by the network from which you connect.  \\n The result of this is that all access should be assumed  \\n to be from untrusted networks.  \\n Access to services is granted based on contextual factors  \\n from the user in their device.  \\n This implies a level of monitoring to establish context  \\n and the access decision takes into account both the user  \\n and the device from which they're requesting access.  \\n And the third principle is that access to services  \\n must be authenticated, authorized and encrypted.

[Instructor] In May, 2018, the Industry Advisory Committee  \\n of the American Council for Technology  \\n was asked to produce a report on the potential adoption  \\n of Zero Trust by federal agencies.  \\n The report concluded that Zero Trust is a mature strategy,  \\n that an effective Zero Trust deployment can significantly  \\n improve an agency's cybersecurity posture,  \\n and that it would have a positive  \\n cybersecurity return on investment.  \\n However, it also noted that there would be many challenges  \\n in implementing such a strategy  \\n and these would need careful consideration  \\n prior to its adoption  \\n in a mission critical, multi organizational scenario.  \\n The report took into account the various tenets  \\n and principles of Zero Trust that have been published  \\n and developed a conceptual model of Zero Trust  \\n which takes the form of six pillars.  \\n The first pillar describes the requirement  \\n for ongoing authentication of trusted users  \\n by continuously monitoring  \\n and validating their trustworthiness  \\n for having access rights and privileges.  \\n The cybersecurity posture on trustworthiness  \\n of devices is the second pillar.  \\n This may involve examination of the device software version,  \\n configuration, and patch levels.  \\n Network perimeters in Zero Trust  \\n should move in from the network edge  \\n in order to isolate critical data and services,  \\n and so networks is the third pillar.  \\n Multiple perimeters should be implemented  \\n through micro-segmentation to strengthen the inner network.  \\n The application layer is another pillar  \\n with compute containers and virtual machines  \\n offering the ability to encapsulate applications  \\n and facilitate more granular and accurate access decisions.  \\n Multifactor authentication provides more robust  \\n access control to applications.  \\n The fifth pillar is automation.  \\n Security automation, sometimes called orchestration,  \\n connects the use of security tools through a tested workflow  \\n and assists in managing many different security systems.  \\n Good security orchestration will reduce manual effort,  \\n improve incident response times, and reduce costs.  \\n Finally, analytics enable the development  \\n of situational awareness so that security systems  \\n can observe and react in real time  \\n to events around and on the network.  \\n In addition to providing a conceptual model,  \\n the report notes the need for a Zero Trust deployment  \\n to be supported by a trust engine,  \\n which can calculate a trust score  \\n for a user, device or application.  \\n It also identifies micro-segmentation as necessary  \\n for using fine-grained access policies.  \\n The report identifies the need for a Zero Trust approach  \\n to adopt a control plane/data plane model,  \\n similar to the approach taken  \\n by telecommunications providers for managing networks.  \\n In this case, the control plane is used  \\n to receive and process requests  \\n for access and to configure the data plane  \\n to allow or deny the requests.  \\n The report identifies six benefits of adopting Zero Trust.  \\n A more secure network,  \\n by taking the never trust, always check approach.  \\n A focus on safer data by highlighting the importance  \\n of protecting data in transit and at rest.  \\n Improved protection against existing and evolving threats  \\n through taking a deny by default approach.  \\n Reduce the impact of a breach with micro-segmentation,  \\n containing the damage should an incident occur.  \\n And improve compliance and visibility  \\n through segmenting specific data  \\n and having more focus on data inventories.  \\n The report concludes by presenting insights  \\n into how Zero Trust can be implemented  \\n and some challenges for federal agencies in adopting it,  \\n particularly for mission critical systems.  \\n It notes Zero Trust is an evolutionary framework  \\n which builds on existing security concepts  \\n and doesn't introduce a radically new approach  \\n to cybersecurity.  \\n The US government's Cyber Infrastructure Security Agency  \\n in 2021 released a draft of its model of Zero Trust  \\n which is the same as that of the ACTIAC,  \\n but omits the pillars of automation and analytics.  \\n Together with the

the three stages of maturity.  \\n The guidance is provided as six processes per pillar  \\n as shown in this example of the device pillar.  \\n Here we see the missing areas  \\n of automation and analytics,  \\n together with compliance, data access,  \\n asset management, and governance.  \\n In traditional maturity model terms  \\n the three CISA ratings are ad hoc,  \\n repeatable, and

 \\n limit access, both using just-in-time access checks  \\n and just-enough-access privileges;  \\n assume your network has been breached  \\n and segment to minimize the damage.  \\n In their book  \\n on the \\\"Zero Trust Journey Across the Digital Estate,\\\"  \\n Abbas Kudrati and Binil Pillai explore Zero Trust  \\n with a focus on the Microsoft model.  \\n One of their primary messages  \\n is that \\\"identity is the new security control plane.\\\"  \\n In other words, identity is at the center of everything  \\n in a Zero Trust environment.  \\n Let's take a look at the Microsoft model of Zero Trust.  \\n Identities and endpoints request access  \\n from the Zero Trust policy engine  \\n which explicitly verifies using telemetry from many sources  \\n relating to user profile, location, device compliance,  \\n data sensitivity, application sensitivity,  \\n threat protection telemetry, and much more.  \\n Policy is then enforced at the time of access  \\n and continuously evaluated throughout the session.  \\n Policy optimization provides the Zero Trust policy engine  \\n with services to monitor governance, compliance,  \\n and security posture assessment.  \\n While the threat protection module  \\n takes sensor telemetry and analytics  \\n enriched by threat intelligence feeds  \\n and provides high-quality risk assessment  \\n to the Zero Trust policy engine,  \\n the request then navigates the network segments  \\n to reach the data, application,  \\n or infrastructure it requires.  \\n Microsoft have adopted  \\n a Zero Trust maturity assessment approach  \\n based on this model.  \\n So let's have a look at the associated tool  \\n from Deakin University in Australia  \\n that we can use to support this.  \\n This is available in your exercise files.  \\n The maturity assessment tool has eight dimensions  \\n covering the elements of Zero Trust:  \\n Identity, endpoints and devices,  \\n application and workload,  \\n data, network, infrastructure,  \\n visibility and analytics,  \\n and automation and orchestration.  \\n Each dimension has a number of critical success factors.  \\n A risk score is calculated  \\n for each of the critical success factors  \\n and used to determine the overall effectiveness.  \\n Let's examine the first of the dimensions  \\n as presented in the tool.  \\n The first dimension is identity.  \\n This includes 10 individual factors  \\n which need to be taken into account  \\n when determining the level of identity risk.  \\n For example,  \\n critical success factor ID8  \\n addresses how often administrative privileges are reviewed.  \\n We can assign a rating of between one,  \\n limited or no deployment,  \\n through to five, for full deployment.  \\n We give each critical success factor a maturity weight  \\n which reflects its level of relevance  \\n to Zero Trust maturity.  \\n The average maturity  \\n represents the maturity level which is expected,  \\n against which we'll compare our maturity rating  \\n to identify the gap.  \\n We then use this as an input to the risk assessment.  \\n Together, with the impact and likelihood of a risk  \\n against this critical success factor.  \\n To the right of the sheet,  \\n we find the ratings and weightings  \\n for each of the critical success factors.  \\n Let's change one of the ratings  \\n and watch the associated gap value change.  \\n Okay, we'll change this back now.  \\n We also find on this sheet the preset values  \\n for risk assessment of each of the critical success factors.  \\n The maturity and risk elements  \\n in this part of the spreadsheet  \\n then drive the calculations  \\n in the Risk Scenario Assessment sheet.  \\n This sheet shows the assessment  \\n based on a number of risk scenarios  \\n in which the risk relevance varies.  \\n We'll look at just the first one.  \\n ID8 is assessed as having a risk score of 2.4,  \\n which has been calculated as the total risk  \\n divided by the rated maturity.  \\n The effectiveness is calculated from the rating  \\n and factored by a risk relevance weighting.  \\n This results in an effectiveness of 4;  \\n the maximum effectiveness, in this case.  \\n By taking all critical success factors,  \\n the overall maturity assessment of the identity dimension  \\n appears as 56%.  \\n The gap between the effectiveness  \\n and the maximum effectiveness which is possible  \\n can be used to prioritize enhancement  \\n to the Zero Trust approach.  \\n We can see that ID6 has an assessed effectiveness of 1.2,  \\n but a potential effectiveness of 6  \\n and would therefore be a candidate for priority improvement.  \\n Let's briefly look at the second dimension,  \\n which is Endpoint/Devices.  \\n This has eight critical success factors  \\n covering device enrollment, access verification,  \\n and endpoint security.  \\n It also includes the requirements for a SIEM to be in place  \\n to monitor for endpoint attacks.  \\n The critical success factors EN4 and EN5  \\n essentially cover the Zero Trust requirement  \\n for endpoint trust assessment.  \\n We won't go through every sheet,  \\n but do take the time to do that  \\n after you finish this course.  \\n In order to become familiar  \\n with each of the dimensions in the tool.  \\n The tool provides a useful insight  \\n into the industry perspective  \\n on what makes Zero Trust an effective approach  \\n in today's business environment.  \\n Carrying out assessments  \\n based on these critical success factors  \\n allows us to snapshot the current state  \\n of Zero Trust maturity for an organization  \\n and identify specific areas of enhancement  \\n to help work in a risk-informed way  \\n towards a fully Zero Trust target architecture.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2895527\",\"duration\":166,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Policy-based admission control\",\"fileName\":\"2884227_02_04_XR30_Policy_based_control\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"RFC2753: Policy-based Admission Control was published in January 2000 and describes the key policy elements of Zero Trust.

[Instructor] Let's take a look at the context  \\n in which Zero Trust might deployed.  \\n Some systems are deployed as wholly private systems  \\n with all access being mediated.  \\n And these are ideal for applying Zero Trust principles.  \\n The majority of organizations will have a static website  \\n which is internet-facing located in a DMZ  \\n and designed for anonymous access,  \\n even though the access may be from a threat source.  \\n This is generally out of scope for Zero Trust.  \\n However, some websites may reach back into backend systems  \\n to retrieve or post data,  \\n a not unusual situation for E-commerce sites.  \\n This presents a threat, as internet-facing websites  \\n are commonly used as footholds  \\n to gain access further into corporate networks.  \\n Furthermore, some websites act as proxies  \\n for internal applications.  \\n Clearly, Zero Trust plays a part here,  \\n but we need to think carefully about where.  \\n A great way to think about the business context is to use  \\n the Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture, SABSA.  \\n SABSA includes an approach to developing  \\n entity and trust relationship models,  \\n which can be traced back to business outcomes  \\n and forward to security solutions.  \\n This makes it an ideal tool to consider  \\n where Zero Trust can be used in a business context.  \\n We won't go into the detail of SABSA here  \\n but if you want to learn more, check out my course  \\n on Using SABSA to Architect Secure Cloud.  \\n Let's think about a typical website  \\n which offers anonymous browsing of products, customer login,  \\n and online ordering of goods.  \\n The vendor wants to encourage access  \\n to the website at any time  \\n without the need to register or login.  \\n It must be available and accessible.  \\n The customer wants to be assured  \\n that the products are accurately described, correctly priced  \\n and that the stock levels are correct.  \\n The information on the website isn't sensitive,  \\n but the vendor needs to make sure  \\n it's not changed without authority.  \\n And of course that the website isn't maliciously used  \\n to send spam or malware.  \\n The business also wants to maximize sales.  \\n When the customer decides to order,  \\n they want to sure they can do so without too much fuss,  \\n but at the same time to know that their credentials  \\n are kept confidential.  \\n When they place their order using their credit card,  \\n they'll want to know their card details are not disclosed.  \\n The vendor needs to know that the credit card is authentic  \\n and the payment has been authorized.  \\n Finally, the customer needs to know the delivery  \\n will be accurate and timely.  \\n So, we can break down the simple purchase transaction  \\n into a set of attributes which need to be met.  \\n These represent real business security  \\n in the SABSA framework.  \\n There are three that we need to consider  \\n from a Zero Trust perspective:  \\n Integrity assured, which requires that we have Zero Trust  \\n in any access to the server.  \\n Authentic, which we will verify using Zero Trust mechanisms.  \\n And authorized, which we will again want to verify  \\n using Zero Trust mechanisms.  \\n Let's see what this might look like in a cloud deployment.  \\n We'll typically see a load balancer  \\n as the first point of contact.  \\n We don't need to authenticate,  \\n as we're expecting anonymous access.  \\n The load balancer will then connect to the web server.  \\n In AWS, for example, it will do this using a security group  \\n which ensures that no other point in the DMZ  \\n can access the web server.  \\n This is an example of micro-segmentation  \\n and it's pretty common in cloud deployments.  \\n The web server will then connect to the backend application.  \\n Again, via a security group.  \\n Again, the application server has been micro-segmented  \\n to protect against lateral access  \\n because the only source from which access can occur  \\n is the web server.  \\n The application then connects to the database.  \\n And again, a security group provides micro-segmentation.  \\n A cloud service such as AWS provides a great foundation  \\n for Zero Trust.  \\n Onto this foundation, we can then add  \\n a policy decision and enforcement point subsystem  \\n to complete our Zero Trust deployment.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2889502\",\"duration\":164,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Zero Trust data\",\"fileName\":\"2884227_02_06_XR30_Data\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Zero Trust not only assumes everyone on the network is untrusted, it also assumes everyone accessing the data is untrusted.

untrusted software  \\n that allows easy exploitation anyway.  \\n The first principle is that all users  \\n shall be considered subjects  \\n for which access is to be mediated.  \\n This includes staff working in the enterprise,  \\n staff working remotely, special category staff,  \\n such as contractors and partners.  \\n All will be managed in the same way.  \\n Autonomous endpoints will be considered subjects  \\n for which access will be mediated.  \\n In other words, a machine, application sensor,  \\n or artificial intelligence agent will all be treated  \\n in the same way as human users requesting access.  \\n All endpoint devices from which access requests come  \\n shall be subject to health checks.  \\n This will include software version and patch levels  \\n as well as the type of device, its location, and so on.  \\n All data stores and computing services  \\n to which access is requested our objects  \\n and will have a micro-segmented perimeter  \\n around the resource and be accessed  \\n via a policy enforcement point.  \\n All data on the communications  \\n from endpoint device to the object  \\n should be or be made nonsensitive.  \\n The data may be secured  \\n with encryption or otherwise desensitized.  \\n We need to recognize that some endpoint devices  \\n such as IoT sensors may be used to transmit sensitive data,  \\n but won't have the capability to desensitize it.  \\n And this should be taken into account  \\n when making the access decision.  \\n Access to individual enterprise resources is granted  \\n on a per resource per session basis.  \\n There'll be no trust assumptions that carry over  \\n from one session to the next,  \\n nor across objects in a session.  \\n This achieves just-in-time access.  \\n Privileges to carry out the requested action are granted  \\n on a per resource per session basis.  \\n Only the minimum privileges should be provided  \\n to meet the just enough access approach.  \\n The policies governing the access and privileges decision  \\n are dynamic and may change based on  \\n the observable state of the environment.  \\n These are called adaptive access policies.  \\n The environment in this context means  \\n the cyber health and behavior of subjects and objects  \\n as well as data received from monitoring network traffic.  \\n As much information as possible is collected,  \\n including the current state of network infrastructure,  \\n threat intelligence, and traffic patterns.  \\n This is then analyzed to gain situational awareness  \\n and better support the adaptive access policies.  \\n The security mechanisms used  \\n to achieve zero trust will be trustworthy.  \\n It's not good enough for them  \\n to have industry standard levels of defects.  \\n They have to be high integrity in order to enable  \\n the zero trust architecture to achieve good security.  \\n While developing software in accordance  \\n with secure coding rules is a good start,  \\n application of a formal standard  \\n such as British Standard 10754-1 would be desirable.  \\n Zero trust is more than just a set of tenants or principles.  \\n Most of the technology needed to deploy  \\n a zero trust environment has been around for some years,  \\n such as cloud-based micro-segmentation  \\n and privileged access managers  \\n providing single use administrative credentials.  \\n Anomaly detection systems and big data security analytics  \\n exist already in product form.  \\n Clouds already have scripted security policies  \\n which are used to make authorization decisions.  \\n The concepts of policy decision  \\n and enforcement points has been understood for a long time.  \\n First being introduced in RFC 2753,  \\n a framework for policy-based admission control  \\n in January, 2000.  \\n What zero trust has done is to establish an approach  \\n which brings policy-based access together  \\n into a model of just-in-time access  \\n and just enough access,  \\n which works seamlessly with feedback  \\n to enable security monitoring to continuously adjust  \\n the adaptive access policies.  \\n We can see in this model the elements that make up  \\n the adaptive policy aspects of the model.  \\n The monitoring model continuously checks  \\n the state of the environment,  \\n adjusting policies as it goes  \\n and feeding them to the policy enforcement point.  \\n When a request comes in from the subject and endpoint,  \\n the policy will be enforced.  \\n If the decision is to allow access,  \\n temporary credentials will be delivered  \\n to the subject and the object  \\n enabling the connection to be made  \\n via the perimeter device as normal.  \\n As we see more advanced orchestration of deployments,  \\n adapting artificial intelligence techniques  \\n to reason about the state of the environment at scale,  \\n we're going to have AI driven dynamic policies  \\n becoming the norm.  \\n With this will come many more challenges  \\n as we strive to not only protect our data and services,  \\n but also maintain control of our technology.  \\n Already with cloud-based policy access,
