Imagine you automatically adding project tasks  \\n to your team's calendar,  \\n or even better reprioritizing them  \\n based on their criticality to the project,  \\n all of this automatically.  \\n Starting now, I will share with you  \\n some tools and applications using AI  \\n that could really leverage your work.  \\n I just need you to be mindful of one thing.  \\n New tools are being released as we speak.  \\n I did my best to select tools that reflect  \\n the potential of AI in project management.  \\n Maybe in the future, these tools will not exist  \\n or will be replaced by new ideas.  \\n It's an evolving market.  \\n But now,  \\n can you imagine doing a brainstorming session using AI  \\n to create the scope of your project in a blink of an eye?  \\n This is the power of generative AI in project planning.  \\n Let me give you some examples.  \\n You can use a tool like ChatGPT in natural language  \\n to craft the scope of your new project.  \\n And when I say natural language,  \\n I'm saying you do not need formal code or language.  \\n You just ask as you ask any human.  \\n For example, you can access ChatGPT and type,  \\n Suggest the first level of a work breakdown structure  \\n of a new house I want to build for my family.  \\n Please split the work by types  \\n of work required in the house.  \\n You will see a very decent draft of WBS for your project.  \\n A second example, type,  \\n I created the first level of the WBS of my new home:  \\n foundation,  \\n walls,  \\n plumbing,  \\n electrical works,  \\n carpentry,  \\n painting,  \\n and finishing.  \\n Am I missing something?  \\n You will be amazed by the results.  \\n And remember, you can do this in practically any language.  \\n It's essential to highlight that the prompt  \\n of what you type in your chat  \\n drives the quality of the results.  \\n You will find thousands of tips on how to do that online.  \\n I always have in mind the CSIF acronym.  \\n C stands for the context of what you need to work.  \\n S means specific.  \\n You need to provide detailed information  \\n about what you need.  \\n The letter I stands for intent.  \\n It's your goal.  \\n What do you want the AI to do?  \\n And F means format.  \\n It's how you want the results to be.  \\n An example of a poorly written prompt on ChatGPT could be:  \\n Prepare the scope of my new house project.  \\n On the other side, an excellent prompt would be:  \\n I'm building a new house to live in with my family  \\n in Bangalore, India.  \\n Detail the project by the different types of work.  \\n And please produce a work breakdown structure  \\n with three levels of depth and one item per line  \\n in the format I can copy and paste into Microsoft Project.  \\n I am sure that even if you knew each part of the scope,  \\n just writing them would take you more time than using GPT.  \\n And working with schedule is about the same.  \\n You can use ChatGPT in order to list tasks,  \\n suggest relationships, et cetera.  \\n But you can use tools like Motion to schedule  \\n any type of work among your team members automatically  \\n based on the priority of the work and their availability.  \\n The tool will analyze the available time slots  \\n for each resource.  \\n It'll evaluate the priority of the task  \\n and populate your calendar with the assigned time slots.  \\n And of course, it will do this not only for you  \\n but for everybody in the project  \\n and will respect all the relationships  \\n you defined for each task.  \\n And even better, if one of your resources  \\n does not complete the task in the defined timeframe,  \\n it'll automatically reschedule all future work  \\n for everyone in seconds.  \\n No manual planning is required.  \\n And this, this is not science fiction.  \\n It's not something to the future.  \\n It's what is happening and it's happening now.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4487992\",\"duration\":293,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using automated reporting to improve communications\",\"fileName\":\"4474080_en_US_01_02_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":17545029,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

Thank you so much.  \\n And certainly the last year  \\n and several months have been completely  \\n transformative in this space.  \\n You and I spoke several months ago  \\n and you were referring to the possibilities  \\n and the future, and this is coming.  \\n And now we're here  \\n and we want to talk about the present.  \\n Can you talk a little bit about this evolution,  \\n just even in the last several months?  \\n - Yeah, I remember us talking  \\n and saying, oh, this is, people are working on this.  \\n This will change that, now it's already changing.  \\n So now we are not talking about AI as a word  \\n of possibilities.  \\n We are now talking about AI as a reality.  \\n Every single organization is concerned about AI,  \\n is investing in some ways in AI.  \\n It's not part of the past.  \\n AI just became mainstream for any sector,  \\n any type of business, and even any type of project.  \\n So what is the difference between five months ago  \\n and now?  \\n Five months ago, a lot of people say, is this a bubble?  \\n And the answer, no, this is the way the future will be.  \\n I think that pretty much everybody in the project management  \\n sector knows how serious we are talking about the change.  \\n Now we need to go to the second step.  \\n It's okay, how do I get ready for that?  \\n What AI is doing, it's changing the way people work,  \\n and it's not changing the way project managers work.  \\n It's the way your supplier work, the way your client,  \\n the way you manage stakeholders, the way  \\n and expectations of your employees, your team members,  \\n the way your organization operates.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4599033\",\"duration\":146,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Using Magic ToDo to break down complex projects\",\"fileName\":\"4583000_en_US_01_02_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":146,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"includesPickups\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"hasSlides\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":false,\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":4540892,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

This is the first piece.  \\n The second one is how you customize your instructions.  \\n You give all the instructions, and what is the difference?  \\n On ChatGPT,  \\n they do not even know  \\n what instructions they should follow.  \\n They know OpenAI instructions.  \\n - Right. - Because OpenAI,  \\n for example, if you ask something  \\n about copyright or something like that,  \\n OpenAI may say. \\\"I cannot answer that.\\\"  \\n For example, if you ask a very polemic question,  \\n this why ChatGPT will not answer,  \\n because OpenAI gave that instruction.  \\n On the instruction that that OpenAI has, they did that.  \\n On the custom GPT, actually you are doing the same,  \\n but you are putting your own.  \\n For example, avoid giving opinion on something, you know,  \\n and be very fact-based.  \\n Put numbers on every single answer.  \\n Make sure you read document x.pdf  \\n for every single answer you give,  \\n and then you can put your corporate policies there.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4597042\",\"duration\":413,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Creating a Custom GPT to assess project management risks\",\"fileName\":\"4583000_en_US_01_04_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":413,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"includesPickups\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"hasSlides\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":false,\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":16258510,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - This is the screen of a new GPT, okay?

 \\n \\\"I want a GPT  \\n that helps project managers  \\n inside my company  \\n to identify and analyze risks.\\\"  \\n Let me, analyze risks.  \\n Okay, GPT Builder.  \\n Okay, it's starting to create for me the GPT.  \\n Of course, I could have written much more information,  \\n but let's just to make it short here for you  \\n to see how fast I can do something interesting here,  \\n and then you can refine later.  \\n So I'm updating, okay, my GPT.  \\n A Risk Navigator, it's suggesting the name.  \\n \\\"Please use Project Risk Navigator.\\\"  \\n Just to change it.  \\n Okay, good.  \\n So I'm starting with the name of the GPT,  \\n and now, the GPT Builder is generating a picture  \\n that will be on the top of these square here,  \\n so people will identify, it's like an avatar of my own GPT.  \\n So I'll wait.  \\n Okay, let's see what picture.  \\n And it created.  \\n But look, on this side, already has the questions,  \\n \\\"How I can identify?  \\n Can you help analyze?  \\n What are the common risks in construction projects?\\\"  \\n Did you see?  \\n This was created by the GPT Builder.  \\n For example, what do you think about this one?  \\n Great, so I'm just saying I like the picture.  \\n Of course, you can change it later,  \\n but let me just go up to the end until I share this.  \\n So I'm using, for example,  \\n I can refine what types of industries.  \\n For example, here, \\\"We work in infrastructure  \\n and construction.  \\n We want risks related to civil,  \\n electrical, mechanical,  \\n environmental,  \\n and other related.  \\n We want to look for  \\n and analyze risks.\\\"  \\n Okay, then I do that.  \\n I'm just explaining and talking, because now, it's narrowing  \\n to infrastructure and construction.  \\n It could be any topic, okay, any related.  \\n So it's already analyzing for me and creating a custom view.  \\n And then, I can say which kind of,  \\n for example, of instructions do you want, for example.  \\n I can say, \\\"Avoid mentioning,\\\"  \\n I'm just using this as an example, \\\"political risks.  \\n Please make sure that you discuss global risks.\\\"  \\n Or, \\\"Make sure that you discuss about,\\\"  \\n for example, \\\"global trade risks.\\\"  \\n And conversation tones, so for example, \\\"Be informal,  \\n write in simple English,  \\n be direct and clear  \\n in your suggestions.  \\n Be friendly, but direct.  \\n Short answers are better than longer answers.\\\"  \\n Okay.  \\n Then, this, okay?  \\n So it's already updating the GPT,  \\n and when it's ready, I will have a link,  \\n or I can publish this on the GPT Store.  \\n Of course, if this is corporate,  \\n this is not, for example, for the public use,  \\n but for example,  \\n quick tips for severe project risks, brief analysis.  \\n Did you see that it changed this to the context of my risks?  \\n Yeah, and look, if I click on Configure,  \\n did you see that everything was filled?  \\n And then, I can upload files here as we speak.  \\n You can use PDFs, Microsoft,  \\n Excel, PowerPoint, this kind of files, but honestly,  \\n very soon, it'll be an audio,  \\n for example, you can put a lecture here  \\n of you teaching people how to use,  \\n for example, your methodology, you can put everything.  \\n And you can access and make available,  \\n for example, the Code Interpreter.  \\n And this is the tool that brings  \\n a little bit of math to that.  \\n So you can put here and upload as many files as you need.  \\n Currently, this version for the normal user, it's 20 files,  \\n but you can combine these files.  \\n So you can combine and you can have,  \\n I would say a very decent set layer of information  \\n that will go on the top of the GPT.  \\n And if you come here and save,  \\n for example, I will not save for everyone,  \\n but I will put anyone and confirm.  \\n I'm just using this as an example.  \\n So what happened?

 \\n What are the critical steps of recovering a trouble project?  \\n For example, my project is over budget and also late.  \\n What are the key things I need to evaluate  \\n to decide if I should move forward or cancel the project?  \\n For example, I'm in trouble.  \\n I don't know what points should I move forward or ask.  \\n For example, Goldratt the author of \\\"The Goal,\\\"  \\n the book said, \\\"The first thing  \\n that you should do when you are  \\n inside a hole is stop digging.\\\"  \\n So when it's time for you to just stop digging,  \\n and let's see what PMOtto will come.  \\n I never asked this question, okay?  \\n I never asked.  \\n So it's my first time.  \\n So this is PMO.  \\n So PMOtto is comparing this with our library  \\n and also with GPT.  \\n So look, it's saying.  \\n Look, when a project,  \\n it's crucial to reassess its viability.  \\n So understand root analysis, a project status,  \\n cost to complete analysis,  \\n that cost to complete analysis is the concept of TCP, TCPI.  \\n It's two complete performance index.  \\n It's how much better you need to be in the future  \\n to recover your losses.  \\n So resources, availability and this.  \\n So this is just an example.  \\n We want to address this to the global community,  \\n and not everybody is fluent with all terms in English.  \\n So we try to make something simple  \\n that people can understand, that people can analyze  \\n and can relate to, and this is an example  \\n of a custom GPD that people can do.  \\n You can do like a help desk, a project help desk,  \\n and you can use a tool like this one  \\n that people can benefit.  \\n Instead of calling you or using human interaction,  \\n you can use this as a first layer of response.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5900051\",\"duration\":126,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"What are some best practices in developing custom GPTs?\",\"fileName\":\"4583000_en_US_01_06_VT\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"rawDurationSeconds\":127,\"solutionVideo\":false,\"handoutGraphicsIncluded\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"includesPickups\":false,\"challengeVideo\":false,\"hasSlides\":false,\"graphicsIncluded\":false,\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"includesAlternateFootage\":false},\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":9104037,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - The first thing, you don't develop, and it's done.  \\n It's a continuous process, every single day.  \\n Just today, I received a couple of messages  \\n from people using PMOtto saying,  \\n \\\"Ricardo, this didn't work very well.\\\"  \\n And then this becomes future instructions  \\n because you know, look, we can fix everything.  \\n For example, look, in the past.  \\n In the past, when we used DALL-E,  \\n that is the drawing aboard of OpenAI,  \\n you say, \\\"successful people,\\\"  \\n most of the answers were white people wearing suits.  \\n and that, you know.  \\n Now you don't find that anymore.  \\n Why?

[Instructor] In the first chapter,\\nwe put the foundations in place\\nfor optimal use of AI technologies in project management.\\nNow it's time to put these tools to work.\\nIdentifying what stakeholders need to be kept updated,\\nhow and when on a project is key to managing expectations\\nand ensuring accurate and timely reporting.\\nThis is the first way you can streamline your work with AI.\\n\\nYou can refer to the prompt template handout\\nin the exercise files folder\\nto discover the kind of prompts you can use\\nthroughout the stakeholder analysis process.\\nLet's look at how we can do this through AI.\\nFirst, start by pinpointing the right stakeholders\\nfor your project.\\nEffective identification ensures everyone\\nwho needs to be in the loop is informed.\\nI have now opened up ChatGPT and started a new chat.\\n\\nI'm now going to show you an example prompt that we can use\\nand then I'll walk you through\\nexactly why I included what I did\\nand then we can also look at the output too.\\nGenerate a list of potential stakeholders\\nfor 'project alpha.'\\nNote, I've put those in these little quotation marks\\njust to give the tool insight\\nthat this is kind of key information\\nrelating to our project.\\n\\nBased on the following project objective.\\nNow at this point, you need to be specific\\nand provide the tool with your exact use case.\\nSo for the purpose of this demo,\\nI'm going to put an example objective in.\\nThe objective of this project is to onboard\\n25 new clients to our new financial product.\\n\\nAnd then once you are happy with that,\\nyou can either hit the enter key\\nor you can press send message.\\nAt this point, we just need to wait for the tool\\nto submit the output that we can then leverage.\\nAs you can see,\\nit is broken it down by internal stakeholders\\nand the various different departments\\nand also external stakeholders\\nand just some others that we may need to consider too,\\nsuch as regulatory bodies or investors.\\n\\nThere's also a section here\\non the importance of stakeholder engagement\\nand why each stakeholder needs to be kept informed\\nand their general role on this project.\\nNext, we can set up some stakeholder\\ncommunication plan prompting.\\nCreating a communication plan\\nwill ensure that you provide the right insights\\nto the right stakeholders at the right time.\\nI have now navigated back to ChatGPT,\\nand I'm going to leverage the existing chat\\nthat we just set up, so the former prompt and output\\nbecause this way we can kind of speed up\\nour response that we are looking for.\\n\\nAnd not only that,\\nit should be a lot more optimal from the outset\\nbecause it's using the existing history\\nof what it's provided to us\\nand what we have kind of inputted in.\\nSo as an example, when I put this future prompt in,\\nit will already know\\nthat this is the objective of the project.\\nThis is priming in essence.\\nSo here's the second prompt.\\nDraft a communication strategy\\nthat includes frequency,\\nmethods,\\nand key messages\\nfor each stakeholder group.\\n\\nAnd then hit that submit button.\\nAgain, we need to wait for the output here.\\nSo as you can see, it's working through it.\\nBut what it's essentially done here is it's broken again\\nthe output into the internal and external stakeholders.\\nIt's given us a range of different communication methods,\\nwhen we should be sending those communications\\nand some of the key messages\\nthat we are going to want to include.\\nSo this can just direct us and give us an idea\\nand understanding of what we need to do and when\\nwith which particular stakeholders.\\n\\nAnd at the bottom, we've got a conclusion,\\nwhich is just rounding up everything\\nthat's kind of been contained\\nand why we need to take\\nall of the above information on board.\\nThirdly, there is stakeholder reporting prompting.\\nRegular updates are vital\\nfor keeping stakeholders engaged and informed.\\nA templated report streamlined the process,\\nmaking it efficient and consistent.\\nSo again, I've headed back into ChatGPT,\\nand as you would expect,\\nI'm also going to work from the existing chat\\nbecause we have those two former prompts and responses.\\n\\nSo we are already primed\\nand in a good position for this prompt.\\nAt this point, we are going to ask the tool a question.\\nYou can always do this to get ideas as to where you go next.\\nWhat stakeholder reports do I need to produce\\nfor who and when?\\nSo here we are getting some recommendations\\nbased on the different stakeholders.\\n\\nFor instance,\\nthe project team require weekly status reports.\\nSenior management require a monthly executive summary\\nor quarterly strategic reviews.\\nSo it's also given us options as well.\\nIt's also talking about the content we should include,\\nthe purpose and the frequency.\\nWhat we could do at this stage\\nis we could provide another prompt\\nsuch as, please can you draft me the first installment\\nof the senior management monthly executive summary.\\n\\nAnd as you can see, it's broken it down.\\nIt's got a nice template for us.\\nWe've got an introduction, a project status overview.\\nThere is some dummy data in here\\nthat we would need to update.\\nGot an area for key achievements,\\nchallenges and mitigation strategies,\\nfinancial overview, next step and conclusion.\\nAnd then there's an area for the end of the report.\\nKeeping stakeholders updated with the progress of a project\\ncan be made simpler through AI

[Instructor] Building a project team is a crucial factor\\nin making projects successful,\\nit's a calculated process.\\nIt requires the identification, engagement,\\nand coordination of various individuals from the get-go,\\nensuring everyone is aligned\\nand motivated to towards your desired goal.\\nLet's now look at the fifth way AI\\ncan help streamline our work.\\nFirst up, identifying your project team.\\n\\nThis isn't just about roles and responsibilities,\\nit's about finding the right mix of skills, experience,\\nand personality to bring your project to life.\\nYou can use AI to not only map out the skills\\nand expertise required to achieve your project objectives,\\nbut to match them with potential team members.\\nIt can also help you identify\\na need for external recruitment.\\nSo I've opened up ChatGPT,\\nand I'm going to be showing you a series of prompts\\nthat we can use to identify our perfect project team.\\n\\nThe first is we could say something like,\\nI am the project manager of,\\nand then you can specify your project name.\\nThe aim of the project is,\\nhere, you would specify the main objective.\\nYou can provide additional context of the project.\\nSo, for instance,\\nand then you can specify something like this.\\n\\nPlease provide a list of essential skills\\nrequired for this project\\nand then hit submit.\\nSo here we are getting a series of different skills\\nthat we are going to need to leverage\\non this project for its success.\\nProject management, sales skills,\\nfinancial product knowledge,\\nclient relations, strategic thinking.\\nSo what we could then do is we could then\\nlook for individuals within our organization\\nwho fulfill such roles.\\n\\nNow, the other way of doing this,\\nand this works particularly well\\nif you have a skills matrix to hand\\nor an employee directory,\\nyou can input\\nthat into ChatGPT.\\nI'm now going to show you how.\\nFirstly, I'm going to show you the document.\\nSo here is the employee directory.\\nSo if you can prepare a document like this ahead of time,\\nyou will be in good stead.\\nBut essentially what we have here is a list\\nof different names, the title of the individual,\\nthe department they work within that email,\\nand then perhaps more importantly\\nfrom columns F to H are their key skills.\\n\\nSo if you don't have this available,\\nyou could ask your PMO if you have one,\\nor just reach out to HR.\\nSo I've headed back into ChatGPT.\\nNow this is what this particular prompt would look like.\\nIdentify the key skills\\nand expertise required\\nfor a project whereby we will be\\nonboarding clients onto our new financial product.\\nAgain, you'd need to update this accordingly.\\n\\nThe product is new to market.\\nNow here's the important part,\\nmatch these with profiles\\nfrom our internal database\\nor suggest criteria\\nfor external recruitment.\\nNow the latter is basically showing us if there's any gaps\\nwithin our skills of our teams.\\nSo we may need to look outside the organization for that.\\nSo at this point, I'm selecting this particular file,\\nwhich I just showed you.\\nWe'll see it now attached,\\nand now we're sending the message.\\n\\nSo what this prompt on the output is doing\\nis it's just outlining the key skills\\nand expertise that we need.\\nSo this is what it can be looking\\nfor within the document itself.\\nAnd now it's basically saying that it's going\\nto analyze the file.\\nYou'll notice this is a icon\\nwhen that is ongoing, it doesn't typically take too long.\\nNow here we go,\\nwe are being recommended some potential candidates\\nbased on our file.\\nSo it's suggesting Davis Lang, the product manager,\\nis a potential candidate for the product manager role.\\n\\nIt's also saying Tucker Quinn\\ncould be a good sales representative.\\nAinsley Barnett, a good customer service representative.\\nIt's also giving some suggestions for external recruitment\\non the basis that we could have potential skill gaps\\nin our organization.\\nNext, you need to engage your team.\\nOnce you've identified your team,\\nthe next step is engagement.\\nYou can begin with a kickoff meeting\\nto introduce the project,\\nits objectives and why each member was selected.\\nThis is your chance to inspire\\nand motivate highlighting the impact their work will have\\non the project's success.\\n\\nYou can use an AI tool like Claude\\nto map out your communications throughout this process.\\nI'm now going to show you how to do this.\\nSo I've opened up Claude and I've logged into my account\\nand I'm on the home interface.\\nNow I just need to craft the prompt\\nto help acquire the communication\\nwhile the kickoff meeting agenda.\\nSo draft an engaging kickoff meeting agenda for,\\nspecify your project name,\\nthat introduces the project goals.\\n\\nThis point you can open bracket\\nand essentially put in your goals, close bracket.\\nOutline why each member was chosen,\\nand emphasize the impact of their contributions.\\nNow, what you can do at this point,\\nis you can specify those stakeholders previously identified.\\nSo as an example,\\nyou could say something like the key team members are.\\n\\nSo I've just gone back to ChatGPT\\nto acquire the potential candidates.\\nI'm literally going to copy and paste this into Claude.\\nI've opened Claude, I've put a colon,\\nand I'm just pasting what I've copied previously.\\nand now I'm going to hit the submit button\\nSo here is a draft engaging kickoff meeting agenda\\nfor Project Alpha.\\nSo I could then copy\\nand paste this into our meeting platform of choice.\\n\\nIt could be something like Microsoft Outlook,\\nand I could set up a meeting accordingly.\\nIt could be Microsoft Teams.\\nNevertheless, it's given us the agenda,\\nand it's also put in some timestamps\\nas well for us to follow along.\\nIt's got an era for timeline and deliverables, next steps,\\nand even a team building activity on the end.\\nNow, we can provide further prompts to Claude to update this\\nif we wanted to, or we needed to make any changes.\\nIt's also essential to document responsibilities.\\nClarity is key in any project.\\n\\nClearly define each team member's responsibilities,\\ndeliverables, and deadlines.\\nYou can create artifacts like a RACI matrix to outline\\nwho is responsible, accountable, consulted,\\nand informed for each task.\\nSo what you can do at this point\\nis you can head back into ChatGPT,\\nwhich I'm now going to do.\\nSo I've now opened up the existing conversation\\nthat we had surrounding our essential skills.\\n\\nWhat we can do here is scroll to the bottom\\nand we can now say something like,\\ncreate a RACI matrix template for this project,\\ndetailing tasks and mapping out the responsibilities\\nacross the team.\\nNow note, because we've got this in here already,\\nChatGPT can leverage this existing conversation\\nand ensure that this is updated accordingly.\\n\\nSo here we go, and you'll notice\\nthat it's providing this in a tabular format,\\nwhich is very handy.\\nWe can copy and paste this into Microsoft Excel\\nor another platform that we are using.\\nIt is pre-formatted, which makes life a lot easier.\\nAnd you'll notice this is your typical RACI matrix.\\nIt's also provided a key so we can understand\\nwhat each letter stands for,\\nand it also gives us a little bit of context as\\nhow it pulled it all together.\\n\\nHere are some other tips and suggestions for this process.\\nFirst, foster a culture of collaboration\\nand open communication by encouraging team members\\nto share their ideas, concerns, and suggestions.\\nEnsure your team has the resources, tools,\\nand information needed to perform their tasks effectively.\\nLastly, encourage growth and development.\\nOffer opportunities for them to learn new skills,\\ntake on challenging tasks,\\nand grow professionally.\\n\\nSuccessfully establishing\\nand engaging your project team is pivotal\\nfor project success.\\nIntegrating AI into this process can revolutionize\\nhow you assemble, communicate with and support your team.\\nAI can assist in identifying the optimal mix\\nof skills needed for your project.\\nSuggest team members based on past performance\\nand expertise,\\nand even facilitate more effective communication.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

project documents\\ninto a seamless automated process, freeing your time\\nfor strategic thinking and other pressing activities.\\nIt's the sixth way we can leverage AI to streamline\\nour project management role.\\n\\nHere's why you need to do it.\\nFirstly, keeping project documentation up to date is crucial\\nfor the accuracy of project tracking, decision-making,\\nand communication.\\nSecondly, outdated documents can lead\\nto confusion, errors, and delays.\\nAnd thirdly, updated artifacts reflect the true state\\nof your project, facilitating smoother operations\\nand stakeholder confidence.\\nOnto the process.\\nIt all begins with creating a schedule and prioritization.\\n\\nYou can use AI to provide you with a simple,\\ndetailed breakdown of when you should update documents\\nor refer back to them.\\nI have now opened up ChatGPT to show you schedule\\nand prioritization in action.\\nSo here is a prompt that you can leverage.\\n\\\"I am a project manager running a project called,\\\"\\nI'm going to put Project Alpha, but again,\\nput in the name of your project here.\\n\\\"The intended goal is to onboard 25 clients\\n\\\"to our new

giving some direction as to exactly\\nwhere we currently are in the project,\\nand that will help ChatGPT understand\\nperhaps what documents we already have created.\\n\\\"Provide a detailed breakdown of when I need\\n\\\"to update existing documents\\n\\\"or refer back to them,\\\" and submit.\\n\\nSo, what it's doing now is it's just giving us\\nsome example documents that we need to take a look at.\\nSo for instance, the project charter,\\nthe project plan, and risk register,\\nclient lists,\\nanything that's changed the project's scope.\\nIt's also given us some ideas\\nas to how we should be adjusting these documents.\\nRegular status updates, so weekly or biweekly meetings,\\nclient updates,\\nand it's also broken down some effective use of documents\\nto manage this project.\\n\\nNow onto automating artifact updating and maintenance.\\nLeveraging the aforementioned and created schedule\\nand prioritization matrix.\\nYou first identify what template requires your attention.\\nThis could be updating status reporting,\\nrisk registers, or project plans.\\nYou essentially need to identify the templates\\nthat you want to update.\\nSo I've now loaded ChatGPT up,\\nand what I've got here is a project status report\\nthat I want to update.\\n\\nI'm going to be showing you an example prompt of\\nhow we can update this using ChatGPT.\\nSo I've just put it onto the screen\\njust so you can see it in action.\\nWe've got the project objective, the progress this week,\\nnew risks, outstanding items, next steps,\\nand yeah, we've got all those different sections.\\nSo at this point here is how you would leverage ChatGPT\\nto update this previous artifact.\\nSo \\\"here is a project status report I have created\\n\\\"for senior stakeholders.\\n\\n\\\"Provide the next installment.\\n\\\"Progress this week has been 'we have'\\\",\\nand then you could put this in quotation marks,\\n'we have signed five new clients for the next phase.\\n\\\"New risks identified are,\\\"\\nand then you can specify those.\\nSo for example, \\\"procurement challenges with hardware,\\n\\\"outstanding items remain surrounding client integration.\\\"\\nSo what I've essentially done here is I've just pulled out\\nvarious different elements of this particular\\nproject status report.\\n\\nSo I'm giving the tool direction to update each\\nand every section in the format we've already got.\\nAnd at this point, the tool is going to give us\\na couple of different responses in this case,\\nso we can choose which one we like the most.\\nNow, sometimes ChatGPT does this\\njust to give us the best output possible,\\nand it's essentially part of its learning algorithms.\\nSo I literally review both of these\\nand we're going to choose which one I prefer.\\nSo just having a quick review and glance at this.\\n\\nI like this one, so I'm going to select that\\nand essentially that has now been provided.\\nSo if we just have a quick look, it's provided the update.\\nSo now I can copy and paste this\\ninto the reporting mechanism of choice.\\nThis could be an email as an example.\\nAutomating project documentation\\nis not just a future possibility, it's a present day reality\\nthat can significantly impact\\nyour project management effectiveness.\\n\\nBy embracing AI, you can ensure\\nthat your project documentation is

effective communication.\\n\\nHere is the process that you can follow.\\nFirstly, identifying stakeholder requirements\\nand optimal delivery.\\nSo I've just opened Claude and logged into my account,\\nI'm now going into the chat interface.\\nSo here is a great prompt to start us out.\\nBased on this project overview and the listed stakeholders,\\nwhat we now need to do is open bracket,\\nand provide the context for this statement.\\n\\nSo, here, I'm going to say, \\\"Project to onboard 25 clients\\nto a new financial product.\\nInternal stakeholders\\ninclude senior management,\\nproduct team, and marketing team.\\nExternal stakeholders\\ninclude clients and investors, close bracket.\\\"\\nSo this is what you can update,\\ndepending on your particular project.\\n\\nNow, what I want to say is,\\n\\\"Create a tailored communication plan\\nthat identifies\\nthe most effective channels and frequencies\\nfor engaging each stakeholder group.\\\"\\nAnd that should do it.\\nAt that point, we need to hit this button here,\\nthe send message.\\n\\nSo, again, we just need to wait for Claude AI\\nto provide the output.\\nHere is a suggested communication plan\\nfor engaging in the different stakeholder groups.\\nSo in terms of our internal stakeholders,\\nit's recommending for senior management\\nthat we provide weekly status reports\\nand a monthly steering committee meeting.\\nAnd it's provided the frequency there.\\nAnd then it's also suggested the content that we include.\\nIt's done the same for product team as asked,\\nand the marketing team.\\n\\nIn terms of external stakeholders,\\nwe've got clients and investors.\\nNow, it's also added this little bit at the bottom,\\n\\\"The key goals of this plan are,\\\"\\nand then given us some tips as well.\\nYou can also use Claude\\nto draft personalized messages for stakeholders.\\nAt this point, we can return to our existing chat,\\nand we can provide a further prompt\\nto begin creating communications\\nfor certain such stakeholders.\\n\\nFor instance, we could say something like,\\n\\\"Generate a personalized email to senior management\\nabout the latest project milestones,\\ntailored to their interests and concerns.\\nThe latest project milestone that we have reached\\nis that we have successfully onboarded\\n10 out of 25 clients.\\\"\\nNow, of course, this bit is the element of the prompt\\nthat you would need to update according to your use case.\\n\\nAnd here you'll see\\nwe are getting that email created for us,\\nand it's even putting in some areas\\nwhere we can literally update it\\nto suit our particular needs.\\n\\\"I'm writing to provide the latest update\\non our strategic initiative\\nto launch our new placeholder for our product name\\noffering to 25 clients this quarter.\\nI'm pleased to share that as of,\\nwe have successfully onboarded 10 clients,\\nmarking a significant milestone in our project roadmap.\\\"\\nIt's got a key highlights area.\\nNow, what we can also do,\\nand it's also given us a sign off here,\\nwhat we can also do is we can return\\nto this particular chat area\\nand we can ask for some revisions.\\n\\nSo for instance, we could say\\nthat \\\"The project is due to complete\\nat the end of December, 2024.\\\"\\nYou know, \\\"Please update the email with this timeline.\\\"\\nThose are the kind of things that we can do.\\nClaude can also act as a first line of response\\nfor stakeholder queries.\\nBy feeding it project details and even FAQ documents,\\nClaude can autonomously provide stakeholders\\nwith immediate accurate answers to their questions,\\nfreeing up your time to focus on more complex issues.\\n\\nHere is an example of this in action.\\nSo I have returned to Claude.\\nAt this stage, you could set up a new chat\\nor you could work from your existing chat.\\nBoth of them will work.\\nBear in mind, if you operate from an existing chat,\\nit will leverage the history\\nof what's already come before it.\\nSo, here is the prompt I recommend you use.\\n\\\"Help me curate a list of FAQs\\nfor me to pull together for the project,\\nsuch as when is the project planned to end\\nfor internal stakeholders?\\\"\\nNow, you can update various elements of this.\\n\\nIt could be, you could change this example\\nand you could change this too,\\nfor external stakeholders, for example.\\nWe're going to hit go.\\nSo, here are the suggested questions that we capture.\\nNow, what we could always do at this point,\\nit's given us four round project timeline.\\nIt's given us a further four about client onboarding.\\nIt's given us a couple on resource and budget FAQs,\\nand some with some cross-functional considerations,\\nand even post-launch planning.\\nSo there's 17 questions here.\\n\\nAll of these are really, really effective\\nand which we could answer.\\nThey just give us some ideas.\\nWe could even ask the tool to draft answers\\nfor these questions as well.\\nThe next step is that we can use Claude AI\\nfor feedback collection and analysis.\\nSo headed back into Claude\\nfor us to basically create a survey.\\nSo what we can do here, this is an example prompt,\\n\\\"Design a stakeholder feedback survey\\nthat measures satisfaction with the project's progress,\\nand gathers input on areas for improvement.\\\"\\nAt this point, we are getting that feedback survey.\\n\\nWe can copy and paste this into our tool that we are using,\\nwhether that's a project management software\\nor even if it's the Microsoft Office Suite, as an example.\\nAnd what it's done here is it's given us different options.\\nSo we've got Disagree, Neutral, Agree, and Strongly Agree.\\nSo this would be really, really good\\nin terms of essentially being able to score\\nall of the different answers,\\nand basically collate a lot of different answers together\\ninto actionable insights.\\nIt also gives us some

[Instructor] Up to this point, I've walked you through\\ninitiating, planning, and executing\\non your projects using AI.\\nBut without a clear understanding\\nof your project's finances,\\ndistinguishing success from failure becomes guesswork.\\nYou can use AI to master your project's financials.\\nHere is the ninth way to implement AI\\nto streamline your workflow.\\nBut why use ChatGPT?\\nWell, ChatGPT stands out when working with data sets\\ndue to its ability to process\\nand interpret large volumes of data efficiently.\\n\\nIts proficiency in natural language understanding\\nallows you to query your data in conversational language,\\nmaking complex data analysis accessible and insightful.\\nHere is the process for analyzing cost\\nand budget data sets with ChatGPT.\\nFirst, you need to prepare your dataset.\\nEnsure your cost and budget data is clean and structured.\\nThis will involve compiling data into a single spreadsheet,\\nwith clear labels for each column,\\nsuch as date, cost type, amount, et cetera.\\n\\nNext, you need to upload your data set.\\nYou can do this directly in ChatGPT\\nusing the paperclip icon\\nto the left of the message dialogue box,\\nand I'll be showing you how to do this shortly.\\nLastly, set clear analysis objectives.\\nDefine what you want to learn from your data analysis.\\nFor example, do you want to identify areas of overspending,\\nor do you want to compare projected costs\\nagainst actual expenses, et cetera?\\nNote, be mindful of any sensitive data\\nyou enter into AI tools.\\n\\nYou may require business sign off,\\nand may need to refer to internal compliance policies\\nahead of time.\\nWhen working with an AI tool like ChatGPT\\nto interpret and summarize project costs and budget data,\\ncrafting the right prompts is crucial\\nfor extracting meaningful insights.\\nAccessing the handout pertaining to this video\\nlocated in the exercise files folder will help direct you\\nto a series of prompts that you can use.\\nFor instance, you can interpret data\\nto identify trends and anomalies,\\ncompare budgeted to actual expenses,\\nassess cost efficiency,\\nand even evaluate a project's overall financial health.\\n\\nI've now opened ChatGPT to show you\\nhow we can run some of this analysis.\\nSo here is the prompt that I suggest that you use.\\nOf course, you can adapt this to suit your needs,\\nbut this is the process in action.\\n\\\"What are the trends in monthly spending\\nover the last 12 months?\\\"\\nNow, what we're going to want to do at this point\\nis we're going to want to click\\nthis paperclip icon to the left,\\nand then you need to find the file\\nthat is saved on your local hard drive.\\n\\nSo this is the file that we're going to be using.\\nPress Open, and at this point you'll see\\nthat it has been successfully attached.\\nIf you did choose the wrong one,\\nyou can always press this little X, remove file,\\nand just select the right one\\ngoing through that process again.\\nNow, before I hit Submit, I just want to show you\\nwhat the underlying file looks like just for your reference,\\nand if you wanted to replicate a similar file.\\nSo this has been pre-formatted\\nso that ChatGPT can successfully analyze and read it.\\n\\nSo here we've basically got our revenue\\nand our operating expenses.\\nSo what I've done is I've put\\nall of this information at the top.\\nSo all of these kind of, you know, the bottom bits here,\\nso this logo and this information is just, you know,\\nnot interrupting the file being read.\\nWe've also got columns for each and every month,\\nand this has been hard coded,\\nso there's no formulas in here, okay?\\nIt's all once it's been summarized,\\nit's hardcoded and ready for upload.\\n\\nSo back into ChatGPT, we are now ready to hit Send message.\\nAnd you'll notice this little icon, and it says Analyzing.\\nThis is how we know that ChatGPT is reading the file\\nthat we have uploaded.\\nNow, it doesn't actually take that long\\nas you shall soon see,\\nand what will happen first and foremost\\nis the tool will relay essentially\\nif it's been able to access that file,\\nand what it's been able to obtain from it.\\nSo, \\\"The Excel file contains one sheet\\nwith financial data spanning several categories\\nover the last 12 months.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of the categories presented in the data.\\\"\\nNow, as we can see, it's provided us\\nwith some initial analysis.\\nIt's given us a graph that we could leverage\\nif we wanted to, which is really, really useful.\\nNote that on the left-hand side that these expenses,\\nit does look a little bit off,\\nbut we could use this, we may want to add our own access,\\nbut we could use this and it just gives us an idea,\\nvisually we can kind of see what's happening\\nwith our monthly operating expenses,\\nso we can take that further as well.\\n\\\"The chart above displays the trend\\nin monthly operating expenses.\\n\\nHere's what we can observe.\\\"\\nSo here's the important parts.\\n\\\"Steady increase, there is a gradual increase\\nin operating expenses throughout the year.\\nEnd of year rise.\\nThe expenses peak towards the end of the year,\\nnotably in December,\\npossibly due to year-end financial activities\\nor increased operational needs.\\\"\\nSo that's really interesting to think about.\\nNow, if you did want to see the analysis,\\nthis little icon will appear,\\nand it basically just shows you\\nwhat's kind of happened here.\\nIt's beyond the scope of this course,\\nbut if you did want to see what analysis has been done\\nfrom a Python perspective,\\nthen you can do so via that button.\\n\\nThat's what essentially that is.\\nOnce you have interpreted your data,\\nyou can then look to report on it.\\nBe sure to also refer to the handout\\npertaining to this video.\\nThis will provide you with a series of prompts\\nthat you can use.\\nSo I'm now going to show you another prompt\\nthat we can leverage to get some documentation\\noff the back of this initial analysis.\\nSo I've gone back into ChatGPT\\nand loaded up the initial analysis chat that we had\\nbased on that spreadsheet we formally attached\\nand via that initial prompt.\\n\\nSo the second prompt that I would suggest\\nthat you leverage is,\\n\\\"Provide an overview of the project's financial health,\\nincluding any potential risks or opportunities\\nidentified in the data analysis.\\\"\\nWhat we're trying to do here via this prompt\\nis just draw out some further information,\\nkind of like this, but we want a little bit more detail,\\nand this kind of prompt can help us get there.\\n\\nSo what this is doing, as we can see here,\\nso it's kind of discussed the consistent growth\\nthat's already been kind of provided,\\nbut this is where it gets really interesting.\\nCost of goods sold.\\nSo it's now looking at individual line items,\\nand that's where this particular prompt\\ncan come into its own.\\nSo we've got moderate increase in the cost of goods sold.\\nWe've got some stable profit margins,\\na gradual increase in operating expenses.\\nPotential risks, so there's rising expenses, year-end surge.\\nAnd here are some opportunities for revenue growth\\nand cost efficiency.\\n\\nAnd then at the conclusion,\\nit usually gives us a high level overview\\nof just some of the key analysis.\\n\\\"The project appears financially healthy\\nwith solid revenue growth and controlled cost increases.\\nHowever, it is crucial to maintain vigilance\\nover the increasing operating expenses\\nand the end-of-year expense surge to ensure\\nthat they do not undermine the financial stability.\\\"\\nNow, what you can do at this stage\\nis you could say something like,\\n\\\"Based on the above analysis, provide a short email\\nto report on the findings to senior management.\\\"\\nSo at this point, we can essentially\\nstart to use this analysis to yeah,\\nnotify different stakeholders in the organization.\\n\\nI've put senior management here,\\nbut you could do that to any stakeholder that you wanted to.\\nNow, what we've got here is two different responses.\\nSometimes ChatGPT will do this.\\nWhat this is basically asking us,\\nis this is actually helping to train ChatGPT.\\nSo it's not really for our own purposes,\\nbut it is good to know\\nbecause we can basically choose what we prefer,\\nso it is sometimes useful.\\nSo essentially we just need to read through both of these\\nand just see which one we prefer.\\nSo just having a look at this particular,\\na very kind of quick glance,\\nI'm just going to go response one,\\nthat seemed to be a little bit more concise.\\n\\nBut now we have this email\\nthat we can then send to senior stakeholders\\njust to report on that former analysis.\\nUsing these prompts, you can guide the AI\\nto help you delve into your project's financial data,\\ninterpret the nuances within,\\nand summarize the insights in a structured report\\nor within communications.\\nThis process not only aids in understanding\\nwhere your project stands financially,\\nbut also in making informed decisions moving forward.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5925675\",\"duration\":706,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Monitor scope creep with

[Instructor] Scope creep can derail\\neven the most well-planned projects,\\nleading to budget overruns, delayed timelines,\\nand stressed teams.\\nFortunately, AI tools offer powerful solutions\\nto monitor and prevent these risks.\\nHere is the 10th way AI can be effectively used\\nfor streamlining project management activities.\\nBut before we delve in,\\nmore on scope creep and why you need to be mindful of it.\\n\\nScope creep occurs when a project scope\\nexpands beyond its initial parameters.\\nOften, without proper approvals.\\nIt can sneak up silently,\\nmaking it a formidable challenge for project managers.\\nHere's how to use AI to prevent scope creep.\\nYou can access the handout created for this video\\nin the Exercise Files folder\\nfor suggested prompts to use here.\\nI will be walking you through an example\\nof how you can implement this process.\\n\\nStep one, set up project parameters in ChatGPT.\\nYou first need to define your project scope clearly.\\nYou want to input detailed information\\nabout your project's objectives, deliverables, deadlines,\\nand budget into ChatGPT.\\nFrom there, you can create a baseline document\\nthat outlines these parameters,\\nwhich you can then refer back to\\nthroughout the course of the project.\\nSo I have now loaded ChatGPT\\nto show you this baseline document creation process\\nin action.\\n\\nHere is the recommended prompt I suggest that you use.\\n\\\"The scope of our project is to onboard 25 clients\\nonto our new financial product.\\\"\\nSo here, you want to clearly state\\nexactly what the scope of your project is,\\nprovide as much detail as you possibly can.\\n\\\"We aim to deliver by the end of Q4 2024.\\\"\\nSo now's a good time to tell ChatGPT\\nwhat your deadline for the project is.\\n\\n\\\"The total budget is,\\\"\\nand then again, you need to specify the amount.\\n\\\"Based on this,\\ncan you provide a detailed baseline document\\nthat we can reference and monitor project progress\\nand any changes going forward?\\\"\\nNow we hit the Send message button.\\nAnd now we just need to wait for ChatGPT\\nto create this baseline document.\\n\\nSo it begins by giving an overview\\nof the core elements of the project,\\nand then it's broken down the various elements.\\nSo we have Project Objectives, Key Deliverables,\\nthere's a section on Budget Allocation.\\nNow what this will do is it will create sections\\nthat will probably have kind of dummy data inserted.\\nSo as an example, Development Costs.\\nWe didn't specify these to ChatGPT.\\nSo what we would need to do\\nis we would need to update these.\\nIf we were to copy and paste this into another document,\\nwe would need to update them there.\\n\\nOr alternatively,\\nwe could provide another prompt at the bottom here,\\nsaying something like,\\n\\\"Our development costs were $80,000,\\\" as an example.\\nCan you update the baseline document accordingly?\\nSo what you could do\\nis you could go and collect all of this information,\\nif you wanted to,\\nor you could ask ChatGPT to, say,\\nremove project management and admin cost\\nas an example in the Budget section.\\nGot an area for Timeline and Milestones.\\nWe've got a chart here,\\nso it's even breaking all of this down for us.\\nGot a whole area in Risk Management.\\n\\nAs you can see, this is a comprehensive document\\nthat we are going to be able to leverage going forward.\\nYou've got all of the key areas.\\nIf you did want another section or a section removed,\\nyou can provide that as a prompt.\\nSo as an example, \\\"Remove the Risk Management section.\\nReplace with a,\\\" as an example.\\nYou could provide a prompt like that.\\nStep two, regular monitoring with AI.\\nAt this point,\\nyou can schedule regular check-ins with ChatGPT\\nto review your project's progress.\\n\\nDuring these sessions,\\nyou can input the latest project updates\\nand ask ChatGPT to compare them\\nagainst your baseline document.\\nAgain, I'd recommend accessing the handout\\nthat has been created for this video\\nin the Exercise Files folder\\nfor suggested prompts to use here.\\nThat being said,\\nI am going to show you an example in ChatGPT now.\\nSo I've headed back into ChatGPT.\\nI'm going to remove this further follow-up prompt.\\n\\nWe're not going to be using it at this time,\\nbut here is a prompt that we can use for step two,\\nfor the regular monitoring part of the process.\\nSo what we could do as an example is,\\n\\\"Our latest status report\\nindicated we have onboarded 10 clients\\nat a cost of $75,000.\\\"\\nAgain, this is just an example.\\nCompare this latest project update\\nwith the initial baseline document provided above.\\n\\nBe really specific to ChatGPT here.\\nIs anything worth noting or investigating?\\nSo here what we're essentially looking for ChatGPT to do\\nis take our kind of recent information\\nand just compare it against the old\\nand just draw attention to kind of anything\\nthat we may need to be mindful of.\\nSo it's more of an analysis process.\\nSo again, at the top, what it's doing here,\\nit's just confirming it understands our request.\\n\\nSo here, we're getting some analysis.\\nSo the project is 40% complete\\nin terms of client onboarding,\\n75% of the budget has been used\\nto onboard just 40% of the clients.\\nSo this is the kind of key takeaway.\\nThis is what we were kind of looking for.\\nKey Areas for Investigation, Budget Consumption,\\nthe high expenditure\\nrelative to the number of clients onboarded\\ncould indicate inefficiencies or unexpected costs,\\nCost per Client.\\nSo it's just given us all of this kind of information\\nand then it's given us recommendations.\\nThis is the really important point.\\nSo we may need to review and adjust our budget,\\nwe may need to implement cost reduction strategies,\\nwe may need to step up our monitoring,\\nwe may need to change how we onboard our clients,\\nand we may need to communicate this all with stakeholders,\\nwhich is really, really important.\\n\\nSo this analysis just gives us direction\\nof where we go from here.\\nSo this is where it's really, really useful.\\nStep three, analyzing AI output.\\nSo at this point,\\nwe do need to review the insights provided by ChatGPT,\\nand as previously discussed.\\nYou want to look for any flagged deviations\\nfrom the original scope\\nor any new tasks that could contribute to scope creep.\\nWe can use ChatGPT to brainstorm solutions\\nor adjustments for any identified risks of scope expansion.\\n\\nSo I've just headed back into ChatGPT,\\njust to show you that this is,\\nessentially, this process in action.\\nSo if we weren't provided\\nwith these recommendations upfront,\\nwe could ask ChatGPT for them at this particular stage.\\nOr alternatively, if we don't like the output,\\nso say we got these five recommendations,\\nwe could ask for an update.\\nSo we could say something like,\\n\\\"Please revise the recommendations.\\\"\\nOr alternatively, you could say something like,\\n\\\"New information has come to light.\\nThe last 15 clients should only cost 25,000 to onboard.\\n\\nWith this in mind,\\nplease revise the recommendations.\\\"\\nThat's a prompt that you could do at this particular point.\\nWhat I'm just trying to show you\\nis how you can direct ChatGPT\\nin whatever direction you need to go\\nand based on what is actually happening on the ground.\\nSo here, it's suggesting that we validate\\nthese cost projections because it does seem almost strange\\nthat 10 clients cost us 75,000 out of a budget of 100,000,\\nbut then the remaining 15 are costing 25,000.\\n\\nSo here we go.\\nIt's saying that we need to consult,\\nwe need to verify, we need to monitor our spending,\\nimprove efficiency, and then communicate.\\nSo in this instance, it kind of makes sense\\nthat some of these recommendations are relatively similar,\\nbut you get the idea and the process here.\\nThis is how we just need to use ChatGPT accordingly.\\nStep four, we need to implement our measures\\nthat have been recommended to us.\\nSo you want to communicate your findings\\nand concerns with your team and stakeholders.\\nWe can also use ChatGPT to draft these clear communications\\nregarding the potential scope creep and its implications.\\n\\nYou can also adjust project plans\\nand documentation as necessary based on the AI's analysis.\\nJust ensure that all changes are approved\\naccording to your project's governance structure.\\nSo I've gone back into ChatGPT and our existing chat\\nthat we've been leveraging\\nthroughout the monitor scope process,\\nand I'm just going to be showing you now\\nwhat you could do to create some communication.\\nSo you could literally say something like,\\n\\\"Generate a message to stakeholders\\nexplaining potential scope creep\\nand its impact on the project.\\\"\\nNow, if you want to be more specific,\\nyou could say, \\\"To the stakeholders,\\\"\\nand then you could do something like,\\n\\\"Senior management - internal reporting.\\\"\\nYou could even say something like, \\\"Create this as a email.\\n\\nCreate this in the format of an email.\\\"\\nBut you could also change this to be something like,\\n\\\"Create a meeting agenda\\nfor a discussion with the senior management.\\\"\\nDo you get the idea?\\nYou just want to adapt this to suit your needs.\\nSo hit this now.\\nIf we just read this, it actually looks fantastic\\njust from kind of initial inspection.\\nIt's really, really personal.\\nI'm writing to bring your attention\\nto a critical issue that's emerged.\\nAs you're aware,\\nour initial budget for the project was 100,000.\\n\\nHowever, recent developments have prompted\\na reassessment of our current trajectory\\nand financial commitment,\\nspecifically the cost incurred to onboard the first.\\nSo, yeah, this is really, really good.\\nLook, we've got sections on the scope creep,\\nsuggestions moving forward,\\nand it's also signed off as well.\\nSo this is really, really good.\\nObviously, we'll require a little bit of updating\\non your side,\\nbut it gives you a really, really good base email\\nto work from.\\nAt this point, this may be okay for you,\\nbut you could say, \\\"The overall sentiment is great.\\nHowever, rewrite in half the words,\\\" just as an example.\\n\\nIf this is too long,\\nthen you may want it a little bit shorter.\\nSo you can do little things like that.\\nDon't be afraid to ask it to rewrite.\\nBe more specific if it's not covering\\nexactly what you want the first time around.\\nBy leveraging the AI tools like ChatGPT to monitor\\nand analyze your project's adherence to its defined scope,\\nyou can proactively identify\\nand mitigate risks of scope creep.\\nThis ensures your project remains on track, within budget,\\nand aligned with its original goals.\\nIn the next video,\\nwe turn to obtaining project delivery acceptance\\nand how AI can help aid us can this important milestone.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5930007\",\"duration\":686,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Automate project deliverable

ChatGPT can automate this crucial process, saving time\\nand enhancing efficiency for both internal\\nand external stakeholders.\\nHere is the 11th way to use AI\\nto streamline your project lifecycle.\\n\\nBut first, understanding deliverable acceptance.\\nDeliverable acceptance involves obtaining formal approval\\non completed project outputs.\\nIt's essential for progressing\\nto subsequent phases or concluding projects.\\nThe challenge, this process can be manual, time consuming\\nand prone to delays.\\nHere's how to use AI to obtain deliverable acceptance.\\nStep 1: Prepare your acceptance criteria and templates.\\n\\nYou first need to outline your clear acceptance criteria\\nfor each deliverable.\\nThese criteria should define what success looks like\\nand what must be achieved for acceptance to be granted.\\nYou can use ChatGPT to draft your acceptance templates.\\nYou need to input your acceptance criteria\\nand ask it to create a standardized template\\nfor deliverable acceptance.\\nThis template should include sections\\nfor deliverable details, acceptance criteria,\\nstakeholder feedback, and approval signatures.\\n\\nI'm now going to show you this in action in ChatGPT.\\nSo I've loaded up ChatGPT and a new chat,\\nand I'm now going to be showing you the prompt\\nthat you can use for this process.\\nCreate a deliverable acceptance template that we can use.\\nIt must include the following,\\nand we're actually going to change this use for our project.\\nIt must include the following, deliverable details,\\nacceptance criteria, stakeholder feedback,\\nand approval signatures.\\n\\nThe project is called 'project alpha.\\nThat should have been a apostrophe.\\nAnd the deliverable is onboarding access\\nto our new financial product.\\nSo as you can see here, a lot\\nof this you can leverage right off the bat.\\nYou will need to make a few changes.\\nFor instance, this last sentence you'll need\\nto update for your own projects.\\nHere's a deliverable acceptance template tailored\\nfor Project Alpha, here we go.\\n\\nNow bear in mind, because this is a template, you will need\\nto enter this information yourself pertaining\\nto your particular project.\\nSo it does depend on\\nwhere you are going to be using this template.\\nFor instance, if it's Microsoft Word,\\nit could be Excel as well.\\nYou just need to be mindful of your formatting.\\nSo here is the acceptance criteria.\\nIt needs to have some functional requirements,\\nsome performance requirements, usability requirements.\\nSo this gives us a general idea of what we need to include.\\nAt this point, we could go back\\nin the chat, we could provide another prompt.\\n\\nFor instance here it says, the system should handle up\\nto simultaneous users without performance degradation.\\nSo let's just say we know\\nthat say 50,000 users are going to be using our platform.\\nOnce all clients are onboarded,\\nwe would then essentially input that information here.\\nWe could provide this as a prompt.\\nPlease update the performance requirements to include,\\nand then you could put 50,000 users simultaneously, 1%.\\nSo let me show you this action.\\nUpdate the template to include the following\\nperformance requirements: 50,000 users at a time,\\nmust handle, and then you could say something\\nlike downtime of 1%.\\n\\nAs an example, that's what you could do here.\\nThere's also an area for stakeholder feedback,\\nand there here will be a summary of the feedback received\\nfrom stakeholders during the review period,\\nmodifications made.\\nAnd then we've got an approval for project manager,\\nlead developer, quality assurance lead and key stakeholders.\\nAnd then it's also given us an instructions for use.\\nSo each section of this template should be filled out upon\\nnearing the completion of the deliverable.\\nThe deliverable should be reviewed\\nagainst the list acceptance criteria\\nto ensure all conditions are met.\\nBefore final approval, gather and incorporate feedback\\nfrom all relevant stakeholders to enhance the deliverable.\\n\\nAnd I'll be walking you through that in a second.\\nAnd then there's an area for signature collection.\\nSo this template will streamline your process for verifying\\nthat deliverables meet the predefined standards\\nand expectations, ensuring smooth\\nand structured project execution.\\nStep 2: Automating Deliverable Acceptance.\\nAt this point, and if possible, you could look\\nto build an automated submission process using your\\nproject management software.\\nSo it could be a form that your clients populate\\nor it could just be some means of collecting their feedback.\\nNow this process should allow for the automatic sending\\nof deliverables to relevant stakeholders\\nalongside the acceptance template.\\n\\nSo they basically want to see exactly\\nwhat they will be hopefully signing off on\\nand accepting the project is deliverable.\\nIf you can also set up notifications for the submission\\nand reminders for stakeholders to review\\nand respond, that will be really beneficial as well.\\nWhat you can then do is you can head over to ChatGPT\\nto help with this process.\\nSo I've gone back into ChatGPT.\\nWhat we could look to do here is I want to collect feedback\\nfrom the clients who are being onboarded.\\n\\nProvide a templated form to collect this feedback.\\nReally specific.

Overall satisfaction.\\n\\nIt just gives us a really, really good base template\\nto start collecting feedback.\\nAnd again, we've got an instruction for use,\\nwhich is really, really handy.\\nTalking about distribution,\\nhow we can collect this information, how we analyze it,\\nand the actions that we need to take.\\nStep 3: we need to streamline our feedback and revisions.\\nSo once we start receiving feedback,\\nwe can then use ChatGPT to summarize comments\\nand even obtain some suggestions\\nfor what we should do based on that feedback.\\nAnd this can significantly speed up the iteration process.\\n\\nSo I've headed back into ChatGPT based\\non our existing chat where we use both prompts.\\nSo as an example,\\nbased on the deliverable acceptance template,\\nand then also asking for the feedback form.\\nWhat we can do at this point,\\nwe've got a couple of different things.\\nIf we've got documents that include, you know,\\nlet's just say, you use this particular form,\\nyou send this to a client and they populated it\\nand sent it back, you could then look to attach it\\nand then ask ChatGPT to summarize it or even analyze it\\nand provide the suggestions going forward.\\n\\nBut you could also type it in manually to ChatGPT.\\nSo I'm just going to show you that process\\nbecause that's very, very useful.\\nSo as an example, we have received\\nthe following feedback from clients.\\nThe onboarding process was smooth\\nand we had all hardware in place in under three hours.\\nSo this particular process,\\nthis prompt is really good if you get a lot\\nof kind of feedback and text format rather than a checkbox.\\n\\nHowever, there was a two hour delay due\\nto software installation,\\nwhich gave us a two hour period of downtime.\\nSo what you could do here, this is say one piece\\nof feedback, what you could do is do something\\nlike this, another client provided;\\nand then you could put that comment in here.\\nSo you could say something like, the product kept rebooting\\nafter installation, just as an example.\\n\\nI'm going for a really quick one there just\\nto show you the process.\\nSo you could basically keep listing what clients are saying.\\nYou can copy and paste it into ChatGPT\\nif that saves you time as well.\\nNow here's the important part of the prompt.\\nBased on this feedback, what changes are recommended\\nto meet the acceptance criteria?\\nSo if you remember up above,\\nlet me just quickly scroll there\\nbefore I submit this prompt, we have, where is it?\\nThere's a particular, here we go.\\nThe onboarding process should have a downtime\\nof less than something percent outside\\nof scheduled maintenance.\\n\\nLittle things like that.\\nSo what this is doing is it's going back to\\nthat acceptance criteria and running that comparison.\\nI'm just going to let this run\\nand then we can kind of discuss what we're getting back.\\nSo here we go. Here's an example.\\nWe may want to have some pre-installation checks.\\nWe may want to alter the client experience.\\nSo it's just giving us some areas to look into here.\\nIt's really, really useful for that.\\nAnd it's even given us an implementation strategy as well.\\nThere's an element on feedback loop.\\nSo there's a lot to look into here.\\n\\nThat's what I really, really like about these prompts.\\nIt helps us think strategically\\nand it just gives us some direction\\nof where we take it from here.\\nStep 4: Finalize acceptance and documentation.\\nSo at this part of the process, you need to work closely\\nwith your clients on the feedback that they've provided\\nand ensure that they are satisfied with the deliverable.\\nOnce all criteria are met\\nand stakeholders have indicated their approval,\\nyou can then move the project into a completed status\\nand also archive the acceptance documentation.\\n\\nYou do want to maintain a digital record\\nof all communications, feedback and approvals\\nfor compliance and also future reference.\\nBy leveraging AI\\nto automate the deliverable acceptance process,\\nyou can streamline communication,\\nreduce administrative burden,\\nand ensure a faster transition to project closure.\\nIn the final chapter of the course,\\nwe'll be taking a look at how we can leverage the outcomes\\nof our project to drive innovation, inspiration,\\nand success for all future projects we ever pursue.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"5.

[Instructor] In this final chapter,\\nyou will learn how to use AI to allow\\nfor continued project success.\\nIn any project measuring success against initial objectives\\nis crucial for understanding performance,\\nlearning from experiences and improving future projects.\\nIt's the 12th way to implement AI on your projects.\\nAI tools, especially ChatGPT,\\ncan be instrumental in analyzing\\nproject outcomes versus objectives,\\noffering a streamlined, insightful approach\\nto evaluating project success.\\n\\nI'm now going to show you this process in action.\\nSo step one, define your project objectives and outcomes.\\nBegin by retrieving your project's objectives from initial\\ndocumentation that you created in the initiation phase.\\nOnce a project completes, compile data on what was achieved,\\nincluding metrics, deliverables,\\nand any other outcome indicators.\\n\\nNext, you want to allow for the documentation\\nof these project outcomes.\\nSo I have now loaded up ChatGPT,\\nand I've navigated back to one of the chats that we created\\nduring the initiation phase.\\nSo what I was looking for here\\nwere the objectives of the project.\\nNow these were the SMART objectives\\nthat we initially created.\\nSo what's really helpful here is if you rename your chat\\nso that you can find them in the future.\\n\\nYou may even want to create a document\\nthat references the exact name of each process\\nso that you can refer back to 'em in the future.\\nNow, if you click on these more dots,\\nyou can rename the chat from here.\\nSo we could put something\\nlike Initiation Phase SMART Objectives.\\nSo that's just a little tip for you.\\nNow what we want to do is we now want to set up the ability\\nto evaluate our project outcomes against these objectives.\\nSo what we can do here,\\nwhat we actually had done in this chat\\nis we had created these initial objectives\\nand then we moved on to creating detailed tasks.\\n\\nBut what you can actually do,\\nbut bear in mind, this does remove the rest of the output.\\nSo what I'm about to show you, you know,\\nunless you've taken this and copied and pasted it elsewhere,\\nit's going to kind of be removed going forward.\\nBut what we can do is we can jump back\\ninto a previous message that we put in\\nand kind of ask for a slightly different outcome.\\nSo as an example, we don't want the detailed task anymore.\\nWe are now in the process of evaluating project outcomes.\\nSo what I'm going to say at this point is,\\nso I've double clicked on this and I'm wiping that out.\\n\\nWhat we will now want to say is, \\\"Create a template\\nfor evaluating project outcomes\\nagainst each objective above.\\\"\\nSo I'm going to hit save and submit,\\nand you'll notice it's removed that rest of that chat,\\nbut it is now building out from this kind of the history\\nand the message that was sent before it.\\nSo generate a list of SMART objectives.\\nSo here we go.\\n\\nSo it's giving us a description, the criteria for success,\\nthe data collection methods, and how we can evaluate,\\nand any action points that we need to undertake.\\nSo let's let this finish.\\nI'm actually going to close this sidebar\\nto give us some more space here.\\nSo it's doing it for every single objective\\nthat we set up at the start of the project.\\nThis template provides a clear\\nand structured way to measure progress and outcomes,\\nensuring that all efforts are aligned\\nwith the strategic goals of the project.\\n\\nEach section allows for both quantitative\\nand qualitative analysis,\\nfacilitating comprehensive project reviews and adjustments.\\nSo as you can see here, this is just making sure\\nthat everything that we did\\nor that we wanted to do at the start of the project,\\nwe are essentially making sure that we cover that.\\nStep two, preparing your data for analysis.\\nYou need to ensure that all relevant data\\non project outcomes is collected and organized.\\nThis might include project reports, performance metrics,\\nstakeholder feedback, or even financial documents.\\n\\nYou then need to convert this data into a format\\nthat can be easily processed by ChatGPT,\\nsuch as a summary document\\nor a structured list of key points.\\nSo I've gone back into ChatGPT\\nand the previous chats that we were working from.\\nWhat we now want to do is put in a prompt like this.\\n\\\"Here is an overview of our project outcomes,\\\" colon.\\nNow at this point, you can literally list them.\\nYou can copy and paste them.\\n\\nAs I say, this may be from various different templates.\\nSo this can take up a lot of space,\\nand you can be putting a lot of information in here.\\nBut just for the purpose of the demo and illustration,\\nI'm just going to put in some example text here\\nfor the kind of information that you want to put in.\\nSo, we completed the onboarding process\\ntwo months before schedule.\\nI'm going to say, end of Q4, 2024 was the deadline,\\nbut we were over budget by, I'm going to put 55,000.\\n\\nAgain, just an example.\\nAll clients migrated to the new product.\\nFeedback has been mixed.\\nThe summary of the feedback was, and again,\\nyou could literally type that in here.\\nYou could put it in quotation marks if you wanted to.\\nAnd I'm just going to say something like\\nlots of product downtime.\\nCreate a structured, and here's the important part.\\nSo this is where you need\\nto input the specifics for your project.\\n\\nThis is almost what you need to put in at the start.\\nAnd then this is very, very essential at the end.\\nAnd put a full stop in here.\\nCreate a structured bulleted list of key points.\\nNow, this is particularly useful with the more information\\nthat you are providing in here.\\nAs you can see, this isn't the largest prompt,\\nso it's going to be quite hard for it to create a list\\nof bullet points based on this information,\\nbut it's going to give it a go anyway.\\nWe've got a timeline achievement,\\nwe've got budget management,\\nclient onboarding, and client feedback.\\n\\nSo it's just broken it down into a nice template.\\nAnd it's also comparing it back\\nto those initial SMART objectives,\\nwhich is really, really important here.\\nStep three, using ChatGPT for analysis.\\nSo at this particular point, we need to ask the tool\\nto essentially run that comparison.\\nSo we're looking for the project objectives\\nand outcomes here,\\nand we're asking for a comparison of the two.\\nWe're focusing on areas of success\\nand where there were deviations from the plan.\\n\\nSo again, loaded up ChatGPT,\\nand we're continuing on from the existing\\nchat of where we've left it.\\nWe are looking for the structured\\nbulleted list of key points.\\nSo at this point, what you can say is something like this,\\n\\\"Compare the initial SMART objectives,\\\"\\nwhich is the first element of the chat.\\nIf I scroll up to the top.\\nDo you remember these at the start\\nthat we did during initiation?\\nSo \\\"compare the initial SMART objectives\\nwith the resulting project outcomes,\\nfocus on areas of success\\nand where there were deviations from the plan.\\\"\\nThen we're going to hit send.\\n\\nHere is where we are getting that analysis.\\nWe're looking at successes, we're looking at deviations,\\nand it's doing it on an objective by objective basis,\\nwhich is fantastic as well.\\nNow what we could also say is something like,\\nprovide a further prompt, something like,\\n\\\"Provide a high level summary of success deviation.\\\"\\nSo as you can see here, we're getting this kind of\\nreally, really granular overview of what happened\\nfor each element of the project on the SMART objectives.\\n\\nBut if you did want something kind of more high level,\\nthen you could do this as well.\\nNow, this is really, really useful\\nwhen it comes to reporting.\\nAnd we've got a conclusion here.\\nWhile the project successfully met its timeline\\nand client onboarding goals, it faced challenges\\nin budget management and product stability,\\nwhich impacted client satisfaction.\\nThese areas represent key opportunities\\nfor improvement in future projects, emphasizing the need\\nfor better cost control and product quality assurance.\\nSo some really, really good insights here for us to take on.\\nStep four, we can also deep dive into specific areas.\\n\\nSo we can leverage ChatGPT\\nto conduct even more detailed analysis\\nof specific areas of interest.\\nSo it could be things like budget adherence,\\ntimeline accuracy, or the quality of deliverables.\\nSo I've loaded ChatGPT back up\\nand again, we are continuing from the same chat\\nthat we've been showcasing throughout this video.\\nNow, what we can do here is we could say something like,\\n\\\"Here is the initial budget,\\\"\\nand then attach it.\\n\\n\\\"Compare the projected budget\\nagainst actual spending,\\nhighlight any significant variances\\nand possible reasons.\\\"\\nSo that's just one potential prompt that you could use\\nfor further in-depth analysis.\\nI just wanted to give you an idea\\nas to what you could do at this particular stage,\\nbut you have various options here.\\nAs I say, it could be anything like timeline as well.\\nBut yeah, just have a little experiment here,\\nand it also depends on your project\\nand what you're looking to analyze.\\n\\nStep five, synthesize insights and recommendations.\\nSo this particular part of the process, you can ask ChatGPT\\nto summarize the key findings from the analysis.\\nFocus on successes, areas for improvement\\nand recommendations for future projects.\\nSo I've headed back into ChatGPT,\\njust to give you an example prompt here.\\n\\\"Summarize the key insights\\nfrom the project outcomes versus objectives analysis.\\n\\nProvide recommendations for addressing gaps\\nand leveraging strengths in future projects.\\\"\\nJust want to make sure these are spelt correctly\\nand then hit that.\\nSo here's just another example prompt\\nof how we can run analysis from our initial objectives\\nand also the actual outcomes.\\nSo here for instance, we are getting some recommendations\\nto strengthen our training\\nand support the product stability.\\n\\nWe need to leverage our project management strengths.\\nWe need to gather and utilize feedback.\\nSo really, really interesting\\nand important insights that we can use\\nto improve the chances of success on any future projects,\\nparticularly those where there's a new product involved.\\nUsing AI tools like ChatGPT to analyze how a project\\nperformed against its initial targets\\noffers a comprehensive nuanced understanding\\nof project success.\\nThis method not only highlights areas of achievement,\\nbut also uncovers valuable lessons\\nfor continuous improvement.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5926327\",\"duration\":418,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Gather post-project analysis insights

what information\\nand data would be best to leverage here.\\n\\nSo I have now opened ChatGPT\\nto give you an example prompt, which you can use\\nto get an understanding of what information to collect.\\nSo I want to conduct some post-project analysis.\\nWhat documents and,\\nor you could put /data,\\nwould be best\\nto provide you\\nso that you can provide the most insightful output?\\nNow, what's really useful about this particular prompt\\nis you can use this at any stage of your project.\\n\\nIf you're not quite sure what to do next\\nor where to take the process,\\nyou can always ask it questions like this.\\nSo here are the recommendations, project charter,\\nproject plan, the financial documents, say budget reports\\nor cost-benefit analysis.\\nWe've got some

for improvement,\\nassess financial management,\\nand understand stakeholder satisfaction.\\n\\nSo we've got quite a lot that we can now go\\nand pull together for the next step of the process.\\nStep two, the analysis with ChatGPT.\\nSo at this point, you want to input your data into ChatGPT,\\nasking it to perform an analysis to identify trends,\\nsuccesses, and areas for improvement.\\nSo I've headed back into ChatGPT just to show you\\nhow this could work.\\n\\nSo you could say something\\nlike identify the top three successes\\nand challenges based on the following.\\nAnd then what you could do is you could copy\\nand paste any one of these documents in,\\nor you could say, based on the attached,\\nclick the paperclip icon\\nand then attach, say the project charter\\nor the project plan.\\nSo that's one way of doing it.\\nSo I have opened a final project report as an example\\nof how you would essentially do this.\\n\\nSo I'm just going to copy all of this down.\\nSo this is for this particular project.\\nI want to copy all of down, press Control + C.\\nI've headed back into ChatGPT, and I'm now pasting it\\nafter this prompt\\njust to show you the process.\\nOkay, so that's essentially how you would do it.\\nYou could put this in quotation marks just to showcase\\nto ChatGPT that this is the start and end of the document.\\nSo identify the top three successes\\nand challenges based on the following.\\nAnd then you'd hit submit.\\n\\nAnd as you can see, it is now providing\\nthat analysis for us.\\nSo it's suggesting that we have effective client onboarding,\\nhigh client satisfaction, and a time efficiency as well.\\nHowever, we've got a budget overrun, got a resource issue,\\nand our forecasting and planning for customization,\\nwe need to take a look at.\\nStep three, deep dive into specific areas.\\nSo with the initial insights from ChatGPT,\\nyou can see if you can identify areas for deeper analysis.\\n\\nSo back into ChatGPT,\\nanother prompt that you could use at this particular stage\\nis something like this.\\nCan you suggest any other areas\\nwe should deep dive into\\nor explore for further analysis\\nthat would benefit future projects\\nat the organization?\\nThat is another kind of prompt you can use\\nto help get an idea of where to take your analysis.\\n\\nSo it's suggesting that we take a look into the financials,\\nsuch as the return on investment or the cost drivers.\\nIt's suggesting that we look into the process.\\nMaybe it's the onboarding process or the feedback loop.\\nIt's suggesting we look at staff\\nand resources, particularly training.\\nIt's suggesting that we look at risk management\\nand our mitigation strategies and our contingency plans.\\nIt's also suggesting that we look at our client interaction\\nand the customization required for it\\nand some post-project review techniques.\\n\\nSo this is really, really useful prompt\\nthat I suggest that you use.\\nStep four, prepare your report.\\nFinally, you want to ask ChatGPT to help you compile\\na comprehensive post-project analysis report.\\nNow, there's certain things that this report should contain,\\nsuch as your findings, your insights, lessons learned,\\nand recommendations for future projects.\\nSo going back into ChatGPT, this is the kind of prompt\\nthat you can use.\\n\\nCreate a draft of a post-project analysis report,\\nincluding all insights, challenges, successes,\\nand lessons learned.\\nSo that's the kind of prompt that you can use here.\\nAnd you'll notice straight away,\\nthis is the heading of the document.\\nWe've got an area for the project summary,\\nand it's pulled in information that it's been able\\nto acquire from the existing chat, the history of the chat.\\n\\nGot a project overview.\\nSo here is the elements that we asked for, project overview,\\nkey successes, key challenges.\\nSo you get the idea here.\\nNow, this is a really, really important report\\nthat we could issue to several different stakeholders.\\nNow, perhaps one of the most important areas\\nof this is the lessons learned.\\nNow, this is what we're going to be using to help us ensure\\nthat any

ChatGPT to create the templates\\nto acquire this information.\\nSo I have just loaded ChatGPT to show you\\nhow we can create this document.\\nSo it's a very simple prompt.\\nAll we need to say is create a lessons learned template\\nthat I can send out to project stakeholders.\\nNow, what you may want to do at this point\\nis you may want to be a bit more specific.\\nSo you could say something like,\\nsend out to internal project stakeholders.\\nYou might also want to include something\\nlike format the template and ensure the template\\nis logically created.\\n\\nInclude questions for the submitter.\\nSo, as you can see here,\\nI've been a little bit more specific in terms\\nof the kind of format we're after.\\nSo here we go.\\nThere's an area of the project overview.\\nNow, what we may want to do is ahead of sending this out,\\nkind of pre-filling some of this information.\\nSo we might want to put in here something like Project Alpha\\nin the context of this course.\\nProject duration, we could put, you know,\\nsay, Q1, 2024, to Q4, 2024.\\n\\nProject lead would be say, us, the project manager,\\nand the date of the report,\\nthe submitter could enter that information.\\nNow here are the questions that it's provided us with.\\nWas the project successful?\\nShortfalls or areas that did not meet expectations.\\nObjectives and outcomes.\\nWere the projects objectives met?\\nIf not, why were they not met?\\nWhat were the major factors influencing the outcomes?\\nKey challenges and solutions.\\nWhat unexpected challenges arose during the project?\\nSo you've got a series of different questions\\nthat the submitter can basically provide answers to.\\n\\nAnd there's an error for stakeholder feedback.\\nSo this is really, really comprehensive.\\nSo this is absolutely fantastic.\\nThere's also instructions for completing the template.\\nNow, you could also do that.\\nYou could say something like, you know,\\na prompt at this stage would be,\\nprovide a helpful document to send along\\nwith the template to help the submitter\\nprovide the best feedback possible.\\nYou could send that.\\nYou could use this prompt at this stage,\\nand then you've got an accompanying document\\nthat will just ensure that you get\\nthe best insights as possible.\\n\\nStep two, conduct analysis.\\nAt this point, you can input information acquired\\nby different stakeholders.\\nYou can put that into ChatGPT for analysis\\nand to identify key lessons.\\nSo, I've reopened ChatGPT to show you this part\\nof the process in action.\\nSo I'm going to remove this for now,\\nand I'm actually going to open up some feedback\\nthat I've received from some internal stakeholders.\\nSo, on screen are some lessons learned documents\\nthat I have received back.\\n\\nThe first from Jane Doe, who is a project coordinator,\\nand the second one is by Michael Smith,\\nwho is a marketing specialist.\\nSo they receive the same template.\\nThat's so important that you provide the same template\\nto all of your stakeholders.\\nThey're split up into different sections\\nwith some questions throughout,\\nand they've given their own respective answers.\\nNow what I'm going to do at this stage\\nis I'm just going to select all of the information here.\\nOkay?\\nSo I'm going to copy this\\nbecause I want to paste this into ChatGPT.\\n\\nSo I've gone back into ChatGPT.\\nNow what I want to say is something like a prompt like this.\\nSummarize the key findings\\nfrom these lessons learned template submissions, colon,\\nand then paste it in.\\nNow what you could also do, at this stage,\\nis you could have saved that document\\nand you could have attached it.\\nThat's another means of just pulling the data in.\\nI'm only using two lesson learned template submissions,\\nbut you could do this for as many as you have.\\n\\nSo for instance, you could do this with 10 submissions.\\nI'm just showing you the process here.\\nHit Submit.\\nAnd now we just need to wait for ChatGPT\\nto do the analysis.\\nSo here it is providing a summary of the key findings,\\nthe successes, the challenges.\\nThis is a really easy and quick way\\nto essentially quickly analyze a lot\\nof information at once.\\nSo instead of having to go through these submissions\\nmanually and one by one\\nand almost doing some kind of analysis in some kind of file,\\nyou're doing this all in one place,\\nand it's drawing out the kind of recurring themes here.\\n\\nSo it's really, really useful.\\nIt's even given us some recommendations\\nfor future projects via this particular prompt.\\nSo it's really, really useful at this stage.\\nStep three is to share your findings.\\nSo you should look to distribute\\nthe documented lessons learned among your team\\nand also any relevant stakeholder\\nwho is interested in the project.\\nSo as an example, this could be senior management.\\nSo I've gone back into ChatGPT\\nand the same chat that we have been using thus far.\\nAnd here, I want to say something like draft\\nand email to share the lessons learned with the...\\n\\nI'm going to say project team,\\nbut you could use different stakeholders here\\nas kind of previously suggested.\\nSo we could say with senior management.\\nYou could also be a lot more specific.\\nSo you could kind of mention the tone\\nthat you want the email sent in.\\nYou could be a bit more specific\\nas to who is on the project team.\\nSo there's ways of altering this prompt as well.\\nBut here is the output.\\nWe've got a subject,\\nrecap and key takeaways from Project Alpha.\\nDear team, I hope this message find you well.\\nAs you wrap up Project Alpha,\\nI want you to take a moment\\nfrom our recent project completion.\\n\\nSo here we've got the project successes,\\nchallenges encountered, areas for improvement,\\nlessons learned, moving forward.\\nSo really, really useful.\\nAnd then what I like about this at the bottom,\\nthank you all for your hard work and dedication.\\nSo it's just really personal as well, and it's a really,\\nreally good base email template to leverage.\\nYou could also use this for kind of any email\\nthat you use going forward.\\nSo I'm using this for Project Alpha,\\nbut let's just say we completed another project,\\nsay Project Beta.\\nThen we could just use\\nthis same template for that going forward.\\nWe could even open up this chat\\nand we could say something like,\\nI now want you to create this email for a different project.\\n\\nAnd then you could just basically input\\nall of the key lessons learned, et cetera.\\nStep four, implement changes.\\nSo you can use these insights to inform future project plans\\nand training materials.\\nImplementing a lessons learned strategy with AI tools\\nlike
