which trust driver is broken\\nand whether it's intentional or not.\\n\\nFor example, the product or service that didn't work well\\nor failed to live up to our promises, competence,\\nis different than a massive scandal\\nabout manipulating the balance sheets\\nto make the company's stock prices go up.\\nIntegrity, regardless of what happened,\\na trust breach is the result of a faulty internal

involve:\\nAcknowledging the issue.\\nIf we make mistakes or experience setbacks\\nthat lead to a loss of customer trust,\\nacknowledging them openly and honestly is crucial.\\nFor example, let's say that we work in a software company\\nand we experienced the data breach\\nthat compromised the personal data of our customers.\\nAcknowledging the problem\\nand admitting the fault promptly demonstrates transparency,\\nwhich is a key component of rebuilding trust.\\n\\nThis might involve issuing a public statement,\\ncontacting every individual customer\\nwho was affected, et

won't happen again.\\n\\nThey involve fixing the system.\\nAfter acknowledging and apologizing,\\nit's important to take concrete steps\\nto rectify the situation, mitigate the damage,\\nand prevent it from happening again.\\nFollowing the data breach,\\nwe must conduct a thorough investigation\\nto identify the root cause of the breach\\nin our systems or processes.\\nBased on the findings,\\nwe

kept.\\nMonitoring and adapting.\\nAfter fixing the issue,\\nwe should continuously monitor\\ncustomer sentiment and feedback all the time\\nto understand the effectiveness of our efforts.\\n\\nThen,

specifications\\nestablished for customer service.\\nPut simply, they're established guidelines\\nfor your customer service.\\nThey help you navigate what needs\\nto happen consistently with your customers,\\nand ultimately help you to find\\nwhat great quality looks like.\\nThere are three things you'll want to consider\\nwhen establishing quality standards.\\nOne is customer expectations.\\nWith service, unlike manufacturing,\\nthere's no tangible product.\\n\\nSo when you're looking at setting standards,\\nyou need to take into consideration\\nthe customer's perception of how well your service\\nmeets his or her expectations.\\nSecond, you'll look at your organization's\\nvision, mission and values.\\nEvery organization has a unique personality,\\nwhich should shine through in quality standards.\\nHere are two examples:\\nNorthwestern Mutual,\\nthe U.S. based financial services company\\nfounded well over a century ago,\\nhas built a reputation for stability.\\n\\nTheir customer service is professional and effective.\\nThank you Mr. Cleveland, enjoy the rest of your day.\\nMOO.com is a fast-growing, London-based\\ndesign and printing company.\\nThey encourage their team to, in their words,\\nbe passionate, lovely, and ambitious.\\nTheir approach is more playful,\\nhave an awesome day, Brad.\\nIn both examples, quality standards help guide services\\nthat are right for these brands.\\nYou'll also need to consider stakeholders,\\nas you build your quality standards.\\n\\nStakeholders are individuals or groups\\nwho influence the direction of the organization,\\nor are impacted by it.\\nEmployees, shareholders, suppliers, and regulators\\nare all examples.\\nLegal requirements, for example,\\naround privacy or data security,\\nshould be reflected in your quality standards.\\nAnd if your organization is seeking\\nformal recognition for quality,\\nthere are organizations that have specific requirements.\\nA well known example is ISO,\\nthe International Organization for Standardization.\\n\\nYour efforts to establish standards\\ncan become part of one of these certification programs,\\nif you choose.\\nAnd there may be important stakeholders in your sector.\\nIn travel, for example, Michelin and Forbes rate hotels,\\ntypically up to five stars.\\nThe Forbes Travel Guide uses more than 800 standards\\nas part of their assessment.\\nFor a five-star rating, for example,\\narriving guests must be greeted\\nand provided assistance within 60 seconds.\\nPhone calls are not to be left on hold\\nfor longer than 30 seconds\\nwithout offering a callback, and others.\\n\\nI encourage to consider all three of these sources\\nas you shape your quality standards.\\nAnd here's a final tip:\\nYour quality

a bunch of ways you can get input.\\nThe most common include surveys or focus groups\\nfrom customers, direct observation, role play,\\nfor example, just acting out scenarios in training.\\n\\nThere's recorded interactions,\\nmystery shoppers from someone who uses services\\nand then provides a report.\\nThere's analytics where system tools analyze speech or text\\nto look for patterns where that may apply.\\nAnd there's operational data such as repeat calls\\nor products returns.\\nThese sources can be categorized as either external,\\nmeaning directly from customers,\\nor internal, and you need both.\\nAt a minimum I recommend starting with\\nboth customer surveys, the external type,\\nand service observations that you conduct internally.\\n\\nSurveys are important because of the insight they provide\\ninto customer perceptions,\\nthat's what really matters right?\\nAnd they're usually conducted in the channel used,\\nfor example, text or email or prompts following a call,\\nor other methods depending on what the customer used.\\nResponse rates are high when they're short\\nand immediately follow an interaction.\\nPersonalized surveys can help boost\\nresponse rates even more.\\nFor example, the employees name and a picture\\ncan be included with the question,\\nhow did Brad do?\\nEmployees tend to like\\ngetting feedback directly from customers.\\n\\nNow a challenge in surveys is that response rates\\ntend to drop as you ask more questions.\\nIt's usually got to be pretty quick and easy,\\nso there's often a practical limit\\nto how much detailed information surveys can provide.\\nThat's where internal observations of service\\nare so valuable.\\nThese observations are generally conducted\\nby a supervisor or someone trained in quality observation,\\nand I recommend they be based\\ndirectly on your quality standards.\\nA common question I hear is, well okay,\\nhow many customer interactions do you need to observe then,\\nto know what's going on?\\nAnd that depends on your environment.\\n\\nFor example, many contact centers have a goal\\nof observing five to 10 customer interactions\\nper employee, per month.\\nIn other settings they can be infrequent,\\nsay an experienced forest ranger working with guests\\nin a national park.\\nOr they can be very frequent,\\nsay for a heavily supervised\\nsecurity screening

as well.\\nFor example, operational data on things like\\nrepeat contacts from customers,\\nthat can really help round out the picture.\\nMy advice is to keep your eyes on the prize,\\ntake steps to

As a leader of a Customer Service Organization.  \\n You're going to find that the demands on your time  \\n will be unyielding.  \\n Reviewing reports like the previous day's service level  \\n or preparing to meet with senior leadership  \\n to explain current quality scores  \\n can dominate your days with meetings  \\n and fill your nights with preparation.  \\n You may think to yourself, I'll just review the data,  \\n email my thoughts, and catch up with my team as I need them.  \\n If this is your plan,  \\n you're robbing your people of consistency  \\n and intentionality.  \\n As you take over a new customer service team,  \\n I strongly suggest that your first priority should be  \\n to fill your calendar with one-on-one meetings  \\n with your staff.  \\n In this lesson,  \\n I want to help you understand three different types  \\n of one-on-one meetings.  \\n That you should add to your calender.  \\n Let's start with Ten-Tens.  \\n Ten-Tens are meant to be weekly or biweekly touch points.  \\n Where the leader literally gets 10 minutes to speak.  \\n And the direct report gets 10 minutes as well.  \\n Although these meetings are planned,  \\n they are intended to be an exchange of thoughts  \\n and ideas from both participants.  \\n Less formal in nature than a monthly review,  \\n Ten-Tens are used to discuss the metric of the day  \\n or quick update on a policy change or training initiative.  \\n Because of the dynamic nature of a contact center,  \\n these quick well-placed meetings can be a powerful tool  \\n that can prevent a rough performance day  \\n into becoming a trend.  \\n Next, let's talk about the monthly review process.  \\n In the contact center world,  \\n months and quarters can meld together  \\n like an unending river of calls, chats, and emails.  \\n When I was a senior leader  \\n of a large monolithic credit card company,  \\n one lesson I learned was that  \\n for the contact center leaders,  \\n the performance needs to be measured in chunks.  \\n And what better chunks are there than months.  \\n Formally reviewing and documenting the monthly performance  \\n of your leaders individually accomplishes several things  \\n for the leader of a customer service team.  \\n It gives you the opportunity  \\n to acknowledge strong performance  \\n or reset strategy and stem the tide of subpar performance.  \\n A monthly review implies a focus on continuous improvement.  \\n Reemphasizing the fact that strong performance  \\n must be earned consistently  \\n and then know lifetime achievement awards  \\n in contact centers.  \\n Finally, this facilitates a clearer, simpler  \\n annual review process  \\n as you've been comparing performance to goal all year long,  \\n no surprises.  \\n Finally, let's discuss the development action player or DAP.  \\n There's so much data in the contact center  \\n that a leader in a customer service environment  \\n can reduce management and leadership  \\n to merely the pursuit of achieving metrics.  \\n And we all know this is not the case.  \\n In order to grow individuals  \\n for future leadership opportunities  \\n and to build bench strength,  \\n a leader should create a development action plan  \\n for their team members.  \\n Most development action plans are created  \\n after the semi-annual or annual review process.  \\n This document should simply record two to three smart goals  \\n as well as steps and resources needed  \\n to achieve those goals.  \\n The smart goals should be focused on  \\n relevant leadership competencies,  \\n such as effective communication,  \\n managing change, or creating strategy and vision.  \\n Just to name a few.  \\n Please don't let this document be a relic  \\n in your employee's file.  \\n Pull it out quarterly  \\n and discuss the progress towards the goals.  \\n If you are accepting a new assignment  \\n as a customer service team leader,  \\n please begin your 90 day plan by scheduling one-on-ones  \\n individual monthly reviews  \\n and develop an action plan meetings with your people.  \\n If that window has closed,  \\n I would encourage you to assess the value of the meetings  \\n on your current calendar  \\n and make these individual meetings a priority.  \\n You will create a rhythm and a cadence that is essential  \\n to driving performance in a contact center.  \\n In addition to this,  \\n your people will know that they are the difference.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2320825\",\"duration\":229,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Skip-level meetings\",\"fileName\":\"2975167_01_02_AU15_Skip\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Cookie chats are effect ways to connect with your frontlline staff in a non-intimidating way.

Waterman  \\n in the book, In Search of Excellence:  \\n Lessons from America's Best- Run Companies.  \\n MBWA is a simple concept of getting out of your office  \\n and interacting with your frontline employees  \\n in their environment, or on the floor,  \\n as we say in the contact center.  \\n This allows you to gain the benefit  \\n of gathering a random sampling of conversations,  \\n interactions, customer and employee issues, and the like.  \\n This is especially important  \\n in the contact center environment  \\n as the work can be repetitive  \\n and employees can feel isolated.  \\n More importantly,  \\n MBWA allows you to get a first hand account  \\n of the barriers your employees may feel  \\n to delivering for your customers.  \\n Now let's talk about Gemba Walks.  \\n Often the time the leader spends observing  \\n where the actual work is done  \\n should be more intentional and well planned  \\n than just managed by walking around.  \\n In this case,  \\n you may want to organize a Gemba Walk.  \\n The six sigma concept  \\n is a more purposeful observation  \\n of the work your people are performing  \\n with the specific intent  \\n of improving a KPI or process.  \\n When a leader goes a Gemba,  \\n he should have a plan  \\n that includes asking specific questions,  \\n documenting his or her observations,  \\n and taking a colleague, peer, or customer with him.  \\n Don't get the two confused.  \\n MBWA is about satisfaction, connection, and engagement.  \\n Going to Gemba is a systemic way  \\n to connect with your people  \\n by adding value to your customer journey.  \\n Let's talk a little bit about technology.  \\n Your technology can be an enabler  \\n to connecting with your people.  \\n If part of your organization works from home,  \\n set aside some time taking it out in a chatroom.  \\n You can often make yourself available  \\n for questions for a set period  \\n of time during your day.  \\n You can also use your laptop,  \\n or your tablet,  \\n to work while on the calls on the floor,  \\n or in the lunchroom.  \\n I call this Remote Work Contact Center Hangout Suites.  \\n Getting out of your office  \\n and working where your people are can be powerful.  \\n This week, spend some time on your call center floor.  \\n To ensure this goal gets accomplished,  \\n schedule it in your calendar  \\n with other meetings and projects.  \\n Although you like to be spontaneous,  \\n you must be intentional about setting aside this time.  \\n Find a peer or a direct report  \\n that will hold you accountable for doing this.  \\n Set a goal of spending a specific amount of time  \\n on the floor each week.  \\n You will find that this investment  \\n of time to be a small sacrifice  \\n and well worth the effort.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2319176\",\"duration\":284,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Monthly business reviews\",\"fileName\":\"2975167_01_04_AU15_Reviews\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"It's important to create a discipline around a balanced scorecard.

 \\n During this lesson, you will learn the elements  \\n of a highly productive monthly business review.  \\n Let's first discuss the demographics.  \\n As stated before, this meeting should be the pinnacle event  \\n in the month of your customer service team.  \\n If possible, the leaders should be in the same room,  \\n and the meeting should be held no more  \\n than 10 to 12 days after the month closes.  \\n If you wait any longer than that,  \\n the information may appear dated, stale, and untimely.  \\n If expense prevents the team from being together physically,  \\n a good remote meeting technology with video  \\n will serve the same purpose.  \\n The agenda should be published in advance  \\n with the opportunity for the leaders of each department  \\n to give a quick data-driven update  \\n on their department's performance.  \\n In order to keep the meeting productive,  \\n you should assign roles  \\n such as facilitator, note taker, and time keeper.  \\n Minutes posted timely after the meeting  \\n ensures followup items are tended to immediately.  \\n Rotating these roles keeps everyone on their toes.  \\n Lastly, although the agenda is formal in time,  \\n you should leave time for questions and discussion.  \\n This is especially important when the meeting  \\n is cross-functional and includes guests.  \\n Next, let's talk about the monthly business review report  \\n I call the package.  \\n There's a great deal of data available  \\n in a customer service organization.  \\n Most customer service teams manage multiple channels  \\n including sales calls, service calls, emails, chats,  \\n and even communication by text.  \\n During the monthly business review,  \\n it is important that one package is pulled together  \\n as a true data source for the entire team to review.  \\n It must be agreed upon as the true data source,  \\n as you do not want each business leader  \\n providing their own data.  \\n A data package should be produced a week prior  \\n to the meeting to give leaders an opportunity  \\n to question any discrepancies.  \\n I would make the package as detailed as possible  \\n with source references on each page.  \\n It is not the intent for the team  \\n to cover every page of the packet.  \\n However, it is important that the information is available  \\n in case the rich discussion leads to questions.  \\n Finally, lets talk about who attends these meetings.  \\n An effective monthly business review  \\n needs the right people in attendance.  \\n As a leader of a customer service organization,  \\n the mandatory attendance of your direct reports is a must.  \\n Beyond that, adding the leaders of your support organization  \\n is an effective way to drive performance improvement  \\n and innovation, inviting in diverse perspectives.  \\n This is especially important if those critical support units  \\n report outside of the customer service team.  \\n These guests can include information technology,  \\n human resources, project management, recruiting,  \\n and marketing, just to name a few.  \\n It would also be great for call center leaders  \\n to have those departments give updates periodically  \\n to your team on a regular basis of processes and procedures  \\n that impact your operation.  \\n Once again, these updates should fit  \\n into the existing agenda and be rich in data  \\n that can be reviewed prior to the meeting.  \\n The type of discussion and innovation that can be derived  \\n from this type of cross-functional group  \\n can drive improvements in your customer experience.  \\n If your monthly business review is sporadic  \\n and less organized than what has been described,  \\n I encourage you to add a few  \\n of the elements mentioned to your meeting.  \\n Expanding your list of attendees  \\n and welcoming their feedback may be a good first step.  \\n A timed agenda,  \\n is a great start.  \\n Creating a data-rich monthly business review report  \\n with year-to-date run charts detailing the performance  \\n of your key contact center metrics is a great goal  \\n and is guaranteed to transform your organization.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

Like were you satisfied with  \\n the service you received on this call, chat or email?  \\n As your organization matures,  \\n you may want to add a question  \\n that captures net promoter score or NPS.  \\n This is all about having  \\n your current customer recommend your services.  \\n NPS can be captured by adding the simple question.  \\n Would you recommend our service to a friend  \\n or a family member?  \\n The next step on this continuum is  \\n to capture customer effort.  \\n This helps to ensure that your services are easy  \\n and simple to use. You can capture effort by asking  \\n the question on a scale of one to five,  \\n one being the easiest and five being the most difficult,  \\n how easy was it to use our services?  \\n CSAT, NPS and effort,each capture a different aspect of  \\n the customer experience  \\n and they each can be valuable in improving  \\n the customer journey. The next thing I'd like  \\n you to think about is using verbatim feedback  \\n as a daily habit.  \\n When I was director of global customer care  \\n for a large retail organization,  \\n I would start out each day by reviewing  \\n the verbatim feedback from my customer surveys.  \\n Unlike the statistical data,  \\n collected from a survey verbatim feedback allows  \\n you to get closer to the customer experience  \\n in their own words. As a discipline,  \\n I reviewed five or 10 of these comments to start my day.  \\n This afforded me several benefits.  \\n It gave me an opportunity  \\n to catch an associate doing something right,  \\n and send a quick note, acknowledging the great work.  \\n Verbatim feedback may give some insight  \\n into broader performance issues from the day before.  \\n It was a day where your center experienced long wait times  \\n or average handle times.  \\n The actual feedback from  \\n the customer may give a greater insight into  \\n technical or personnel issues.  \\n Starting your day with the words of customers helps  \\n you to view your business from  \\n the customer perspective all day,  \\n as you attend meetings with your team  \\n and your colleagues.Now what are  \\n you going to do with all that feedback?  \\n Collecting feedback is the easy part, technology  \\n and people can help you record the experiences of  \\n your customers, but what are  \\n you going to do with all that feedback?  \\n Once you capture it, when you capture feedback for  \\n your customers, it creates an expectation that  \\n you're going to act on that feedback.  \\n We tell organizations who'll often call customers back.  \\n This works well. As long as you ask for permission,  \\n as you collect the customer data,  \\n what's important here is to empower  \\n the caller to help solve the customer's issue if possible.  \\n This solution could be in the form of a refund, replacement,  \\n a coupon to encourage the customer to try us again,  \\n or it could be as simple as an apology.  \\n The expense of this type of program  \\n has to be measured against real metrics,  \\n such as customer retention percentage or churn rate.  \\n So here's what I want you to do. Take time to invest  \\n in a systematic method of collecting customer feedback.  \\n There are literally dozens of cloud based systems  \\n that can help you create a survey to  \\n measure customer feedback for  \\n your specific customer interactions in  \\n your specific channel.

Customer service leadership is important  \\n for several key reasons.  \\n One's probably obvious,  \\n and the other two maybe not so much.  \\n So let's take a look at them here.  \\n One reason effective leadership is so essential  \\n and probably no surprise  \\n is that customer expectations are evolving rapidly.  \\n The economy global trends,  \\n things that specifically impact customers,  \\n all influence their expectations.  \\n When customers experience an innovation  \\n with one organization, they now know what's possible  \\n and begin to expect the same of others.  \\n When they need you most,  \\n they especially take note of how you deal.  \\n Do you have their back?  \\n So you got to continually revisit what good service means,  \\n and that takes leadership.  \\n The stakes are high too.  \\n I mean, it's easy for customers to tell others  \\n about bad experiences through reviews and social channels,  \\n but if you consistently deliver great service,  \\n the connected world's a powerful friend.  \\n Companies that stand out in competitive markets,  \\n Trader Joe's and groceries, USA and financial services,  \\n Hot Topic and clothing and accessories and others.  \\n They say that up to 70% of their new customers  \\n come through referrals.  \\n A second and perhaps less visible reason  \\n that leadership's important is the potential  \\n for service to provide value to others  \\n across the organization.  \\n It's customer service that sees the early warning signs  \\n of product or service glitches.  \\n It's service that knows  \\n how well we're keeping our promises to customers.  \\n It's those in customer service who know best  \\n when communication's unclear  \\n or where systems don't work as intended.  \\n It's customer service that sees so clearly  \\n where there are ways that we can innovate  \\n in products and services.  \\n When captured and shared this sense I can help virtually  \\n every other part of the organization,  \\n but it takes leadership to make sure  \\n these opportunities don't slip through our fingers.  \\n A third reason leadership's important  \\n is that finding the best approach  \\n to customer service is a discovery process.  \\n You know, there's no one template,  \\n no cookie cutter approach that works for everybody.  \\n Many organizations don't get nearly the return they could  \\n from their investments in customer service.  \\n And I've found there are some misconceptions  \\n about service that are all too common  \\n and can get in the way.  \\n They include things like, well,  \\n service is just a necessary cost to be minimized,  \\n or service is not a differentiator for us,  \\n being okay is good enough, or let's just benchmark others,  \\n we'll find the formula to apply,  \\n or great service is expensive, right?  \\n And actually, it's poor service is expensive, as we'll see.  \\n To any of these views exist in your organization,  \\n leadership is required to build consensus  \\n around a positive direction.  \\n Delivering effective customer service  \\n has never been more important.  \\n And with the right approach,  \\n applying the principles we'll cover in this course,  \\n you have the opportunity to make a difference  \\n with your customers, your colleagues, and employees,  \\n and all who benefit when the organization succeeds.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3092455\",\"duration\":191,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Aligning service with your organization's vision and mission\",\"fileName\":\"2483362_en_US_01_02_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"This video helps you to: 1) identify three essential aspects of aligning customer service with the organization's vision and mission; 2) cite examples of how to establish clear direction and effective standards; and 3) summarize the importance of ensuring that the organization's brand and personality shines through in every detail of service.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":12415435,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

Bogle, the late founder of Vanguard,  \\n which is now the largest mutual fund company in the U.S.,  \\n personally helped handle customer calls  \\n in the contact center throughout his career.  \\n He often commented on how hard the job is,  \\n but he picked up invaluable insight from customers  \\n and what they need and want.  \\n Second, trust your instincts.  \\n If you prefer clean restrooms when you're on a road trip,  \\n if you'd like to run a question by your insurance company  \\n on a weekend, because hey, you're busy the rest of the week,  \\n these may be obvious opportunities.  \\n Companies such as Wawa and Geico have leveraged them  \\n into services that have helped build their brands.  \\n Finally, and above all, make service easy  \\n and resolve issues quickly.  \\n The research is very clear.  \\n This is what customers most want.  \\n It's important for anyone with a leadership role  \\n in customer service to keep tabs on customer expectations.  \\n This is key to shaping services that truly hit the mark.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3099355\",\"duration\":246,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Establishing a key performance indicator\",\"fileName\":\"2483362_en_US_01_05_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"This video summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of four high level measures: customer satisfaction (Csat), net promoter score (NPS), customer effort score, and sentiment analysis.

 \\n Next, you'll consider routing.  \\n How is each customer going to be routed to the right person  \\n or team who can help them with the issue?  \\n The next component summarizes the person  \\n and technology resources required.  \\n Which employees and which systems will come into play  \\n for each type of interaction?  \\n The eighth component of your plan  \\n summarizes information required.  \\n What information on customers, products, and services  \\n will need to be accessible?  \\n What information should be captured  \\n during the service interaction?  \\n In the next step, analysis and improvement,  \\n you'll define how information captured  \\n will be used to better understand customers  \\n and to improve products and services.  \\n In the final step, guidelines for deploying new services,  \\n your plan should summarize technology needs,  \\n investment guidelines, and other considerations  \\n as you bring new services into the mix.  \\n Now you might be thinking, whew, there's a lot to this,  \\n but I've found that, without fail,  \\n the thought you put into your strategy will come back to you  \\n in time, clarity, and better decisions.  \\n And I've also found that teams collaborate more effectively  \\n when working from a common plan.  \\n You'll find a summary of the 10 components  \\n of a customer access strategy  \\n in the guide to additional resources.  \\n So start simple, begin to define these 10 components.  \\n You'll soon see the benefits  \\n of having a common plan to work from.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3098467\",\"duration\":83,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Stories from the field: Customer access strategy\",\"fileName\":\"2483362_en_US_02_02_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":4788663,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" (upbeat music)  \\n - In my work with organizations,  \\n I've found that customer access strategies  \\n are a bit like business plans.  \\n Some are well-documented, and others exist only in pieces  \\n and in the heads of various managers.  \\n Too often, the latter's the case.  \\n But there are standout examples of plans  \\n that are effective and up-to-date.  \\n A mobile phone company I've worked with  \\n has a well-organized customer access strategy  \\n which is a secure internal webpage employees can access.  \\n It consists of a cleanly designed homepage,  \\n the centerpiece, then there are links to files  \\n that make up the different parts of the plan,  \\n such as customer segments, access numbers,  \\n lists of customer service team members and so forth.  \\n It's all accessible from that one homepage.  \\n The most impressive aspect of the plan to me  \\n is that it notes who's responsible  \\n for keeping each area of the plan current.  \\n And each part of the plan has an updated on date notation.  \\n The plan is current,  \\n and they don't make major decisions without referring to it.  \\n Customers don't think of contact channels or departments.  \\n They simply say, \\\"I need to contact XYZ company.\\\"  \\n The best-led organizations know this,  \\n and they cultivate customer access strategies  \\n that enable their brands to shine through.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3094396\",\"duration\":247,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Instilling service supporting metrics\",\"fileName\":\"2483362_en_US_02_03_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"This video summarizes the seven key aspects of service that must be reflected in metrics, cites examples of specific metrics that support each, and describes how to establish a palette of metrics that encourages focus in the right areas.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":14312377,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - When it comes to metrics, I've got good news.  \\n Now you could cover a parking lot if you printed out  \\n all the possible reports on customer service.  \\n But there are just seven areas  \\n that you most need to pay attention to.  \\n If you're trying to track too many things,  \\n the really important things won't get  \\n the attention they deserve anyway.  \\n These seven aspects of service build on each other  \\n and form a very effective framework for identifying  \\n the metrics that make sense.  \\n The first is anticipating customer needs  \\n or the workload forecast.  \\n If you don't have an accurate prediction  \\n of how many customers you'll be serving  \\n and what their needs will likely be,  \\n it's going to be very difficult to deliver effective service.  \\n And that's true for any kind of operation  \\n from a small medical office  \\n to a large multi-site customer care center.  \\n So a good supporting metric would be tracking variance  \\n of forecast to actual.  \\n And get as specific as you need.  \\n How many customers will need help  \\n with their homeowner policies on Saturday morning?  \\n The next key aspect of customer service is related.  \\n You've anticipated the workload,  \\n now it's important to anticipate the staff  \\n and other resources required to handle it.  \\n For example, if you manage the emergency department  \\n of a hospital, it's essential to ensure you have  \\n the right number of physicians, nurses, and support staff  \\n in place at the right times.  \\n Now supporting metrics is variance of actual  \\n to plan schedules.  \\n Do you have the right skills in place at the right times?  \\n The next aspect of customer service is wait times  \\n or how accessible you are.  \\n Accessibility is really an outcome of the first two aspects  \\n of customer service, predicting workloads  \\n and getting the right resources in place at the right times.  \\n Supporting metrics here are customer wait times.  \\n Different terms such as service level or response time  \\n are used in different settings.  \\n Be sure to include all types of access,  \\n whether customers call, walk in or use other alternatives.  \\n Next is the quality of interactions.  \\n And this along with wait times is probably  \\n what most of us are thinking when we refer  \\n to customer service.  \\n What actually happens at the point of service delivery?  \\n Criteria such as understanding the customer's need,  \\n resolving the issue, accurately entering data  \\n and other aspects of quality are important.  \\n Both input from customer surveys and internal quality scores  \\n from samples of customer service interactions can be used  \\n as supporting metrics.  \\n The next essential area in delivering service  \\n is employee engagement.  \\n And by engagement, I mean the degree to which your employees  \\n are committed to your mission and the work they do.  \\n Studies resoundingly show that engaged employees  \\n provide better service.  \\n You can measure engagement through employee surveys  \\n and in things like retention.  \\n A high leverage, high value aspect of customer service  \\n is cross-functional, or what some call strategic value.  \\n What do you learn in customer service that would be helpful  \\n to other areas in improving products,  \\n services, and processes?  \\n Customer service can be such a powerful set  \\n of eyes and ears, and you'll want metrics  \\n to support these efforts.  \\n For example, take samples of the financial returns  \\n that these innovations deliver.  \\n Finally, what you're doing in all of these areas  \\n should ultimately be reflected  \\n in customer satisfaction and loyalty.  \\n The supporting metric can be a net promoter score,  \\n customer effort score, or similar.  \\n You can also look at behavior such as repeat business,  \\n reviews that customers post, and new customers  \\n who come from referrals.  \\n Here's my advice: Take inventory of these seven areas.  \\n Are you missing any?  \\n I encourage you to strengthen those areas where you're weak  \\n and eliminate metrics that aren't adding value  \\n that are just extra clutter.  \\n As a leader, having this pallet of metrics encourages focus  \\n in the right areas and leads to more consistency  \\n and strength in your services.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3095394\",\"duration\":211,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Putting yourself in your customer's shoes\",\"fileName\":\"2483362_en_US_02_04_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Many of the best decisions a leader makes comes through developing a good understanding of customers' perspectives and seeing things as they do.

recall a new restaurant with great food  \\n and impeccable service that quickly built a following.  \\n Referrals spread rapidly and reviews were positive.  \\n Before long, the waits to get in became longer,  \\n and to customers, this was just confirmation  \\n the restaurant was a great choice.  \\n But over time, the food became less predictable,  \\n and the service, less consistent.  \\n They became complacent,  \\n and the word of mouth that was working for them  \\n began to unravel and work the other direction,  \\n it was working against them.  \\n In less than two years, they were out of business.  \\n The number one key to sustaining great service is culture.  \\n The culture of doing the daily hard work  \\n to focus on what's best for customers.  \\n What do organizations with the most engaged employees  \\n and customer-focused cultures have in common.  \\n Here are the seven principles that really stand out.  \\n First, hire the right people.  \\n I had a successful customer service leader  \\n put it to me this way,  \\n \\\"We hire the passion and train the skills.\\\"  \\n And I agree.  \\n While it makes a lot of sense to recruit employees  \\n who have the skills you need,  \\n a drive and passion to help customers is a must-have.  \\n Next, I've observed a common theme  \\n among organizations that provide the best service.  \\n They put their employees first.  \\n Southwest Airlines,  \\n one of the world's most admired companies,  \\n post right on their website that,  \\n \\\"In our order of importance, we put our employees first,  \\n then our customers, then our shareholders.  \\n We believe that if we treat our employees right,  \\n they'll treat our customers right,  \\n and in turn that results in increased business and profits  \\n that make everyone happy.\\\"  \\n Another key principle is to empower and equip employees  \\n to make real-time decisions.  \\n You can't expect them to be effective  \\n unless they have the authority and means to help customers.  \\n The hotel Ritz-Carlton gives employees up to $2,000  \\n of discretion per day, per guest  \\n to resolve problems as the employee feels is appropriate.  \\n As the senior manager explains,  \\n \\\"Sometimes the most delightful wow moments  \\n happen in the blink of an eye.  \\n If employees are not empowered  \\n and need to cross layers of approval,  \\n those moments could be lost forever.\\\"  \\n Fourth, find ways to continuously keep the focus  \\n on customers rather than internal objectives.  \\n A large Cable company with a mixed reputation for service  \\n took the symbolic step of putting an empty chair  \\n in every planning meeting.  \\n That chair represents the customer.  \\n And those involves say it really means something  \\n to have a tangible picture of a customer  \\n sitting in those discussions.  \\n Next, take steps to communicate effectively.  \\n Effective leaders at all levels are predisposed  \\n to keeping teams in the know, good and bad,  \\n so that nobody's second guessing or wondering.  \\n And they listen.  \\n When employees have a stake  \\n in developing your approach to customer service,  \\n they tend to work hard to bring about a success.  \\n Employees of Homeroom, the popular mac and cheese restaurant  \\n in Oakland, California that has such raving fans,  \\n they pass along improvement ideas on index cards  \\n at the end of every shift.  \\n No idea is too small.  \\n Angling a refrigerator by just a few inches  \\n provided additional clearance in a busy corner.  \\n Sixth, to be sure to establish goals  \\n and objectives that support a customer-focused culture.  \\n A chain of hardware stores that once emphasized  \\n the number of customers served  \\n and how long those interactions take  \\n realized they were missing opportunities.  \\n The employee who points to the right aisle  \\n might not be nearly as effective  \\n as one who walks the customer to the right aisle.  \\n Along the way,  \\n they discover that the customer's project  \\n is part of a large remodel and a much bigger opportunity  \\n for the organization to serve and be a part.  \\n This renewed focus on customers  \\n has boosted satisfaction with customers  \\n and boosted business returns for the organization.  \\n Lastly, cultivate supporting tools and processes.  \\n And this doesn't necessarily mean  \\n you have to have the latest technology  \\n but several capabilities are especially helpful.  \\n These include knowing the customer's history  \\n and preferences,  \\n the means to capture helpful information  \\n on customers and issues,  \\n and good communication tools for internal collaboration.  \\n In some organizations,  \\n you can just feel the energy.  \\n And without fail, these principles will be at work.  \\n

- You don't have to be a technology expert  \\n to be an effective customer service leader.  \\n In fact, I've observed that some of the best leaders  \\n are decidedly, not technology experts,  \\n but they aren't afraid to ask some basic questions,  \\n \\\"How can we make things easier for our customers?\\\"  \\n \\\"How can we make things easier for our employees?\\\"  \\n Let's take a whirlwind tour through technology developments  \\n that are most impacting customer service.  \\n Here's one obvious trend  \\n that we've all been a part of in recent years,  \\n connectivity and collaboration tools  \\n enable employees to work from anywhere,  \\n virtual or hybrid work arrangements  \\n that include a mix of home and offices are here to stay.  \\n Today's technology has enable you  \\n to get any kind of customer interaction,  \\n phone, chat, text, social post or other,  \\n to the right place.  \\n And you could program in all kinds of routing criteria,  \\n such as information you have on the customer  \\n and employees who may be best suited for that interaction.  \\n The customer's phone number or account number  \\n can pull up and deliver files and relevant information  \\n before the employee even says, \\\"Hello.\\\"  \\n This applies to any customer-facing environment,  \\n from the small pizza restaurant that immediately knows  \\n what a customer ordered the last time,  \\n to the large tech support operation,  \\n where the agent can view  \\n and manage troubleshooting tickets without delay.  \\n Workforce optimization refers to tools used  \\n for forecasting, staffing, and scheduling.  \\n Popular tools include reports that highlight discrepancies  \\n between actual and planned schedules,  \\n and administrative software that empowers employees  \\n to make shift changes  \\n or request time off as needed.  \\n Many of these systems now integrate directly  \\n with payroll and financial systems.  \\n Quality monitoring systems record interactions  \\n and enable review for quality improvement purposes.  \\n Today, both the conversation and screen activities  \\n can be captured,  \\n and coaches can insert voice annotations  \\n into original recordings for training purposes.  \\n Short surveys delivered in the channels customers use  \\n can provide immediate insight  \\n and be correlated with other measures,  \\n such as internal quality monitoring.  \\n And speech or text analytics capabilities  \\n can quickly mine any number of interactions  \\n for critical issues and trends.  \\n There are many capabilities that can help you establish  \\n stronger relationships with customers.  \\n Today's tools enable you to see consolidative views  \\n of all the contacts customers have had  \\n with your organization.  \\n Fulfillment and tracking capabilities  \\n can integrate functions such as shipping,  \\n and provide proactive updates to customers.  \\n And artificial intelligence is making huge inroads  \\n into customer service,  \\n both in providing self-service capabilities,  \\n and as intelligent assistance,  \\n sitting alongside service representatives.  \\n And don't forget the technologies on the customer's end,  \\n mobile devices, apps, social platforms,  \\n and the investment customers are making in these tools  \\n and learning how to use them.  \\n That's all a part of our customer service ecosystem.  \\n The capabilities available to you are limited,  \\n really only by your imagination.  \\n And with cloud-based services that are provided  \\n on a cost-per-month or per-user basis,  \\n even the smallest companies have access  \\n to the most advanced capabilities.  \\n Here are three overall recommendations.  \\n One is ongoing,  \\n make sure that IT is available  \\n to support your customer service team as needed.  \\n For example, it doesn't work well for IT  \\n to run regular business hours  \\n and not be available to support your employees  \\n who are serving customers in extended hours.  \\n The second is forward-looking.  \\n Get involved in developing your technology roadmap  \\n and involve your customer service employees,  \\n ask them, \\\"What's working well and where are there gaps?\\\"  \\n Those closest to the work, as they are,  \\n they know it best and they can provide incredible insight  \\n into capabilities that would be most valuable.  \\n Lastly and above all, as a leader,  \\n keep asking the questions,  \\n \\\"How can we leverage technology to make things easier  \\n for our customers,

 \\n One is to hire capable people.  \\n As Collins and his team put it,  \\n great vision without great people is irrelevant.  \\n Another is to practice humility.  \\n Collins and his team refer to the mirror and the window  \\n to differentiate between Levels 4 and 5.  \\n Level 5 leaders look out the window  \\n to credit others for success  \\n and look in the mirror to take responsibility  \\n when things don't go as planned.  \\n Strive to see things as your customers do.  \\n A consultant I know tells of a recent domestic flight  \\n where he was sitting in one of the 12 seats in first class.  \\n Another passenger was getting a lot of attention,  \\n great service, and he learned that it was the airline's CEO  \\n who wanted to personally check in  \\n on how the airline service was going.  \\n My friend, never shy, leaned over and introduced himself  \\n and suggested to the CEO  \\n that he might want to move to the cabin  \\n where most of his customers were sitting.  \\n Seeing things as your customers do  \\n enables you to make changes to processes and policies  \\n and services that have staying power.  \\n Build strong systems and processes.  \\n The enduring successes of companies like Amazon and Apple  \\n and Disney are due in no small part  \\n to the systems and processes they put in place.  \\n Technology changes rapidly,  \\n but an intense focus on keeping things simple for customers  \\n has helped guide the investments these organizations make.  \\n Collins observed greatness is not a matter of circumstances.  \\n It's a matter of choice and discipline.  \\n I agree and I find that encouraging and inspiring.  \\n What's the strength you're building in your organization?

groups.\\n\\nYou want to continue to enhance the loyalty\\nof your top clients\\nand work to turn your lower-value clients\\ninto higher-value clients.\\nHere's a simple way to think about your customer base\\nand loyalty program.\\nI like to break them down into four subsets of customers.\\nYou have great customers, and they drive a lot of revenue.\\nYou want to structure things in a way\\nto keep these customers happy.\\nNext, you have customers who could be great\\nand who could drive a lot of revenue,\\nbut they don't currently, yet you see promise.\\n\\nThey show similar characteristics of your best customers.\\nYou want to structure things in a way to grow these clients.\\nThen you likely have clients who spend a lot of money\\nbut don't currently show much promise to grow beyond that.\\nThey're not necessarily engaged\\nor have an affinity to your brand.\\nUse your loyalty program to try and get them more engaged\\nand more excited to do business with you.\\nAnd finally, you have clients who don't spend much\\nand don't show a lot of future potential yet.\\n\\nYou want to structure things to get them excited\\nand spending more with you more often.\\nAgain, a question you need to ask\\nas you define your loyalty program,\\nis this an area you want to spend money?\\nThis is why I think a lot of loyalty programs\\nare done poorly.\\nThey give everyone the same punch card\\nand the same swipe card and the same perks.\\nBut not all customers are created equal.\\nOne of my clients, a small town local restaurant\\nstructured their loyalty program in this way.\\nThe first interesting thing that they did\\nwas that you had to pay\\nto be a part of their loyalty program.\\n\\nThe second thing that they did was they built perks\\nand

Instead of a basic loyalty program,\\nwhich might include a simple points program\\nor a card that treats all customers the same,\\nI teach my clients to build a ladder of loyalty.\\nHelping them better define their goals\\nand using the loyalty program\\nas a way to grow revenue and increase loyalty to your brand.\\nNew customers start at the bottom of the ladder\\nand as they become more loyal\\nthey climb further and further up the ladder.\\nTo create a world class ladder of loyalty\\nyou just need to follow six simple steps.\\n\\nStep one, define your objectives.\\nArticulate the objectives for your loyalty program.\\nObjectives might include increasing customer value\\nand profitability of various customer segments,\\ngrowing the size of your customer database,\\nincreasing the transaction size and frequency\\nof customer spending,\\nor increasing word of mouth\\nand recommendations amongst customers.\\nStep two, determine what you want to learn.\\n\\nWhat do you want to happen\\nas a result of your loyalty program?\\nThis helps determine the type of data\\nyou'll use your loyalty program to capture.\\nI would suggest the following data to start.\\nDemographic data, purchase frequency, transaction size,\\nand the recency of the customer's last purchase.\\nStep three, design your loyalty program.\\nEvery loyalty program must give customers\\nthe things they want,\\nrewards are a key component.\\n\\nFor a loyalty program to be truly effective\\nit must maintain a balance between rewards,\\noffers, and communication with customers\\nbased on their individual attitudes,\\npurchasing behaviors, demographics, and psychographics.\\nHere are some questions to get you thinking\\nabout how to structure your program.\\nIs it a points-based program?\\nIf so, how is the customer rewarded?\\nDo the points turn into a cash discount?\\nOr are customers able to redeem points for multiple perks.\\n\\nDo cardholders or members experience additional perks?\\nFor instance, do they receive an immediate discount\\nat the time of purchase?\\nDo they receive free shipping?\\nOr do they receive extended customer support?\\nDo you have any surprise gifts or bonuses\\nthat customers receive once they've spent a certain amount?\\nHere's a hint, you should.\\nHow often will you make exclusive offers to loyalty members?\\nStep four, identify your metrics of success.\\n\\nYour loyalty program will have costs associated with it\\nto maintain and distribute your incentives,\\nyour perks, and rewards.\\nSo what would make your program successful?\\nHow will you measure it?\\nFor example, if your objective\\nis to increase customer transaction size\\nor the frequency of purchase\\nthen obviously these are the areas you need to measure\\nto see if your program is actually delivering the result.\\nStep five, construct your program.\\nAside from building the ins and outs of how you'll recognize\\nand reward your customers,\\nyou need to think about how you'll structure your program.\\n\\nHow and when will you enroll customers?\\nWill there be a fee to join?\\nWhat will new members receive?\\nWill you have on-going communications or promotions?\\nIs everyone automatically a member?\\nStep six, surprise your customers constantly.\\nThe problem with building a loyalty program\\nthat's structured based on rewards\\nor even levels of loyalty\\nis that it can get stale rather quickly.\\nMost of these programs do.\\nAs big of a fan that I am of the Starbucks loyalty program,\\nit's gotten somewhat boring.\\n\\nI already know what gold level gets me.\\nThere's no surprise, it's the same old year after year.\\nFrom time to time you need to refresh your loyalty program\\nand the benefits associated with it for your customers.\\nOf course, if a customer expects to receive a certain reward\\nthat you've stipulated\\nthen it's not worth changing the reward\\nat the expense of upsetting the customer.\\nI'm simply talking about adding unexpected perks\\nfrom time to time.\\nCustomers should be constantly surprised.\\nSo these six steps will help you structure\\na solid loyalty program.\\n\\nAs you build your loyalty program\\nremember the concept of the ladder.\\nWhat could you provide to customers\\nas they increase in loyalty and move up the ladder?\\nIf you put a ladder in front of someone\\nthe only logical decision is to climb it\\nand your customers will tend to do the same.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3929211\",\"duration\":174,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Enhance your loyalty action plan with generative
