Design thinking has been around since the 1950's.  \\n It was first introduced as a novel way  \\n to approach business challenges.  \\n Much later people began applying design thinking  \\n to product design, such as digital products,  \\n as well as product development.  \\n Applying design thinking to design a development processes  \\n quickly proved its value.  \\n How?  \\n It effectively de-risk go to market plans.  \\n Let me explain that statement a bit further.  \\n Go to market is when a business invest the time  \\n and resources to bring a new product or feature to market,  \\n and de-risking is simply an efficient way  \\n of saying reduce risk.  \\n So companies discovered that applying design thinking  \\n was an effective tool in reducing the risk  \\n of developing new products.  \\n What other values does design thinking provide?  \\n Inherently, design thinking  \\n is both customer centric and iterative.  \\n These two traits, compliment product success and delivery.  \\n And by delivery I mean how we deliver a product to market,  \\n that may include development, production, and distribution.  \\n Or another way to look at it,  \\n how we create and put it into the hands of our customers.  \\n If a product solves a real problem and as delightful to use,  \\n people will buy it, use it often, and tell others.  \\n Success, that makes it hard to compete against as well,  \\n because another company has to convince people  \\n who are happy with one product to use another.  \\n The best way to ensure that you solve a real problem  \\n is to make the solution customer centric.  \\n We do that by learning what real customers need desire  \\n and how they behave.  \\n Design thinking is a great tool for discovering these.  \\n On the other hand, as product development teams  \\n apply design thinking, they can actually take advantage  \\n of the iterative nature of learning what works  \\n and trying new solutions.  \\n In this use, iterative is how you learn what works  \\n and what does not come up with a better potential solution  \\n and try it again.  \\n This repetitive cycle enables you  \\n to rapidly learn new things and then try applying it again.  \\n This works nicely with new versions of products  \\n being developed to stay competitive in the market.  \\n It also works very well  \\n with digital product development processes  \\n like Agile that utilize iterative approaches.  \\n Design thinking provides value,  \\n from solving business problems to product design,  \\n it's great at making sure the product is a good fit  \\n with the needs of customers.  \\n Being customer focused and iterative  \\n the process of informed refining  \\n is a powerful way to be more customer-focused.  \\n Because it ensures you're solving the right problem  \\n for the right people while continuing to deliver  \\n and compete in the market.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2893308\",\"duration\":188,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Empathize with your users\",\"fileName\":\"2875325_01_02_LA30_empUse\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how building empathy with your customers leads to better product experiences.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":40150287,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Having empathy for others is a great personality trait.  \\n Because having empathy for someone else  \\n means that you understand and share the feelings they have.  \\n Even if you are different, you can relate at some level  \\n and empathize with how they feel.  \\n In product design, when we're able to understand  \\n how our customers feel,  \\n we can provide them with solutions they need most.  \\n In turn, they will find much value in our product.  \\n With design thinking, we can build empathy  \\n in a way that is so rich with understanding  \\n that we can uncover problems they struggle most with  \\n and provide solutions tailored  \\n to their unique needs and desires.  \\n To unwrap this further, imagine for a moment,  \\n some product or service that you value greatly,  \\n if you can identify one that had such great value  \\n you recommended it to others.  \\n Maybe you told a good friend or wrote a really nice review  \\n that detailed why you love it so, so much.  \\n How did it make you feel?  \\n What words did you use to describe it?  \\n Did you compare it to another experience?  \\n Likely you may have used phrases like these  \\n to describe your thoughts.  \\n It was made for me.  \\n It was just what I needed.  \\n Unlike the last one I tried, this one works so well.  \\n They thought of everything.  \\n They were able to do that  \\n because they understood exactly what need you had  \\n and how best to provide the solution.  \\n Now, this sometimes can happen  \\n because someone identifies their own need  \\n and because they understand it so well  \\n are able to provide a great solution.  \\n But what happens when you are not your customer?  \\n Then you won't fully understand how they feel  \\n or what they need.  \\n So it is very difficult to design a product  \\n that you know suits them very well.  \\n Here is where you can leverage design thinking activities  \\n to build empathy for your customers.  \\n One example of an activity is user research,  \\n where you interview your customers  \\n and use techniques to uncover what they need  \\n and what criteria a successful solution must meet.  \\n Another example would be user testing,  \\n where you observe customers  \\n using your product or competitors.  \\n You learn what they like, and don't like,  \\n what works and what doesn't  \\n and most importantly, what's missing.  \\n This builds an understanding of how your customers feel  \\n and what types of solutions they desire,  \\n you're building empathy.  \\n Having empathy for others can help you  \\n design better products through understanding  \\n what they need and why.  \\n Design thinking can help you learn better empathy  \\n using activities and techniques that help you gain  \\n new understanding of your customers.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2891343\",\"duration\":156,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Define the problem and who you are solving it for\",\"fileName\":\"2875325_01_03_LA30_define\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how defining your users' unmet needs serves to frame what solutions you need to ideate in the next step.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":33332174,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

 \\n That's right, and the key to this prioritization  \\n lies in the understanding  \\n of the problems they are having and why, the problem space.  \\n By having a deep understanding  \\n of the problems our customers are facing,  \\n we know which ones cause the most trouble,  \\n and we know which ones  \\n have the most value for us to address.  \\n We are able to categorize them  \\n according to the level of trouble they are causing  \\n and the value relieving them could provide.  \\n We can then use these two data points to determine  \\n if all of our customers have the same problems,  \\n which ones share the same needs,  \\n and prioritize the solutions  \\n that will have the greatest impact,  \\n the combination that will deliver  \\n the most value to our customers.  \\n Imagine, for a moment, that you're trying  \\n to help a neighbor paint their fence.  \\n After all, you share the fence with them.  \\n So you start discussing when to paint.  \\n The neighbor begins to suggest some times,  \\n but then pauses and explains.  \\n They reveal to you that the fence needs some paint  \\n because the trees and bushes have grown so large,  \\n that they are brushing up against the fence.  \\n And the fence also has some areas where it needs repair.  \\n And one of the larger trees has actually grown against  \\n a large portion of the fence, pushing it over.  \\n Suddenly, you and your neighbor can't just paint the fence;  \\n you need to fix it.  \\n You've got plants that should be trimmed away from it,  \\n and you've got to figure out what to do about that tree.  \\n The tree is doing the most damage,  \\n and you can't paint behind it,  \\n so that becomes the priority.  \\n Next, you'll trim the plants back,  \\n then repair the fence.  \\n Finally, you'll actually paint the fence with your neighbor.  \\n Understanding our customers and their needs  \\n with scrutiny, like the fence painting job,  \\n gives us the ability to prioritize our design work.  \\n Design thinking methods and activities  \\n give us a deep understanding of our customers.  \\n This helps us rank the value of the needs they have  \\n and the solutions we could provide.  \\n That gives us the information we need  \\n to prioritize what we work on to help our customers succeed.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2891345\",\"duration\":138,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Planning\",\"fileName\":\"2875325_02_04_LA30_plan\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how design thinking can help guide and integrate with your organization's planning process.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":30306593,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Planning in a product design organization  \\n of any size and shape can be challenging.  \\n Challenging to be able to paint a picture of a future state  \\n and break those down into tangible steps.  \\n Super challenging to also ensure  \\n that your customers will be happy  \\n with the outcome of those plans.  \\n How might design thinking help with your product planning?  \\n For a moment, let's step away together from product design.  \\n Let's say you decide that you want to build a chicken coop  \\n for your local community garden.  \\n You get the leaders together,  \\n and you start talkin' about budget.  \\n You walk the area together, talking about the size  \\n of the coop that you might be able to fit there.  \\n You start making a list of materials  \\n for a structure of that size and shape.  \\n You schedule some weekends and evenings  \\n for volunteers to get together and construct it.  \\n You identify some folks with construction skills.  \\n All sounds pretty logical, right?
