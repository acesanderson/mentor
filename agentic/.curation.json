 \\n There's actually no way to tell.  \\n This can happen quite often when you're dealing  \\n with multiple people of the same gender,  \\n so watch out for it.  \\n The only way to fix the problem is to rewrite the sentence.  \\n For example, Maria suggested Susan should try a new recipe  \\n or Maria told Susan she's planning to try a new recipe.  \\n We'll talk about pronouns much more,  \\n but for now remember  \\n if you have a sentence with more than one person,  \\n confirm which pronoun you want by testing the pronoun alone,  \\n that possessive pronouns do not take apostrophes,  \\n and make sure your pronouns have clear antecedents.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2702277\",\"duration\":289,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Singular \\\"they\\\"\",\"fileName\":\"4364376_en_US_04_02_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"After watching this video, you'll be able to identify the appropriate times for using \\\"they\\\" as a singular pronoun.

 \\n someone called but they didn't leave a message.  \\n The singular \\\"they\\\" has also become increasingly common  \\n as a pronoun for people who don't identify  \\n as male or female.  \\n When you use the singular \\\"they\\\"  \\n to refer to a non-binary person,  \\n you pair it with a plural verb.  \\n For example, Quinn comes to Aroma every morning.  \\n They are always here when we open.  \\n It's the same way we use a plural verb  \\n for the pronoun \\\"you\\\",  \\n whether it refers to one person or many people.  \\n Shawna, meet me at Aroma tomorrow morning.  \\n You are going to love it.  \\n It's actually not that surprising  \\n that the singular \\\"they\\\" has been gaining acceptance.  \\n In fact, given its history, it's more surprising  \\n that it's taken so long.  \\n People have been using the singular \\\"they\\\" since the 1300s.  \\n And you can find it in the work of such illustrious authors  \\n as Jane Austin, Jeffrey Cser, Charles Dickens,  \\n Henry James, and William Shakespeare.  \\n All the major style guides  \\n now say it's fine to use the singular \\\"they\\\"  \\n at least in some instances.  \\n For example, the Chicago Manual of Style,  \\n Associated Press Style Book,  \\n and the MLA Handbook all say it's fine.  \\n So, if your sentence would be awkward without it, go for it.  \\n However, unless you're writing about someone  \\n who uses they/their pronouns, you may want to avoid it.  \\n Although the singular \\\"they\\\" is much more widely accepted  \\n than it's been in the past,  \\n some people do still object to it or find it distracting.  \\n For example, I did the same survey  \\n of Grammar Girl followers in 2007 and 2023.  \\n In 2007, only 32% of people would use the singular \\\"they\\\"  \\n in a sentence such as, a student should thank their teacher.  \\n But that number had risen all the way to 68% in 2023.  \\n Further, that's the percent of people  \\n who preferred to use \\\"their\\\".  \\n It's quite likely an even larger number wouldn't object,  \\n even if it's not their preference.  \\n It's always a good idea to consider your audience  \\n and their preferences, whether that's your blog readers,  \\n your customers, your boss, or your teachers.  \\n If you do want to rewrite your sentence,  \\n the simplest way is usually to make the subject plural.  \\n For example, a student should thank their teacher  \\n easily becomes, students should thank their teachers.  \\n You can also sometimes replace the pronoun with an article.  \\n For example, someone left their coat on the chair  \\n can become someone left a coat on the chair.  \\n The singular \\\"they\\\" solves the problem  \\n of English not having a formal pronoun in the third person  \\n for a person of unknown or non-binary gender.  \\n It's been used by great writers for hundreds of years  \\n and all the major style guides  \\n now say that it's fine in at least some cases.  \\n However, some people do still find  \\n the singular \\\"they\\\" distracting.  \\n So, if you'd like to rewrite your sentences,  \\n two easy ways are to make your subject plural  \\n and to substitute an article for the pronoun.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4469277\",\"duration\":51,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Demonstrative pronouns\",\"fileName\":\"4364376_en_US_04_03_XR30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"After watching this video, you'll be able to identify demonstrative pronouns and properly make use of them in sentences.

 \\n Various types of wordiness exist.  \\n Let's begin with wordy phrases:  \\n bad disaster,  \\n free gift,  \\n postpone until later,  \\n plan in advance.  \\n Do you recognize why they are all wordy?  \\n We don't have good disasters.  \\n Have you ever been asked to pay for a gift?  \\n Do we postpone to the past  \\n or plan after something is finished?  \\n Listen to this wordy sentence.  \\n The new desk will be red in color, round in shape,  \\n and arrive in the month of July.  \\n The reader will know that red is a color, round is a shape,  \\n and that July is a month.  \\n A more concise version is:  \\n The new red, round desk will arrive in July.  \\n The first version had 18 words.  \\n The revised version has nine words.  \\n Another kind of wordiness is meaningless expressions  \\n and words that you may have heard used repeatedly  \\n and continue to use them without analyzing their wordiness.  \\n Due to the fact that  \\n can always be replaced with one word, because.  \\n Hit your mental delete button  \\n and get rid of that phrase right now.  \\n Feel free, as in, \\\"Feel free to call me,\\\"  \\n has absolutely no meaning.  \\n Use, \\\"Please call if you need more information.\\\"  \\n Other kinds of meaningless phrases  \\n you might be tempted to use include,  \\n \\\"I am writing to inform you.\\\"  \\n Obviously, you are writing.  \\n I have the document in my hand  \\n and that's what communication does, it informs.  \\n \\\"I have received your letter.\\\"  \\n If you hadn't received it, you wouldn't be writing about it.  \\n \\\"You will be pleased to know,\\\"  \\n or, \\\"I am happy to inform you.\\\"  \\n Readers usually aren't concerned  \\n about the writer's emotional state, \\\"I'm happy,\\\"  \\n and don't want the writer to tell them as readers  \\n what their emotional state should be.  \\n \\\"You will be happy.\\\"  \\n Yet another wordy category  \\n is what is sometimes referred to as rubber stamps  \\n or stock phrases.  \\n These are expressions that are used over and over,  \\n and because of their overuse, have lost their effectiveness.  \\n \\\"If you have any further questions,  \\n don't hesitate to contact me.\\\"  \\n Or, \\\"If you have any other questions,  \\n feel free to contact me.\\\"  \\n At first glance, you might think these expressions  \\n are used to be nice to your reader,  \\n but in fact, they can have quite the opposite effect.  \\n It says to your reader that he or she isn't important enough  \\n to think of anything personalized to say.  \\n Sometimes, adding only a word or two  \\n can personalize the message.  \\n \\\"If you have any more questions  \\n about how to care for your new sofa, let us know.\\\"  \\n That's much more personalized.  \\n Wordiness can also result when weak verbs are used.  \\n The verb is the strongest word in the sentence.  \\n Which of these has a stronger sound?  \\n \\\"You will need to send your confirmation  \\n for your appointment by Friday,\\\"  \\n or. \\\"Please confirm your appointment by Friday.\\\"  \\n 12 words reduced to six words.  \\n Not only is the second message stronger, it's more concise.  \\n Look for camouflage verbs when you revise.  \\n Verbs that have been turned into nouns,  \\n usually with a T-I-O-N,  \\n such as confirmation instead of confirm, in the example.  \\n Expletives are fillers.  \\n The indefinite it and there are also in this category  \\n of wordiness creators.  \\n \\\"It has been found that all employees  \\n will be notified about the conference.\\\"  \\n Why not, \\\"All employees  \\n will be notified about the conference.\\\"  \\n 13 words reduced to eight words.  \\n Or, \\\"There are five people  \\n who want to attend the conference.\\\"  \\n Make that more concise.  \\n \\\"Five people want to attend the conference.\\\"  \\n Tell yourself that you're being charged $100  \\n for each word used.  \\n You will be surprised at the number of words  \\n that are on the chopping block.  \\n So why is conciseness important?

 \\n For example, is she receiving information  \\n that will help her do a better job?  \\n Is he receiving promotional materials  \\n that will help him save money?  \\n Visualize that reader and his or her interest, wants, needs,  \\n before beginning to draft your document.  \\n Giving not enough or too much to detail  \\n also needs to be analyzed before beginning that document.  \\n Once that intended reader is in mind,  \\n determine how much detail he needs.  \\n Has she been a part of a previous discussion  \\n about a new policy,  \\n or is he a client who has no knowledge  \\n about why a new policy is being implemented?  \\n The reader needs enough information  \\n to understand the message,  \\n but not so many details  \\n that she gets bogged down in minutia.  \\n Also not thinking about what language to use  \\n can result in using unclear and confusing words.  \\n Is your reader one who works in your department or company  \\n and will understand  \\n the company's specialized technical terms,  \\n or someone for whom more everyday language  \\n will have to be used?  \\n What words will have the same meaning to all readers?  \\n Your message also needs to be planned,  \\n so you don't unintentionally offend the reader.  \\n What tone should be used?  \\n Harsh words result in a harsh tone,  \\n even though that might not be your intent.  \\n You have to give us specific information  \\n before we can give you a definite cost.  \\n The writer probably didn't intend for that to sound harsh,  \\n but the reader could certainly read it  \\n with a defensive attitude.  \\n Simply the writing process includes  \\n prewriting, writing, and revising or rewriting.  \\n Effective business writers revise their documents  \\n about five or six times  \\n before actually sending them.  \\n And spend the majority of the time planning and revising.  \\n If you follow the writing process correctly,  \\n you spend the least amount of time actually writing.  \\n Up to 80% of your time  \\n should be spent in the first and last stages.  \\n 40% planning and 40% revising.  \\n The common business writing mentality  \\n is to get that message composed and sent quickly.  \\n And we think that spending all that time  \\n planning and revising is too time-consuming,  \\n but an ill plan hastily written message  \\n will probably either not get read at all  \\n or will be so confusing  \\n that much time-consuming follow up will be necessary.  \\n You are correct that following the writing process  \\n may slow you down at the beginning,  \\n but the good news is  \\n the more you follow it the easier and faster it becomes.  \\n Think about this analogy.  \\n Trying to write without a plan  \\n or without reviewing what you wrote  \\n is like trying to build a house without a blueprint  \\n and without having a final inspection.  \\n No one would do that.  \\n So why do we try to write  \\n without knowing what direction to go  \\n or what our purpose is or how to arrange our message?  \\n So the most important common business writing error to avoid  \\n is trying to write without planning  \\n and sending the message without revising and rewriting.  \\n If you want a message that is reader focused,  \\n gives just the right amount of detail,  \\n uses clear and specific language,  \\n assures that your reader knows exactly  \\n what your message is about,  \\n and has a positive tone that sounds human,  \\n then you need to think plan, write, and revise in that order  \\n to help you avoid all those common errors.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4309083\",\"duration\":324,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Addressing common grammatical errors\",\"fileName\":\"147532_en_US_02_02_2022Q3_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to identify and avoid the most common grammatical mistakes.

 \\n And even if you do want your writing  \\n to be correct grammatically,  \\n you think there are just too many rules  \\n to go back and learn now.  \\n However, to be a successful business writer,  \\n you have to know what is correct  \\n because your reader will know, will care,  \\n and will form an impression of you based on your correct  \\n or incorrect grammar use.  \\n So let's look at some of the common errors  \\n and how to avoid them.  \\n Pronouns.  \\n I is used as a subject of a sentence  \\n or after a linking verb such as is.  \\n Me is used as an object of a preposition or of action verb.  \\n So what does all that mean?  \\n Let's analyze the following examples.  \\n Which pronoun, I, me, or myself, is correct?  \\n Joan and I, me, or myself would like  \\n to attend the conference.  \\n Give the report to Jeff and I, me, or myself.  \\n The correct choices for those sentences are  \\n Joan and I would like to attend the conference.  \\n I is the subject of the sentence.  \\n Give the report to Jeff and me.  \\n Me is the object of the preposition to.  \\n Myself was not the correct choice for any of the examples  \\n and is frequently misused.  \\n Joan and myself.  \\n Even though it may have a formal sound, it is incorrect.  \\n The only two times correctly to use myself are  \\n as an intensifier, I myself would like to attend,  \\n or as a reflector.  \\n I bought that for myself reflects or refers back to I.  \\n Let's look next at possessive case pronouns,  \\n specifically the I-T-S.  \\n As we look at these two examples,  \\n remember that the I-T-S shows possession  \\n and the I-T apostrophe S is the contraction for it is.  \\n The committee will give its report.  \\n The news reporters said it's going to be a packed crowd.  \\n The committee will give I-T-S report,  \\n the report belonging to the committee, possession.  \\n The news reporter said I-T apostrophe S going  \\n to be a packed crowd.  \\n Replace I-T apostrophe S with it is.  \\n Why is I-T-S apostrophe not the correct choice in either?  \\n For a simple reason.  \\n There is no correct use of I-T-S apostrophe,  \\n so get that out of your choices forever.  \\n Both adjectives and adverbs are used to describe, modify,  \\n or tell more about.  \\n The adverbs are the ones that are likely to be misused.  \\n For example, I feel badly that you didn't win the award.  \\n Is that correct?  \\n Would you say I feel sadly or gladly or madly?  \\n Probably not, so why badly?  \\n I feel bad that you didn't win the award is correct,  \\n not badly.  \\n But he played the game badly is correct.  \\n How do you know when to use each?  \\n It's all about that verb.  \\n Is the verb action or linking?  \\n Action verbs show action, played in the example.  \\n Linking verbs are state of being verbs,  \\n I am, he is, they are.  \\n No action is being done.  \\n You can be happy or sad or glad, but there is no action.  \\n So the basic rule is that adverbs  \\n such as badly describe action verbs,  \\n and adjectives such as bad follow linking verbs.  \\n Good and well can also cause problems.  \\n I played the game well.  \\n An adverb that describes how I played the game.  \\n But he has a good score, adjective that describes the score.  \\n Here's the one exception.  \\n When you're describing the condition of your health,  \\n well is correct.  \\n I don't feel well.  \\n Another potential problem area.  \\n Words that sound identical or similar  \\n but are spelled differently cause wrong word choices,  \\n there, T-H-E-R-E, and their, T-H-E-I-R.  \\n There, T-H-E-R-E, means place.  \\n T-H-E-I-R is the possessive case pronoun.  \\n Over there, the place, is their house, belonging to them.  \\n Then and than.  \\n T-H-E-N is a time word.  \\n T-H-A-N is a comparison word.  \\n Her income is higher than mine, comparing.  \\n Right then, at that time, I decided to ask for a raise.  \\n Affect and effect.  \\n A-F-F-E-C-T is the verb.  \\n E-F-F-E-C-T is the noun.  \\n We were affected, showing action,  \\n by the effects, results, of the new policy.  \\n Accept and except.  \\n A-C-C-E-P-T is the verb.  \\n E-X-C-E-P-T is a preposition.  \\n Everyone accepted, agreed to,  \\n the new rules except, the lone dissenter, Frank.  \\n So next time you aren't certain which pronoun to use  \\n or which similar-sounding word is correct,  \\n just remember that someone will know, will notice,  \\n and will form an impression of the writer.  \\n You want that impression to be a good one,  \\n so take the time to review or learn how to apply the rules.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4310094\",\"duration\":285,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Addressing common punctuation errors\",\"fileName\":\"147532_en_US_02_03_2022Q3_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to correctly use commas, colons, apostrophes, and more.

 \\n The comma is the most used  \\n and the most abused punctuation mark.  \\n I'm convinced that sometimes  \\n the only reason a comma is inserted  \\n is that it looked like a good place, or I breathe,  \\n or I haven't used one for a while.  \\n However, that comma can completely change  \\n the meaning of your message.  \\n Look at this sentence.  \\n Does it need a comma?

 \\n This one's easy.  \\n The period and the comma  \\n are always placed inside the quote marks.  \\n The colon and semicolon  \\n are always placed outside the quote marks.  \\n Quote, learn to anticipate our customers' wants and needs,  \\n comma, quote,  \\n is the quote on the front of our store.  \\n The quote on the front of our store is, comma, quote,  \\n learn to anticipate our customers' wants and needs, period,  \\n quotation marks.  \\n See the placement of the comma and period?

 \\n A good guideline to follow is this,  \\n if you wouldn't want to see  \\n the message posted on the company bulletin board  \\n the next morning, don't send it.  \\n In other words, it isn't confidential.  \\n Equally important to remember is  \\n that it is much more permanent than we might think.  \\n Hitting that delete button does not  \\n mean the message is gone.  \\n It can be retrieved and frequently is.  \\n Also consider the ease with which a message can be forwarded  \\n without the sender's knowledge or permission.  \\n Now think about when you open your email,  \\n how do you decide which message you will read?  \\n If you're like most people, you look at the sender's name  \\n and then at the subject line.  \\n If you don't know the sender  \\n and no subject line or an incomplete one is given,  \\n you probably delete the message.  \\n So the subject line is crucial in determining  \\n if a message will be read.  \\n Which of the following would be an effective subject line,  \\n Procedure, job procedure, advertisement procedure,  \\n new job advertisement procedure to fill openings faster?  \\n Obviously, just the one word procedure  \\n could be one of many in the company,  \\n or chances are when the reader saw  \\n job or advertisement procedure, he might say,  \\n I know what the job advertisement procedure is,  \\n and not read the email.  \\n See how important the words new  \\n and to fill openings faster are?  \\n Or what about that email message  \\n that replies to a reply to a reply,  \\n or is forwarded FYI and contains a series of messages?  \\n Here's an actual example of an email series  \\n that resulted in, well, you decide what the problem is.  \\n This series is between my support staff person  \\n and the computer department after  \\n I sent the department support person this message.  \\n It sounded polite and innocent to me.  \\n \\\"Could I please get a permanent mobile cart  \\n \\\"assigned to room 417?  \\n \\\"Thanks.\\\"  \\n But here's what happened next.  \\n My support staff sent a message to the tech department,  \\n \\\"Do you assign mobile carts to the classroom?  \\n \\\"Judy has requested to have one assigned to room 417.\\\"  \\n Tech replied, \\\"This isn't our classroom.  \\n \\\"It's a UITS classroom.  \\n \\\"There should be one in the room,  \\n \\\"but you might have her double-check.\\\"  \\n My support staff to me,  \\n \\\"Judy, you might want to double-check the room  \\n \\\"and if, in fact, you do not have an overhead,  \\n \\\"I'll check with UITS.\\\"  \\n My response,  \\n \\\"I'm 100% certain that there wasn't one there today,  \\n \\\"at least not before I left at 12:30.\\\"  \\n Support staff to tech department,  \\n \\\"Could we please find out why there is not a mobile cart  \\n \\\"in room 417 as there should be.  \\n \\\"Judy is upset that one isn't available.\\\"  \\n Do you think I sounded upset in my previous message?  \\n I immediately personally sent a message explaining why  \\n I needed the cart on a permanent basis,  \\n that I understood there aren't enough carts for every room,  \\n and that I wasn't upset.  \\n Hindsight, I should have walked down one floor  \\n and asked directly face to face.  \\n Too much time was wasted sending that series of emails.  \\n Another takeaway from that example  \\n is that the writer's tone does not convey well in emails.  \\n So although email is quick,  \\n and the reader has access to it any time,  \\n the writer does have to consider  \\n if email is the correct channel,  \\n especially if it contains confidential information.  \\n The writer needs to ensure that the subject line is clear,  \\n so that the reader immediately knows the message's purpose.  \\n And finally, the message should have a courteous tone.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4308098\",\"duration\":257,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Special considerations for reports\",\"fileName\":\"147532_en_US_02_05_2022Q3_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Reports have unique characteristics that must be considered.

 \\n In business, a careful analysis of facts  \\n and well-supported assumptions persuade,  \\n not opinions or general statements.  \\n Using superlatives and emotional words,  \\n such as greatest ever and wonderful opportunity,  \\n should be avoided.  \\n Specific facts should do the persuading,  \\n not, \\\"This will make lots of money,\\\"  \\n but, \\\"We can mark up this item 120%.\\\"  \\n How often is the report prepared?  \\n Periodically, on a regular basis,  \\n once a month, or once a year, for example?  \\n Or is it a special report?  \\n Maybe a month into the latest campaign.  \\n Management wants to be updated  \\n on the progress of the campaign,  \\n both what is going well and what is not.  \\n Is the reader inside or outside the company,  \\n and what formality level does that reader expect  \\n and what jargon can be used?  \\n Short one or two-page internal memo reports  \\n are more likely to be informal,  \\n meaning that first-person pronouns will be used.  \\n Long, manuscript-type external reports  \\n are more likely to be formal.  \\n No first person, such as I or we,  \\n or second person, such as you or your pronouns.  \\n No contractions and more passive voice  \\n because the focus is on the content  \\n rather than on who wrote the report.  \\n An example of active and passive would be,  \\n \\\"I found when I researched...\\\" is active.  \\n The focus is on the writer.  \\n \\\"The research showed...\\\" is passive,  \\n more focused on the actual report's content.  \\n What parts should the report have?  \\n The longer the report,  \\n the more likely it will have a title page,  \\n a table of contents to guide the reader,  \\n a letter to the reader to transmit the report,  \\n and visual aids.  \\n Should the report use the direct, deductive arrangement  \\n or the indirect, inductive arrangement?  \\n That decision is also partially made based on the reader.  \\n If you think your reader will be receptive to your idea  \\n and has been involved in the entire process,  \\n then you'll probably want to be direct.  \\n Begin with the purpose.  \\n For example, in a recommendation report,  \\n you would begin with a recommendation.  \\n Analyze if your reader  \\n might be skeptical or hostile, however,  \\n and has little knowledge of what the report's purpose is.  \\n If that's the situation,  \\n then you are more likely to have to prepare your reader  \\n by introducing him  \\n to the report's purpose with background information  \\n and support for your recommendation  \\n before actually recommending.  \\n Regardless of the reader, the formality, the type,  \\n or purpose of the report,  \\n all reports need to use lists  \\n for information that you want to be sure your reader sees,  \\n include transition between the main ideas,  \\n use language your reader understands,  \\n and be reader-friendly  \\n with descriptive internal headings, such as the following.  \\n The heading previews for the reader  \\n what the section is about.  \\n 10% workforce reduction projected.  \\n Northwest stores will be affected most.  \\n Southeast stores will give early retirement.  \\n Reports, in one sense,  \\n are just like any other writing you do for business.  \\n You must apply all the principles  \\n of effective business writing,  \\n but in addition they have unique characteristics  \\n that must be considered.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4312087\",\"duration\":199,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Special considerations for memos\",\"fileName\":\"147532_en_US_02_06_2022Q3_XR15\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, explore the unique opportunities a memo presents.

 \\n Chances are you eagerly open  \\n the handwritten envelopes first.  \\n In this age of electronic communication,  \\n the handwritten note is viewed as personal,  \\n special, memorable, and appreciated.  \\n In what types of situations  \\n is the handwritten note appropriate?  \\n Maybe to show your gratitude to that client  \\n who called your boss to compliment you  \\n on how you handled a situation,  \\n or to follow up after the first meeting  \\n with a potential customer.  \\n Perhaps to congratulate a coworker  \\n on his or her promotion,  \\n or to thank that person who took the time  \\n to interview you,  \\n or to express your condolences to your subordinate  \\n for the death in her family.  \\n That handwritten note could also be sent  \\n to show thoughtfulness when someone  \\n is going through a private difficult time.  \\n Whatever the occasion, whether a happy or sad time,  \\n the handwritten note is viewed as something special.  \\n Why?  \\n Because they are sent so infrequently.  \\n We feel more comfortable at texting, tweeting,  \\n Skyping, and typing.  \\n Those methods, as valuable as they are,  \\n can't replace the treasured handwritten note.  \\n So if the handwritten note stands out  \\n among messages and is so appreciated,  \\n why do we not send them more often?  \\n We may feel uncomfortable sending one for various reasons.  \\n My penmanship is illegible,  \\n or I can't keep straight lines.  \\n Maybe I don't know what stationary to use,  \\n or what if I'm not sure I'll say the right thing.  \\n If you've ever made any of those comments  \\n you are correct that the message  \\n does need to have a nice appearance  \\n and that words should be sincere.  \\n You can beat competitors in attracting new business  \\n or in keeping current customers.  \\n Clients like to be reminded  \\n that you appreciate their business  \\n and they feel special when you take the time  \\n to hand write them a personal thank you note.  \\n It says that their business is important to you.  \\n A handwritten note will also make you stand out  \\n after a job interview.  \\n Sending an email thank you  \\n which may get lost in the sheer number of email messages  \\n in a busy person's inbox,  \\n and a handwritten thank you note  \\n will make you memorable  \\n because you took time for that extra personal step.  \\n Handwritten notes will also help you  \\n build stronger relationships with coworkers,  \\n subordinates, superiors, and clients or customers.  \\n We hear a lot about the importance  \\n of having a high EQ or emotional quotient,  \\n which has a lot to do with our people skills  \\n and our relationships.  \\n People with high EQs are more likely to realize  \\n the importance of sending handwritten notes  \\n in developing strong relationships.  \\n So how should you go about writing  \\n that personalized note?  \\n First, give what you want to say some thought.  \\n It doesn't have to be long.  \\n Three or four well-thought through sentences may be enough.  \\n Second, the occasional handwritten notes  \\n supplements the phone calls, the emails,  \\n and even that text message  \\n that keep you and your product  \\n and services in your client or customer's mind.  \\n Some companies require their employees  \\n to send personalized notes after meeting  \\n with each new contact.  \\n Third, make it timely.  \\n The rule of thumb for sending  \\n a handwritten thank you note  \\n after an interview, for example, is within 24 hours.  \\n Like anything else, the longer we put it off,  \\n the less likely we are to do it.  \\n Even if the interview did not go well,  \\n someone took the time to interview you  \\n and deserves to be thanked.  \\n No matter how impressive your credentials,  \\n that you sent a handwritten note  \\n will be even more memorable.  \\n So don't be afraid of writing that old-fashioned note.  \\n Whatever the situation or the occasion,  \\n the time you spend writing them  \\n will be time well-spent when you get return  \\n or new business, increase positive word of mouth comments,  \\n and build stronger relationships in your work environment.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4315136\",\"duration\":129,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Noticing the difference\",\"fileName\":\"147532_en_US_02_08_2022Q3_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":4580798,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - [Narrator] Old habits can be hard to break,  \\n but you now understand how important being an effective  \\n business writer is to your career.  \\n You also know the techniques to use  \\n that will get you noticed as an effective business writer.  \\n So you must continue following the writing process,  \\n and practicing those techniques to hone your skills.  \\n Remember that four fifths  \\n of your time should be spent planning and revising.  \\n Trying to remember everything to incorporate and checking  \\n to see if all the guidelines were followed  \\n can be time consuming.  \\n However, the good news is that eventually clear,  \\n concise, complete, and considerate, correct,  \\n courteous, credible, conversational, coherent,  \\n and concrete writing will become your default setting.  \\n You will be able to apply those techniques  \\n to letters, reports, emails, memos,  \\n any type of business document you have to compose.  \\n Keep telling yourself that a natural born writer is a myth.  \\n Those writers you admire and envy,  \\n well the truth is they usually draft five  \\n or six times before they're satisfied  \\n with the version you see.  \\n So what next steps will you take to become  \\n that mythical natural born writer?

held,\\nwhere it had always been held, but Corey,\\nhaving never attended one of these meetings,\\nneeded that crucial bit of information.\\n\\nSo the major cause of incomplete writing\\nis assuming or forgetting to analyze what\\nyour reader does and doesn't know.\\nWhat can be done to be certain\\nyour communication is complete?\\nTry to think like your reader.\\nEven though that can be difficult, the more\\nyou know and can learn about your reader\\nthe more you can try to think like that reader.\\nAsk yourself these questions.\\nWhat is the primary purpose of the message?\\nThe most important point I need\\nmy reader to remember?\\nWhat information must the message include?\\nFor example, ask the questions who, what,\\nwhen, where, why, and how.\\n\\nWhat does the audience already know\\nabout this situation?\\nWill my reader need some background information\\nor has he been part of all previous\\ndiscussions or negotiations?\\nWhat does my reader want to know\\nand/or need to know?\\nHow does the information impact the reader?\\nWhat should the reader do with the information?\\nAdditionally, what actions do you want\\nfrom the reader?\\nIs a follow-up necessary or is the message\\njust to provide information?\\nIf follow-up is necessary, how is it to be shared,\\ncall a meeting, send an e-mail, or write a report?\\nAlso ask if you've worked with this reader before.\\n\\nDo we have a working relationship so I know\\nhow the reader will react to the message?\\nWill the reader have a positive, neutral,\\nor negative reaction?\\nTo help you analyze if your message is complete,\\nyou might have someone who is unfamiliar\\nwith the situation read your message to see\\nif he or she has any questions about\\nwhat you are saying.\\nIf possible, write your message and then put\\nit aside for even 10 or 15 minutes\\nand then re-read it to help you identify holes\\nin the message.\\n\\nKeep trying to see the message\\nthrough your reader's eyes, and ask those\\nall-important questions so that you can\\nbe certain the message is

CEOs often tell their employees\\nthat they will read only one page.\\nIf you have only one page to give your entire message,\\neach word has to count, however, a disclaimer before\\nwe begin, one or two extra words will not necessarily\\nturn good writing into awful writing.\\nHowever, people who are wordy tend not to limit wordiness\\nto a word or two here or there.\\nThat three-page memo that won't get read can be reduced\\nto a one-page memo that will be read.\\n\\nThe first step in applying the principles\\nof effective business writing is to understand\\nthe principle, so what exactly is wordiness?\\nVarious types of wordiness exist.\\nLet's begin with wordy phrases.\\nDo you recognize why they are all wordy?\\nWe don't have good disasters.\\nHave you ever been asked to pay for a gift, do we postpone\\nto the past or plan after something is finished?\\nListen to this wordy sentence.\\n\\nThe reader will know that red is a color,\\nround is a shape, and that July is a month.\\nA more concise version is:\\nThe first version had 18 words.\\nThe revised version has nine words.\\nAnother kind of wordiness is meaningless expressions\\nand words that you may have heard used repeatedly\\nand continue to use them without analyzing their wordiness.\\nDue to the fact that can always be replaced\\nwith one word, because, hit your mental delete button\\nand get rid of that phrase right now.\\n\\nFeel free, as in feel free to call me, has absolutely\\nno meaning, use please call if you need more information.\\nOther kinds of meaningless phrases you might be tempted\\nto use include I am writing to inform you, obviously you are\\nwriting, I have the document in my hand, and that's\\nwhat communication does, it informs.\\nI have received your letter, if you hadn't received it,\\nyou wouldn't be writing about it.\\nYou will be pleased to know or I am happy to inform you,\\nreaders usually aren't concerned about the writer's\\nemotional state, I am happy, and don't want the writer\\nto tell them as readers what their emotional\\nstate should be, you will be happy.\\n\\nYet another wordy category is what is sometimes\\nreferred to as rubber stamps or stock phrases.\\nThese are expressions that are used over and over\\nand because of their overuse have lost their effectiveness.\\nYou've probably used these and seen these used\\nmultiple times.\\nAt first glance you might think that these expressions\\nare used to be nice to your reader,\\nbut in fact they can have quite the opposite effect.\\n\\nIt says to your reader that he or she isn't important enough\\nto think of anything personalized to say.\\nSometimes adding only a word or two can personalize\\nthe message, if you have any more questions about\\nhow to care for your new sofa, let us know.\\nThat's much more personalized.\\nWordiness can also result when weak verbs are used.\\nThe verb is the strongest word in the sentence.\\nWhich of these has a stronger sound?\\n12 words reduced to six words.\\n\\nNot only is the second message stronger, it's more concise.\\nLook for camouflage verbs when you revise, verbs that\\nhave been turned into nouns usually with a T, I, O, N,\\nsuch as confirmation instead of confirm in the example.\\nExpletives or fillers, the indefinite it and their are\\nalso in this category of wordiness creators.\\nWhy not all employees will be notified about the conference?\\n13 words reduced to eight words.\\n\\nMake that more concise.\\nThat's a four word reduction.\\nSee the difference, hear the difference.\\nTell yourself that you are being charged 100 dollars\\nfor each word used, you will be surprised at the number\\nor words that are on the chopping block.\\nSo why is conciseness important?\\nYour reader is busy and your message will compete\\nwith dozens of other messages for the reader's attention.\\nConcise wording results in fewer words for that busy reader.\\n\\nReaders appreciate writing that says what needs to be said\\nin the fewest number of words possible.\\nConcise writing is a time saver for your reader\\nand will help ensure that your entire message is read.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:162419\",\"duration\":268,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Making your writing

say it,\\nbut you still just gave a binding 1.4 million dollar bid.\\nFinally, make sure your format is correct.\\nFor example, does the letter look like a letter?\\nDoes it use a modern format,\\nor the old fashioned format with indented paragraphs?\\nHere's an example of a letter that is left justified.\\n\\nAll lines begin at the left margin.\\nThe letter itself explains the parts and the purpose,\\nbut here's an overview.\\nMost companies have a preprinted letterhead\\nwhich will include the company name,\\ncontact information, and maybe a slogan or logo.\\nNext, the date will be given, followed by\\ntwo to four blank lines.\\nThen, the reader's name, title and address.\\nA double space below the inside draft\\nis the reader's courtesy title, Mr., Ms., or Dr.,\\nfollowed by the last name.\\n\\nA colon is used after the names in business letters.\\nA comma is generally used for personal letters.\\nAnother double space, and then use a subject line.\\nAlthough a subject line in this letter style\\nisn't required, it helps the reader immediately\\nidentify the purpose of the letter.\\nThe actual body of the letter is then given.\\nIf the letter is more than one page,\\neach additional page needs a continuation\\nheading that includes the reader's name,\\nthe page number, and the date.\\n\\nA double space below the last line of\\nthe letter's body is the complimentary close.\\nSincerely and cordially are the most frequently used.\\nVery truly yours is an old style\\nthat is rarely used today.\\nThen leave three blank lines for the writer's signature.\\nThe only other ending parts might be the\\nreference initials.\\nThose are used if someone other than the person\\nwho wrote the letter actually types it.\\nIf you've mentioned in the letter that\\nsomething is enclosed,\\nthen an enclosure notation is used,\\nand finally, the names of others who\\nmight have received a copy of the letter are listed.\\n\\nSo correct names, title,

The courtesy is one of the most complex\\nbusiness-writing concepts with much psychological impact.\\nThe two prongs of courteous writing are\\nwriting with a positive tone,\\nand writing from your reader's viewpoint.\\nLet's first discuss the importance of having a positive tone\\nand how to achieve it.\\nA positive tone results from positive words.\\nNegative words often referred to as red flag words\\ncauses to have negative reactions.\\nNegative words come in a variety of categories.\\n\\nThe obvious \\\"no\\\" or \\\"not\\\" words.\\nThe negative connotation words.\\nReminders of the negative situation.\\nPreachy words and doubtful words.\\nThink how you react when someone says to you,\\n\\\"You can't.\\\"\\n\\\"You failed.\\\"\\nHuman nature is such that we immediately become defensive\\nand reply with something such as,\\n\\\"Well, it wasn't my fault.\\\"\\n\\\"No one told me.\\\"\\nOr \\\"You didn't make it clear what you wanted.\\\"\\nHere's an example.\\n\\nThe first thing someone says to you\\nwhen you arrived to work is\\n\\\"You forgot to turn off the lights last night\\\"\\n\\\"before you left.\\\"\\nMaybe you're a kinder person than I am\\nand might respond with,\\n\\\"Thank you for reminding me.\\\"\\n\\\"I'll try to do better next time.\\\"\\nMy response would probably be,\\n\\\"Everyone expects me to do everything,\\\"\\nor \\\"That's not in my job description.\\\"\\nIf you can keep out all or at least most of the negatives,\\nthen you reduce your reader's resistance.\\nFocus on what is or can be\\nrather than on what isn't or can't be.\\n\\nThat's sort of like the glass is half full\\nor half empty analogy.\\nDo you see the differences in these sentences?\\nYou won't get your supplies until Friday.\\nYou will receive your supplies on Friday.\\nOr you can't reserve Room 111 on June 10\\nwhich is negative.\\nBut Room 111 is already reserve for June 10\\nbut it is available on June 9 or 11.\\nThat revision has a positive tone.\\nOr we can't allow you a refund after 30 days.\\n\\nIt can be revised to have a positive tone to\\nyour item is eligible for a refund for 30 days.\\nThese no are not words or obviously negative\\nand usually are easy to identify.\\nHowever, negatives come in a variety of other categories.\\nLet's look at the next kind of negatives.\\nSuperior words.\\nThese words have negative connotations.\\nGrant, permit, and allow.\\nIf you are in a higher level position,\\nyou usually allow or permit someone in a lower position\\nto do something.\\n\\nIf you tell a customer,\\nwe will permit or allow you to return\\nthe item for replacement.\\nThe customer is likely to hear a condescending tone.\\nWriting, \\\"Please return your item for a replacement,\\\"\\neliminates that tone.\\nThe next type of negative words are reminders\\nof a negative situation.\\nWriting about the problem,\\nthe inconvenience, the broken part,\\nthose all remind the reader of the negative.\\nLook at the negative focus in these sentences.\\n\\nThe broken computer you sent is now repaired.\\nWe are sorry for the inconvenience.\\nBroken and inconvenience are the words the reader sees.\\nYou want your reader focusing\\non the repair and the solution.\\nYour repaired computer will be delivered tomorrow.\\nOr a new process will help you get faster service.\\nPreachy words also cause us to become defensive.\\nYou must fill out this form\\nif you want to enroll in the program.\\n\\nChange the preachy tone to\\nplease fill out the form\\nso that you will be enrolled in the program.\\nYou have to have your receipt before you get a refund.\\nOr please show your receipt to get a full refund.\\nFinally, we have doubtful or uncertain words.\\nHope and if can also be negative words\\nwhen used to show that you aren't certain\\nyou've satisfied the reader that he will return.\\nI hope I've satisfied you.\\nHere is a 20% off coupon\\nif you ever do business with us again.\\n\\nWriting, \\\"You will receive your requested replacement.\\\"\\nOr here is a 20% off coupon to use\\nthe next time you're in the store.\\nRemove the doubt and the uncertainty.\\nUsing positive language to give negative information\\ntakes more thought but is possible and worthy effort.\\nThe second part of courteous writing is called\\nreader benefit or you viewpoint.\\nAlways ask yourself what the reader gets\\nrather than focusing on what you, the writer, are giving\\nor your emotional state.\\n\\nPut yourself in your reader's position.\\nTry to think like that reader.\\nHow would you react if you receive that message?\\nLook at this sentence.\\nI'm happy to inform you\\nthat we are giving you a $10 discount.\\nThe writer is telling the reader how she feels rather\\nthan giving the reader the news that she really wants.\\nHere's another example.\\nWe have had to raise our prices because we've had\\na decline in profits and can't continue to lose money.\\nThe writer's only concern in that sentence\\nis that our company continue to make money.\\n\\nLet's rephrase those sentences\\nto focus on the reader's interests.\\nYou will receive a $10 discount.\\nSo that you may continue to receive high-quality service,\\nthe minimum charge on your account is now $10.\\nCourteous writing means using a positive tone\\nand focusing on reader's benefits.\\nHuman nature is that we all want to know what's in it for me.\\nWe want a tone that doesn't cost us\\nto become defensive or insulted.\\nWriting courteously is a win-win situation.\\n\\nThe writer makes the reader

planning stage, you want to get\\na clear idea of your reader.\\nHow does a reader benefit from the message?\\nFor example, is she receiving information\\nthat will help her do a better job?\\nIs he receiving promotional materials\\nthat will help him save money?\\nVisualize that reader and his or her interest, wants,\\nneeds before beginning to draft your document.\\n\\nAnother area to consider before writing is,\\nare you leaving the reader bewildered\\nabout the purpose of the intended message?\\nOr in other words, ask yourself,\\nwhy am I writing this?\\nDo I want to give my reader new information\\nto help her understand a new policy\\nor to take action?\\nGiving not enough or too much detail\\nalso needs to be analyzed\\nbefore beginning that document.\\nOnce that intended reader is in mind,\\ndetermine how much detail he needs.\\nHas she been a part of a previous discussion\\nabout a new policy?\\nOr is he a client who has no knowledge\\nabout why a new policy is being implemented?\\nThe reader needs enough information\\nto understand the message\\nbut not so many details\\nthat she gets bogged down by new minutiae.\\n\\nAlso not thinking about what language to use\\ncan result in using unclear and confusing words.\\nIs your reader one who works in your department\\nor company and will understand the company\\nspecialized technical terms?\\nOr someone for whom more everyday language\\nwill have to be used?\\nWhat words will have the same meaning\\nto all readers?\\nFor example, you have several days\\nto complete this form\\nor you have four days to complete this form.\\nSeveral is vague but four is specific.\\n\\nYour message also needs to be planned\\nso you don't unintentionally offend the reader.\\nWhat tone should be used?\\nHarsh words

sound harsh but the reader could certainly\\nread it with a defensive attitude.\\nSimply the writing process includes prewriting,\\nwriting and revising or rewriting.\\nEffective business writers revise their documents\\nabout five or six times before actually sending them\\nand spend the majority of the time,\\nplanning and revising.\\n\\nIf you follow the writing process correctly,\\nyou spend the least amount of time\\nactually writing.\\nUp to 80% of your time should be spent in the first\\nand last stages.\\n40% planning and 40% revising.\\nThe common business writing

message\\nwill probably either not get read at all\\nor will be so confusing\\nthat much time consuming follow up\\nwill be necessary.\\n\\nYou are correct that following the writing process\\nmay slow you down at the beginning\\nbut the good news is, the more you follow it,\\nthe easier and faster it becomes.\\nThink about this analogy.\\nTrying to write without a plan\\nor without reviewing what you wrote\\nis like trying to build a house\\nwithout a blueprint and without having\\na final inspection.\\nThe lands purchase, the workers, the equipments\\nand supplies are on site\\nbut no

know,\\nwill care, and will form an impression\\nof you based on your correct\\nor incorrect grammar use.\\n\\nMemorizing the rule is not the same\\nas being able to use the rule.\\nSo, let's look at some of the\\ncommon errors and how to avoid them.\\nPronouns in which case to use\\nobjective or subjective?\\nWhen to use I, me, or myself?\\nI is used as the subject of a sentence\\nor after a linking verb such as is.\\nMe is used as an object of\\na preposition or an action verb.\\nSo what does all that mean?\\nLet's analyze the following examples.\\nWhich pronoun I, me, or myself is correct?\\nJoan and I, me, or myself would\\nlike to attend the conference.\\n\\nGive the report to Jeff and I, me, or myself.\\nShe can run as fast as I, me, or myself.\\nIt's I, me, or myself such as when\\nyou'd be answering the phone.\\nThe correct choices for those sentences are:\\nJoan and I would like to attend the conference.\\nI is the subject of the sentence.\\nGive the report to Jeff and me.\\nMe is the object of the preposition to.\\nShe can run as fast as I.\\nAgain a subject is needed to the\\nunderstood verb, as I can.\\n\\nYou wouldn't say as fast as me can.\\nIt's I, is is the linking verb.\\nMyself was not the correct choice for any\\nof the examples and is frequently misused.\\nJoan and myself, even though it may have\\na formal sound, it is incorrect.\\nThe only two times correctly to use myself\\nare as intensifier, I myself would like to attend,\\nor as a reflector, I bought that for myself,\\nreflects or refers back to I.\\n\\nLet's look next at possessive case pronouns,\\nspecifically the its, as we look at these two examples,\\nremember that the its shows possession\\nand the it's is the contraction for it is.\\nThe committee will give its report.\\nThe news reporters said it's\\ngoing to be a packed crowd.\\nWhen those are read aloud they all sound the same.\\nThey are homonyms which means they sound\\nalike but are different when they're written.\\nThe committee will give i-t-s report.\\n\\nThe report belonging to the committee, possession.\\nThe news reporters said i-t-'-s\\ngoing to be a packed crowd.\\nReplace i-t-'-s with it is.\\nWhy is i-t-s-' not the correct choice in either?\\nFor a simple reason, there is no correct use of its'.\\nSo, get that out of your choices forever.\\nAnother common pronoun error is\\ncalled agreement of number.\\nonly two numbers are possible, singular and plural.\\n\\nIs this sentence correct?\\nEveryone knows their position on the committee.\\nIf you said yes you have violated\\nthe agreement of number rule.\\nEveryone is singular, along with anyone,\\nno one, nobody, each, those are all singular\\nand their is plural.\\nThe pronouns don't agree because\\none is singular and one is plural.\\nIt needs to be revised.\\nEveryone knows his or her position on the committee.\\nOr all participants know their\\npositions on the committee.\\n\\nBoth pronouns are singular in the first revision,\\nand both are plural and the second one.\\nNow, onto adjectives and adverbs.\\nWhen to use each form,\\nbad versus badly for example,\\nboth adjectives and adverbs are used\\nto describe, modify, or tell more about.\\nNormally we use adjectives correctly.\\nThe adverbs are the ones that\\nare likely to be misused.\\nFor example, I feel badly that\\nyou didn't win the award.\\nIs that correct?\\nWould you say I feel sadly or gladly or madly?\\nProbably not, so why badly?\\nI feel bad that you didn't win\\nthe award is correct, not badly.\\n\\nBut, he played the game badly is correct.\\nHow do you know when to use each?\\nIt's all about that verb.\\nIs the verb action or linking?\\nAction verbs show action, played in the example.\\nLinking verbs or state of being verbs, I am,\\nhe is, they are, no action is being done.\\nYou can be happy or sad or glad,\\nbut there is no action.\\nSo, the basic rule is that adverbs\\nsuch as badly, describe action verbs\\nand adjectives such as bad, follow linking verbs.\\n\\nGood and well can also cause problems.\\nI played the game well.\\nAn adjective that describes how I played the game.\\nBut, he has a good score.\\nAdjective that describes the score.\\nHere's the one exception when you are describing\\nthe condition of your health well is correct.\\nI don't feel well.\\nAnother potential problem area, words that sound\\nidentical or similar but are spelled differently\\ncause wrong word choices.\\n\\nThere t-h-e-r-e and their t-h-e-i-r.\\nThere t-h-e-r-e means place,\\nt-h-e-i-r is the possessive case pronoun.\\nOver there the place is their house belonging to them.\\nThen and than, t-h-e-n is a time word,\\nt-h-a-n is a comparison word.\\nHer income is higher than mine, comparing.\\n\\nRight then, at that time, I decided to ask for a raise.\\nAffect and effect.\\nA-f-f-e-c-t is the verb, e-f-f-e-c-t is the noun.\\nWe were affected, showing action.\\nBy the effects, results of the new policy.\\nAccept and except,\\na-c-c-e-p-t is the verb,\\ne-x-c-e-p-t is a preposition.\\nEveryone accepted, agreed to, the new rules\\nexcept the lone dissenter, Frank.\\n\\nSo, next time you aren't certain which pronoun\\nto use or which similar sounding word is correct,\\njust remember that someone will know\\nwill notice, and will form an impression of the writer.\\nYou want that impression to be a good one.\\nSo,take the time to review\\nor learn how to apply the rules.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:162431\",\"duration\":301,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Addressing common punctuation

certainly has advantages and disadvantages.\\nWe need to understand how to use it\\nas a serious business communication channel.\\nAs you're writing email, consider these questions.\\nIs email the best method for this message?\\nHow confidential is the content in the message?\\nIs your subject line clear so the reader\\nwill actually read the email?\\nWill your reader pick up your intended tone?\\nSo first, be sure to analyze if the message\\nreally needs to be sent, or would face-to-face\\nor a phone call be a better channel choice.\\n\\nIf the answer is yes, email is the best channel,\\nthen the same thought and care need to go into\\npreparing email messages as would go into\\na message being sent any other way.\\nOne big paragraph, elementary writing style,\\n\\\"Hey, my name's Sue and BTW I'm an employee\\n\\\"at MXY company and we're just wondering if you\\n\\\"have any information to send up ASAP on TRS\\n\\\"systems that we are considering adding and\\n\\\"if so Txs in advance.\\\"\\nWhat was the person thinking,\\nor apparently not thinking,\\nwhen sending that message?\\nThis message gives a much more professional\\nimage of the sender.\\n\\nSubject line, \\\"Inquiry about TRS Systems.\\\"\\n\\\"Please send us all available information on the\\n\\\"TRS Systems by the end of the month.\\n\\\"Our committee is considering adding\\n\\\"this system to our company.\\n\\\"Thanks.\\\"\\nThe next concern is how confidential is email.\\nA good guideline to follow is this.\\nIf you wouldn't want to see the message\\nposted on the company\\nbulletin board the next morning,\\ndon't send it.\\nIn other words, it isn't confidential.\\nEqually important to remember is that it's much\\nmore permanent than we might think.\\n\\nHitting that delete button does not mean\\nthe message is gone.\\nIt can be retrieved, and frequently is.\\nAlso consider the ease with which messages\\ncan be forwarded, without the sender's\\nknowledge or permission.\\nOr have you ever thought about how easy it is\\nto write a message in haste or in anger,\\nand with a knee jerk reaction,\\nhit the send button, only to calm down 30\\nminutes later and wish you hadn't sent it?\\nThen think about who can view your messages.\\nOne recent study indicated that 75% of companies\\nmonitor their employee's email, and in very few\\nstates does the company have to tell the\\nemployees that they're being monitored.\\n\\nNow think about when you open your email,\\nhow do you decide which message you will read?\\nIf you're like most people, you look at the sender's\\nname, and then at the subject line.\\nIf you don't know the sender,\\nand no subject line or an incomplete one is given,\\nyou probably delete the message.\\nSo the subject line is crucial in determining\\nif the message will be read.\\nWhich of the following would\\nbe an effective subject line?\\nProcedure.\\nJob procedure.\\nAdvertisement procedure.\\n\\nHow to fill job openings faster.\\nNew job advertisement procedure\\nto fill openings faster.\\nObviously, just the one word procedure\\ncould be one of many in the company.\\nYour chances are, when the reader saw a job\\nor advertisement procedure, he might say,\\n\\\"I know what the job advertisement procedure is,\\\"\\nand not read the email.\\nSee how important the words \\\"new\\\"\\nand \\\"to fill openings faster\\\" are?\\nOr what about that email message\\nthat replies to a reply to a reply?\\nOr is forwarded FYI,\\nand contains a series of messages.\\n\\nHere's an actual example of an email series\\nthat resulted in,\\n\\\"Well, you decide what the problem is.\\\"\\nThis series is between my support staff person\\nin the computer department after I sent the\\ndepartment support person this message.\\nIt sounded polite and innocent to me.\\n\\\"Could I please get a permanent mobile cart\\n\\\"assigned to room 417?\\n\\\"Thanks.\\\"\\nBut here's what happened next.\\nMy support staff sent a message\\nto the tech department.\\n\\\"Do you assign mobile cart to the classroom?\\n\\\"Judy has requested to have one assigned\\n\\\"to room 417.\\n\\n\\\"Please let me know.\\\"\\nTech reply.\\n\\\"This isn't our classroom.\\n\\\"It's a Yooitz classroom.\\n\\\"There should be one in the room,\\n\\\"but you might have her double check.\\\"\\nMy support staff to me.\\n\\\"Judy, you might want to double check\\n\\\"the room and if, in fact, you do not have\\n\\\"an overhead, I'll check with Yooitz.\\\"\\nMy response.\\n\\\"I'm 100% certain that there wasn't one\\n\\\"in there today, at least not before I left at 12:30.\\\"\\nI still thought I was being tactful,\\nsince what I really wanted to write was,\\n\\\"Do you think I would've seen it if it had been there?\\n\\\"It's a large cart.\\\"\\nBut I refrained.\\n\\nSupport staff to tech department.\\n\\\"Could we please find out while there's not a\\n\\\"mobile cart in room 417 because there should be.\\n\\\"Judy is upset that one isn't available.\\n\\\"If you have any further questions,\\n\\\"please let me know.\\\"\\nDo you think I sounded upset\\nin my previous message?\\nMaybe my suppressed tone wasn't as\\nconcealed as I thought it was.\\nThe rest of the story?\\nI immediately, personally sent a message\\nexplaining why I needed a cart on a permanent\\nbasis, that I understood there aren't enough carts\\nfor every room, and that I wasn't upset.\\n\\nHindsight?\\nI should've walked down one floor and asked\\ndirectly, face-to-face.\\nToo much time was wasted\\nsending that series of emails.\\nAnother takeaway from that example\\nis that the writer's tone does not\\nconvey well in emails.\\nSo although email is quick, and the reader\\nhas access to it anytime,\\nthe writer does have to consider\\nif email is the correct channel,\\nespecially if it contains confidential information.\\nThe writer needs to ensure the subject\\nline is clear, so if the reader immediately knows\\nthe message's purpose, and finally,\\nthe message should have a courteous tone.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:162433\",\"duration\":299,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Special considerations for

external, periodic, progress,\\nand add to those, financial, special, recommendation,\\njustification, research.\\nWhat a list.\\nAll those terms identify different types and formats\\nof business reports.\\n\\nEven though reports can be classified\\nin a variety of categories, they do all have commonalities.\\nRegardless of the report you're writing,\\nyou have to consider the report's purpose,\\nit's length, it's reader's characteristics,\\nand the reader's expectations.\\nLook at how each of those decisions\\nimpacts how you approach writing that business report.\\nAs we generally examine these areas,\\nkeep in mind that exceptions do exist,\\nas many report types, formats, and terms exist,\\nas there are companies.\\n\\nThis general information,\\nalong with examining the reports used in your company,\\nwill help you write that effective business report.\\nLet's start with a report type.\\nReports are usually grouped into\\ninformational or analytical.\\nResearch may have to be conducted\\nto prepare both types of reports,\\nbut just one presents that information,\\nwhereas the second actually analyzes the information\\nand concludes your recommends.\\nSo, the report type is tied directly\\nwith the report's purpose.\\nIs it just to present information,\\nor does it need to persuade?\\nIn business, a careful analysis of facts\\nand well-supported assumptions persuade,\\nnot opinions or general statements.\\n\\nUsing superlatives and emotional words,\\nsuch as greatest ever and wonderful opportunity,\\nshould be avoided.\\nSpecific facts should do the persuading.\\nNot, this will make lots of money,\\nbut we can mark up this item 120%.\\nHow often is the report prepared?\\nPeriodically on a regular basis,\\nonce a month or once a year, for example,\\nor is it a special report?\\nMaybe a month into the latest campaign,\\nmanagement wants to be updated\\non the progress of the campaign,\\nboth what is going well and what is not.\\n\\nIs the reader inside or outside the company,\\nand what formality level does that reader expect,\\nand what jargon can be used?\\nFor example, an internal recommendation report,\\nsometimes called a justification report,\\ncan contain technical information\\nand technical jargon that may be understood\\nonly by those in that field.\\nWho reads the report may also, in part,\\ndetermine the formality of the report.\\nShort, one- or two-page, internal memo reports\\nare more likely to be informal,\\nmeaning that first person pronouns will be used.\\n\\nLong manuscript type, external reports,\\nare more likely to be formal.\\nNo first person, such as I or we,\\nor second person, such as you or your pronouns.\\nNo contractions and more passive voice,\\nbecause the focus is on the content,\\nrather than on who wrote the report.\\nAn example of active and passive would be,\\nI found when I researched, is active.\\nThe focus is on the writer.\\nThe research showed is passive,\\nmore focus on the actual report's content.\\n\\nWhat parts should the report have?\\nThe longer the report, the more likely it will have\\na title page, a table of contents to guide the reader,\\na letter to the reader to transmit the report,\\nand visual aids.\\nShould the report use the direct deductive arrangement\\nor the indirect inductive arrangement?\\nThat decision is also partially made based on the reader.\\nIf you think your reader will be receptive to your idea\\nand has been involved in the entire process,\\nthen you will probably want to be direct,\\nbegin with the purpose.\\nFor example, in a recommendation report\\nyou would begin with the recommendation.\\n\\nAnalyze if your reader might be\\nskeptical or hostile, however,\\nand has little knowledge of what the report's purpose is.\\nIf that's the situation, then you are more likely\\nto have to prepare your reader by introducing him\\nto the report's purpose with background information\\nand support for your recommendation\\nbefore actually recommending.\\nRegardless of the reader, the formality, the type\\nor purpose of the report, all reports need to use lists\\nfor information that you want to be sure your reader sees.\\nInclude transition between the main ideas.\\n\\nUse language your reader understands\\nand be reader-friendly, with descriptive internal headings,\\nsuch as the following.\\nThe heading previews for the reader\\nwhat the section is about.\\nTen percent workforce reduction projected.\\nNorthwest stores will be affected most.\\nSoutheast stores will give early

many paper memos do you read\\ncompared to emails you receive?\\nObviously, memos are declining\\nas email messages increase.\\nThose memos that are used are almost\\nalways sent internally, whereas the letter\\nis sent to external business readers.\\nHowever, even though the majority of information\\ntoday is conveyed through email, the memorandum,\\nor memo, for short, is still used in business.\\nWhat are some situations for which you might\\nchoose the memo as the best medium to use?\\nA memo might be an attachment\\nto an email message, or it may be something\\nthat's posted on the bulletin board\\nfor all employees to see.\\n\\nTherefore, business writers still need\\nto know the correct style and parts of a memo.\\nIn all the following examples,\\nthe memo could stand alone,\\nor it could be that attachment\\nto an email message, or both.\\nCompany policy changes.\\nHours, products sold, insurance.\\nAnything employees need to know.\\nOr announcements.\\nA promotion, a welcome to a new employee,\\nholiday parties, a congratulatory message\\nthat an employee might want to frame.\\nMaybe a request for action.\\n\\nDo employees need to sign up\\nfor something by a specific time?\\nAre volunteers being requested\\nto help in the community?\\nOr that memo might be sent as a reminder\\nto clean up the break room or a company wide picnic.\\nSo basically, the purpose of a memo is to convey\\ninformation, and like all business writing,\\nshould be concise and clear, easy to read,\\nand mechanically correct.\\nThe reader's name is in the \\\"To\\\" block.\\nThe writer's name is in the \\\"From\\\".\\nThen the date, and the subject line.\\n\\nSubject lines are always important\\nin quickly identifying for the reader\\nthe purpose of a memo.\\nIf a reader has four or five memos\\non the desk to read, she will probably glance\\nat the subject line, along with the writer's name,\\nto decide which to read first.\\nThe other thing the reader will see immediately\\nis how inviting the memo is to read.\\nA 25-line paragraph doesn't make the reader\\neager to wade through that message.\\nA couple 5-6 line paragraphs combined\\nwith a bulleted list or a numbered list\\nlets your reader scan and skim that message\\nquickly because it looks and is easy to read.\\n\\nAs the reader glances at the memo,\\nhe expects a brief introduction to tell\\nthe reader the memo's purpose.\\nThe subject line does not replace\\nthe introductory paragraph of a memo.\\nEven though they may sound similar,\\neach is independent.\\nFor example, the subject line might say,\\n\\\"New Operating Hours Begin Friday.\\\"\\nThe first paragraph should be,\\n\\\"Beginning Friday, our stores new operating hours\\n\\\"will be 8:00 am to 6:00 pm, rather than our current\\n\\\"9:00 to 5:00 hours.\\\"\\nMemo readers expect to learn information efficiently,\\nso each section of the memo needs to help the reader\\nfind the key information with headings and lists.\\n\\nInclude only the information that\\nthe reader actually needs, but do include\\nsupporting ideas, facts and research to back up\\nyour key points, if necessary.\\nThe concluding section will summarize\\nthose key points.\\nGive the reader a strong takeaway, such as\\nthe action needed.\\nFor example, \\\"Be sure to set your alarm clock\\n\\\"an hour earlier Thursday night.\\\"\\nThe ending section may also indicate\\nto whom questions should be directed\\nand contact information for that person.\\nBecause the sender is listed in the \\\"From\\\"\\nposition in the heading, no signature is needed,\\nbut typically, the memo writer signs a memo\\nby initialing beside the typewritten name.\\n\\nAlthough the length of memos will vary,\\nmost are 1-2 single space pages\\nwith possible attachments\\nsuch as graphs or other illustrations.\\nIf you decide the memo is the best choice\\nfor the information you need to write,\\nkeep in mind that different organizations\\nmay have different memo requirements\\nand procedures, so be flexible\\nwhen preparing a memo.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:162435\",\"duration\":261,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Special considerations for handwritten

Can we all make a deal together?  \\n Let's always start with an executive summary.  \\n This is the \\\"so what\\\" for the audience,  \\n a single slide or perhaps half a page  \\n in a written document or email.  \\n It's the TLDR, it's the elevator pitch.  \\n It's the summary of what's most important  \\n for an often time-starved reader to understand  \\n if they only read this and nothing else in the rest  \\n of our document, they've gotten the main messages.  \\n I recommend three to six main bullets,  \\n tends to be four or five, that not only convey  \\n the main \\\"so what,\\\" but are also our map or blueprint  \\n of how the rest of our document is going to flow.  \\n Starting with the executive summary has four advantages.  \\n First, it's what the audience wants.  \\n Most of us, especially executives, want the \\\"so what\\\"  \\n as quickly as possible versus needing to dig into  \\n long documents or presentations.  \\n Readers expect thorough thinking as the foundation  \\n driving whenever we're recommending,  \\n but they don't want to have to weed through  \\n all that thinking.  \\n They want to understand the context  \\n and most important, what action we're recommending.  \\n Second, the executive summary  \\n structures our own thinking around what's most important.  \\n It's easy to get start figuring out all the data  \\n and graphics and tables we want to share,  \\n but that bottom-up approach is really inefficient.  \\n Let's think of ourselves as architects of our story.  \\n Where an architect starts with the main structure  \\n of the house, which areas of the house  \\n are for socializing versus sleeping,  \\n and then they narrow down to which room is which  \\n and how they flow together, finally digging into  \\n the location of specific appliances and plugs.  \\n We want to do the same as architects of our story.  \\n We do this by drafting our executive summary  \\n as early as possible in the writing process,  \\n before we start creating the full document,  \\n rather than, as is sometimes the case,  \\n as something we do right at the end,  \\n right before the deadline.  \\n Where I highly recommend drafting on paper initially.  \\n I keep a ready supply of white paper at my desk  \\n so I can quickly sketch out the flow.  \\n At least for me, doing it on a computer  \\n leads to getting hung up too quickly on wording.  \\n It's like the architect agonizing  \\n over the brand of the appliances  \\n or the color of the walls before the blueprint/s finished.  \\n Where doing it by hand means I focus more  \\n on whether the major building blocks are flowing together  \\n to tell a clear and logical story.  \\n The third advantage an executive summary offers  \\n is it's a much more efficient way  \\n of completing the rest of our document.  \\n I've found that if the executive summary storyline  \\n is crisp enough, we find we need less supporting detail  \\n than we'd originally expected.  \\n It's also much easier to understand  \\n what kind of materials we need to include  \\n if the executive summary guides our agenda  \\n and major messages.  \\n Fourth and finally, the executive summary  \\n is easy to share early and often.  \\n Whether we're sharing with a broader team,  \\n a colleague, perhaps our boss, we can quickly share  \\n our single-page draft to ensure we're on track.  \\n It's also much easier to give us feedback.  \\n Reacting to a page is quick and easy,  \\n much less time-consuming than reacting to a full document.  \\n Therefore, an executive summary is one,  \\n what the audience wants,  \\n two, helps structure our thinking,  \\n three, is more efficient for completing  \\n the rest of our document, and four,  \\n is so easy to share with others,  \\n how could we possibly not create one?  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3073732\",\"duration\":216,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"And, but, and therefore\",\"fileName\":\"2453148_en_US_01_02_LA30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, explore why and, but, and therefore are the three most important words to help craft your message effectively, and guide the reader to your most salient and crucial points.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":47056235,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

I'm not sure how you think about the word crisp,  \\n but I grew up in London,  \\n and I always think of crisp  \\n as describing a perfect autumn day,  \\n that's a combination of fresh, it's dry, and it's cold.  \\n While we don't want our writing to be cold,  \\n I love the idea of thinking about our writing as crisp,  \\n it's clear, it's to the point, it eliminates jargon.  \\n One of the surest ways to not be crisp  \\n is to use a lot of weasel words.  \\n Weasel words are words or phrases  \\n that try to create an impression,  \\n we've said something meaningful and specific,  \\n but in reality we've been vague and ambiguous.  \\n An analysis of weasel words across all of Wikipedia  \\n shows they fall into three categories.  \\n The first is numerically vague.  \\n For example, instead of using data and precise numbers,  \\n we talk about many customers or research suggests.  \\n The second is when we use adverbs  \\n that weaken a statement.  \\n We start to use often or probably.  \\n And, the third is when we use the passive voice  \\n to avoid specifying an authority.  \\n For example, it is believed that, or it is decided that.  \\n Started with numerically vague,  \\n this is when, instead of using a number, or specific data,  \\n we hedge with vague statements.  \\n Instead of 43% of our customers are satisfied,  \\n that's clear, that's crisp,  \\n we say many customers are satisfied.  \\n or instead of our survey of 600 employees  \\n showed 74% agreed to our proposal,  \\n again, specific and clear,  \\n we say research suggests employees support our proposal.  \\n Experts recommend, some prospects believe,  \\n the list goes on and on,  \\n vague trumping specific.  \\n For adverbs that weaken,  \\n this is difficult because it's so much easier to be vague  \\n than to be concrete and specific.  \\n It's easier to write,  \\n our product is significantly better than the competition,  \\n than to write,  \\n our product is 37% better than the competition.  \\n Ideally, on some specific dimension,  \\n or it's easier to say,  \\n our risk of employee attrition is probably low,  \\n rather than we expect 20% of employees  \\n to leave our company in the next 12 months.  \\n Similar examples or phrases like,  \\n this decision could result in,  \\n or launching this new process would help...  \\n Accurate statements that are so vague  \\n as to say almost nothing,  \\n where yes, unfortunately the phrase almost nothing  \\n is an example of a weasel word.  \\n I apologize, but at least I'm aware of it.  \\n Moving to active and passive voice,  \\n the passive deflect responsibility  \\n from whoever the actor or responsible person is.  \\n We learn as kids that subject verb object,  \\n at least in English,  \\n is the simplest sentence structure.  \\n But, sometimes we write these awful sentences,  \\n such as it's been decided  \\n that we need to lay off 400 employees,  \\n instead of I, the CEO or we the board  \\n decided that we need to lay off 400 employees.  \\n The passive voice removes the responsible party,  \\n the key who actor.  \\n Finally, jargon is the annoying little cousin  \\n of weasel words.  \\n Here's a list of baddies where some of my personal favorites  \\n are incrementality, actionable, intentionality,  \\n and the dreaded synergy.  \\n A good test is if a 10 year old, or 12 year old,  \\n or perhaps a parent, or grandparent  \\n doesn't understand what we're saying,  \\n let's edit our document  \\n to identify where we can remove jargon  \\n and make it simpler and more adjustable,  \\n and, above all, more crisp.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3069723\",\"duration\":137,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Be concise: Less is more\",\"fileName\":\"2453148_en_US_02_03_LA30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, explore active vs. passive voice, and why active is best for clarity and crispness in your comms.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":31321787,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

 \\n And we build and maintain trust  \\n by ensuring our document's easy to consume,  \\n avoiding any seemingly small mistakes that can distract  \\n and even derail our reader's experience.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3072775\",\"duration\":213,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"The top five list\",\"fileName\":\"2453148_en_US_03_02_LA30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"Take a quick tour through James' top five list of tips for making sure your communication style stays crisp and clear.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":47035045,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - As we begin to close,  \\n I'd love to highlight a quickfire fab five  \\n parting So What habits for all of us to adopt  \\n when we're writing at work.  \\n First, let's always include an executive summary  \\n and always write it first.  \\n Let's give readers what they want up front,  \\n the TLDR or main So What.  \\n And if we write it first,  \\n we have the story architecture, then much easier to fill in  \\n all our supporting storylines.  \\n Two, and, but, therefore  \\n are our best friends for storytelling.  \\n What Snap, Crackle, and Pop are to breakfast cereal,  \\n and, but, and therefore are to storytelling at work.  \\n Start with good news, or perhaps bad news,  \\n then we use a but to shift to the opposite.  \\n A cloud if we started with good news,  \\n a shimmer of sunlight if we started with bad news.  \\n And then we use this good news and bad news  \\n shared context to drive our therefore recommendation.  \\n And remember, the intro is key to establishing  \\n shared context with our reader.  \\n We want to tell 'em something they already know  \\n with and and but before we change their mind  \\n with our therefore.  \\n Number three is our three So What tests.  \\n Test number one is the 70% rule.  \\n The reader can get 70% of the main message  \\n from the entire document from only reading  \\n the bolded bullets or headlines in the executive summary,  \\n maybe three to six bullets or headlines.  \\n Test number two is the 80% rule.  \\n The reader can get 80% of the main message  \\n from reading the complete executive summary,  \\n adding the sub bullets or supporting sentences  \\n to those main bullets or headlines in test number one.  \\n Test number three is the 90% rule.  \\n The reader can get 90% of the main message  \\n from reading the full executive summary  \\n and then adds on reading the slides or section headers  \\n throughout the document.  \\n Not the full text, not tables, not graphics,  \\n just the slide or section headers.  \\n And remember, if 90% of the main message is coming through  \\n from our executive summary and headers,  \\n let's prioritize our time making sure those are great  \\n versus leaving them to the last minute.  \\n Number four is to strive to be conversational,  \\n crisp, and concise.  \\n For conversational, let's remember to write  \\n with the same tone as if we're saying it out loud.  \\n Let's write a quick draft to structure our thoughts,  \\n then share it with somebody else  \\n out loud without looking at it.  \\n Almost always the way we say it out loud  \\n is better than our written draft.  \\n It's more conversational,  \\n it's easy to understand,  \\n so we want to write it in the same way  \\n we'd say it out loud.  \\n For crisp, let's remember to avoid weasel words and jargon.  \\n Let's use data rather than vagaries.  \\n 40% of customers, rather than many customers.  \\n Or we decreased page load times  \\n from 1 second to 0.5 seconds  \\n rather than we made performance much faster.  \\n And let's avoid jargon that vision to business yuckiness  \\n like incrementality, actionable, synergy.  \\n For concise, let's remember that less is more.  \\n Let's make it easier for our audience  \\n by having headlines and slide titles on one line  \\n and that tell the So What versus act as a descriptor.  \\n We're ahead of expectations 115% of our initial targets,  \\n rather than performance versus target.  \\n And let's keep it short.  \\n When's the last time anybody wished a document was longer?  \\n Finally, number five is to imagine  \\n we're telling our story to cave people.  \\n Our audience, especially executives, are busy.  \\n What's our cave person answer?  \\n Is our news good or bad?  \\n Do we want the reader to be happy or sad?  \\n If we couldn't string together a full sentence  \\n would we blurt out, \\\"Good,\\\" or, \\\"Bad?\\\"  \\n And how do you want 'em to react  \\n if they can't speak themselves?  \\n Nodding their heads peacefully in a friendly manner,  \\n or shaking their heads and getting hot and bothered?  \\n Let's make sure our cave person answer  \\n clearly comes through.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

But there is one part that matters.  \\n The writer says he won't be available for work  \\n until the 1st of August.  \\n Now, that's an important fact  \\n from the reader's point of view.  \\n So let's add it back in to that first paragraph.  \\n I'm responding to your job listing  \\n for an experienced developmental editor,  \\n ideally to start around August 1st.  \\n Now the letter is better but it's still  \\n missing something very important.  \\n The writer never actually said  \\n what the reader should do next.  \\n There's no short-term goal. There's no action item.  \\n So let's add one in.  \\n Please write back to set up a time to talk by phone.  \\n I look forward to hearing from you.  \\n Now, if this is an email, then it's clear  \\n that the reader should just hit reply to respond.  \\n But if it's a paper letter, I would also make sure  \\n that the address was in an obvious place,  \\n like right up at the top of the page.  \\n This letter could still stand to be improved  \\n but at least the goals are there.  \\n There's the long-term goal and the short-term goal.  \\n And at this point, you might be thinking wait a minute,  \\n there's nothing to that second letter.  \\n It's just too simple.  \\n But it actually gives more useful information  \\n in fewer words, which is really what you want.  \\n And the writer can always add that stuff in  \\n about his history with solar power if he wants  \\n but only after making his goals clear.  \\n The point is to emphasize your goals  \\n and what you want to happen next.  \\n If you stay focused on these things, you'll write letters  \\n that are easier to read and understand,  \\n leading to a better chance of positive responses.  \\n

Effective business letters demonstrate  \\n that you've done your homework and are now turning  \\n to your correspondent to take the next step.  \\n The research you do before you write shows that you value  \\n the other person's time and are ready to act now.  \\n This video provides methods for doing that research  \\n as well as tips for applying it in effective ways.  \\n Our example is from someone applying to a job as an editor.  \\n He's responding to an online ad,  \\n so the ad itself is the perfect place to start our research.  \\n We've created a fictional ad  \\n for the purpose of this example.  \\n Here, your correspondent is telling you  \\n exactly what they want in the job ad.  \\n This is what journalists call a primary source  \\n because there's nobody in the middle  \\n filtering out the information.  \\n All you have to do is determine  \\n whether you match the job's requirements  \\n and then show them that you can fulfill them.  \\n In short, this text is gold,  \\n yet most people who want this job won't even bother  \\n to read the information thoroughly before they write.  \\n But you are going to use these cues  \\n to write a letter that stands out.  \\n We'll start with a draft letter that you'll find  \\n in this course's exercise files if you have access to them.  \\n In the first draft, the writer put in  \\n some pretty generic text to assert his credentials.  \\n I currently work at JustTheSun Publishing where I enjoy  \\n creating materials that inspire fantasy as well as thought.  \\n Now we're going to replace that with examples of text  \\n that are specific to this job.  \\n What you're looking for is points of agreement,  \\n places where what they need matches what you offer.  \\n I've chosen a few for our fictional job applicant.  \\n The job's purpose is to, quote,  \\n \\\"develop green living guidebooks for publication.\\\"  \\n In this requirement section is something about, quote,  \\n \\\"understanding technical concepts  \\n around science, energy, and green living.\\\"  \\n So our letter should emphasize the writer's experience  \\n in the topic of green living.  \\n And since they used that term twice,  \\n we should use it as well.  \\n Let's try this.  \\n I currently work at JustTheSun publishing  \\n where I create materials about such aspects of green living  \\n as renewable energy and sustainable housekeeping.  \\n Reading further, we see that the job means, quote,  \\n \\\"identifying and coaching authors\\\" and, quote,  \\n \\\"teaching authors how to develop their manuscripts.\\\"  \\n In other words, they want to know that applicants  \\n have experience managing others.  \\n And interestingly, the job never actually suggests  \\n that the applicant will write materials,  \\n just help other authors develop them.  \\n So even though this applicant  \\n has both writing and editing experience,  \\n it makes more sense to emphasize the editing.  \\n So instead of I create materials,  \\n let's change it to I help others to create materials,  \\n assuming of course that that's true for this applicant.  \\n Or better yet, be specific.  \\n For example, I've helped about a dozen writers  \\n to create materials about renewable energy  \\n and sustainable housekeeping.  \\n Going on, we see that they want four years or more  \\n of previous editorial experience.  \\n So let's make it clear that we meet that requirement,  \\n even if we have to explain a bit to do so.  \\n So let's try I currently work at JustTheSun Publishing  \\n where over the past three years,  \\n I've helped about a dozen writers to create materials  \\n about such aspects of green living  \\n as renewable energy and sustainable housekeeping.  \\n Prior to that, I was a writer and copy editor  \\n for three years at the Mid-Urban Tribune.  \\n Then you would just continue to iterate,  \\n emphasizing those facets where you truly shine.  \\n Now note that in this process of close reading,  \\n you might uncover things that convince you  \\n not to write the letter at all.  \\n For example, this particular job wants you to give, quote,  \\n \\\"a minimum of 40 hours per week working remotely  \\n from a home office.\\\"  \\n Now if that doesn't work for you,  \\n it's better to discover it now and not write the letter  \\n than to waste your time and theirs.  \\n After all, the goal isn't to write a lot of letters.  \\n It's to write the right letters in the right way  \\n to the right people.  \\n And of course this is just one example.  \\n You won't always have such good source material  \\n for understanding what your correspondent wants.  \\n But looking through such places as company websites,  \\n social media, and news stories, you'll gain an edge  \\n that less motivated writers simply won't have.  \\n

- Even the best written business letter will miss the mark  \\n if it's sent to the wrong person.  \\n This video shows you how to find the right target  \\n for your letter.  \\n For our example, we're applying to a job listing.  \\n Now in this case, there's an apply now link that leads  \\n to a form.  \\n But what if this wasn't here?  \\n The first thing I'd do is to look for a name connected  \\n with that ad, and then follow up with that person,  \\n but it's actually fairly common that you have  \\n to dig just a little bit deeper to figure  \\n out where you should send your letter.  \\n The company's contact page is one possibility.  \\n Especially if it includes a link or form for job applicants,  \\n but no, here it's just a single form,  \\n which I assume sends the message  \\n to some random administrator.  \\n So this is a possibility, but let's keep looking.  \\n We'll keep exploring the site for clues to attach a person  \\n to this job posting.  \\n In particular, we're looking for an about page  \\n that might list who's in the company and what they do.  \\n We could also look through blog posts  \\n and maybe some news stories about the company,  \\n but I also see that there are social media links here  \\n to Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.  \\n For a letter about a job,  \\n I think LinkedIn is our best target.  \\n Now this is useful.  \\n Not only can we learn more about the company,  \\n but this link lets us see the profiles  \\n of people who work there.  \\n Now we're writing about a job as a developmental editor.  \\n So I'll scroll through for someone in publications  \\n or marketing or similar, or for someone in human resources,  \\n the hiring department.  \\n Now we could send our letter to the CEO and hope that  \\n that person forwards our message,  \\n but that's kind of indirect,  \\n and more likely to work only for smaller companies.  \\n So, let's keep looking.  \\n We wouldn't send it to an engineer,  \\n or an installation technician, of course.  \\n Ah, here's someone who looks promising,  \\n the marketing manager.  \\n There are ways to send her a message through LinkedIn,  \\n or we could do further research to try  \\n to find a direct address.  \\n We might even call the company and try to get her  \\n on the phone to confirm that she's the right person  \\n to contact, or to ask her for a referral if she's not.  \\n Now, that brings us to a technique I often use,  \\n asking for referrals.  \\n It often happens that even after you've researched  \\n and researched,  \\n you're still not sure you have the right target.  \\n In those cases, I'll add a line to the letter like,  \\n my research shows that you're the best person to contact  \\n for this.  \\n If not, I'd appreciate if you could just forward my message,  \\n or refer me to the right person.  \\n The important thing is  \\n that you're getting as close as you can.  \\n Even if you don't find the perfect target  \\n by meeting them halfway, you show respect,  \\n and it increases the likelihood  \\n that your letter will ultimately reach the person  \\n who can best fulfill your request.  \\n

As in face-to-face communication,  \\n content is only part of your message.  \\n The other part is conveyed through tone,  \\n the body language of writing.  \\n This video demonstrates how subject lines,  \\n greetings and closings frame the content  \\n and describe some ways  \\n to support the tone that you want to create.  \\n Tone is one place where there are some differences  \\n between letters on paper and letters through email.  \\n Paper letters tend to be more formal.  \\n For example, a paper letter to me  \\n is likely to open with Dear Mr. Geller  \\n but an email, it might simply start  \\n with Mr. Geller or even just Tom.  \\n Now, that extra formality for paper letters  \\n is well-established.  \\n Business letters from 50 years ago look a lot  \\n like business letters written on paper today.  \\n But emails from even 10 or 20 years ago  \\n are quite different from those written today.  \\n The rules of style just haven't finished settling.  \\n Another difference is that paper letters  \\n look exactly as you printed them.  \\n You can count on the letterhead  \\n and fonts of a printed letter  \\n but email looks different depending  \\n on the device, the operating system  \\n and the email program.  \\n So don't use such things as graphics  \\n or bold text or fonts  \\n just to get your tone across in email.  \\n Now, in past years, there were lots of books  \\n about creating a formal tone  \\n through details, such as punctuation  \\n and address formatting.  \\n But I don't think they're worth discussing here  \\n for two reasons.  \\n First, those details can vary in very subtle ways.  \\n For example, between Great Britain and the United States.  \\n Second, such details are easy to find online  \\n by searching for, let's say formal business letter.  \\n One site I like for such things is bab.la.  \\n The letter writing stuff is under the phrases menu.  \\n This site is also great for formal greetings  \\n and such in other languages.  \\n So instead of details,  \\n let's look at some general matters of tone  \\n in the greeting, body and closing  \\n and in particular, for email.  \\n Overall, you want your tone  \\n to reflect the relationship  \\n that you've already established.  \\n So if you usually call each other by first name in person,  \\n feel free open your letter with Dear Susan or just Susan.  \\n But if it's the first time you're interacting,  \\n simple, yet formal does the trick,  \\n so either Ms. Smith or Dear Ms. Smith is fine.  \\n Now, the tricky part  \\n is when you don't know your correspondent's name.  \\n You could use a formula phrase,  \\n such as to whom it may concern or dear sir or madam.  \\n But I personally find these a little bit too old-fashioned  \\n for email especially.  \\n Slightly better is using the company name,  \\n such as Dear Widget Factory  \\n or the position's name, such as Dear Sales Department.  \\n Or in email, you can just leave the greeting off.  \\n But by and large, don't worry too much about the greeting.  \\n The one thing that can hurt you  \\n is if you make incorrect assumptions,  \\n if you misspell someone's name  \\n or call a doctor mister or misgender someone.  \\n So again, research before you write.  \\n That brings us to the body of the letter.  \\n Again, it should reflect your existing relationship  \\n or be simple yet formal if it's your first contact.  \\n That means avoiding such things as emoticons.  \\n In short, present yourself as you want to be seen,  \\n keeping in mind the ultimate goals of your letter.  \\n Finally, we come to the closing.  \\n In email, the options are the same as for paper letters:  \\n sincerely, best regards and the like, they're all fine.  \\n But the closing is also a moment  \\n when you can remind them of the next step.  \\n So I often close emails with something like looking forward  \\n to your response.  \\n Then, of course, add your email signature.  \\n In short, your letter doesn't stand alone.  \\n It's written in the context  \\n of your existing relationship  \\n and your goals, and how you want to be seem.  \\n So let your tone reflect these contexts  \\n to make your letter not just a statement  \\n but part of a conversation.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2483373\",\"duration\":205,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Getting to the point\",\"fileName\":\"608988_en_US_02_02_2022Q1_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to present useful information as concisely as possible, thereby engaging your correspondent and encouraging a positive response.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":10446783,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" -

There's no reason to be afraid  \\n to address difficult topics  \\n such as complaints or demands.  \\n This video helps you make those interactions  \\n cooperative efforts rather than confrontations  \\n and highlights the sandwich technique  \\n to keep the discussion's tone positive.  \\n Let's use a sadly common example,  \\n writing a letter to get paid for work that you already did.  \\n Here's a short first draft of such a letter  \\n with several exaggerated, but common errors.  \\n Quote, you owe me money and I'm really mad about it.  \\n I created graphics for your website  \\n but never got the payment you promised.  \\n I think you were lying when you hired me.  \\n You never had the money to begin with.  \\n I expect you to pay me as soon as possible  \\n or I'll see you in court.  \\n Now I know that if I got such a letter  \\n I'd want to fight them, not help them.  \\n So let's take a deep breath and then look  \\n at how to make this cooperative instead of confrontational.  \\n First of all, what good does it do to say that you're mad?  \\n So we'll strike that part.  \\n It also doesn't do any good to say.  \\n I think you are lying when you hired me.  \\n After all, they might have just lost the invoice.  \\n So we'll strike that.  \\n Then at the end, we have this  \\n I'll see you in court business.  \\n Experienced business people only take this seriously  \\n when it's from an attorney,  \\n it doesn't add any real weight to your letter.  \\n So unless you're truly need to lawyer up, out it goes,  \\n but now we don't have much to our letter, do we?  \\n Let's rewrite it  \\n with a more positive solution oriented attitude.  \\n The first sentence is currently you owe me money.  \\n I created graphics for your website  \\n but I never got the payment you promised.  \\n We can do better by providing details  \\n that your correspondent might simply not have.  \\n Like so.  \\n You contracted me to create graphics that now appear  \\n on your website per our agreement payment of $350 was due  \\n on May 1st, but I unfortunately still haven't received it.  \\n Let's also add details to the next sentence, which says  \\n I expect you to pay me as soon as possible.  \\n How's this?  \\n I've attached a copy of the invoice  \\n that I previously sent you on March 15th.  \\n I accept payment by check, direct deposit,  \\n PayPal or Bitcoin.  \\n Details are in the invoice.  \\n Now let's revisit that I'll see you in court text.  \\n You probably won't hire a lawyer to recover $350,  \\n but you do have other remedies at hand.  \\n Don't be afraid to remind them  \\n of the consequences as long as they're realistic.  \\n So for example, I'm afraid I'll be unable to do further work  \\n for you until I receive this payment.  \\n So now our letter is complete  \\n but it's still a little harsh.  \\n So I'd like to show you something called  \\n the sandwich technique to make it friendlier.  \\n In short, the difficult part goes right in the middle  \\n like the meat of a sandwich.  \\n Then you put something pleasant in the intro  \\n and the closing.  \\n They'll still get the message  \\n but they won't feel as bad about it.  \\n Here's an example opening that actually draws  \\n from the rest of the letter.  \\n It was a pleasure to work with you recently  \\n creating graphics that I see are now on the website.  \\n It looks great.  \\n Then I can remove that redundant part  \\n in the middle and rearrange it a bit.  \\n And then the closing, thanks again  \\n for the opportunity to work together.  \\n I look forward to continuing our productive relationship  \\n after this matter has been settled.  \\n And that's it.  \\n I think you'd agree that this is a small bump  \\n in our excellent relationship comes  \\n across a lot better than you cheated me.  \\n And I hate you, right?  \\n Of course, the tone  \\n for your difficult letter will depend completely  \\n on your relationship and what's gone before  \\n but whatever the situation you'll catch more flies  \\n with honey than with vinegar.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2476451\",\"duration\":262,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Writing for accessibility\",\"fileName\":\"608988_en_US_02_04_2022Q1_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn ways that language usage and sensitivity to others' situations can help avoid barriers to understanding.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":11160118,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - Most writing advice is about making people want  \\n to read your writing.  \\n So it's easy to forget that a large portion  \\n of your audience simply can't understand your message  \\n because of physical impairment, language difficulty  \\n or cultural issues.  \\n Now there's nothing you can do  \\n about your audience's abilities,  \\n but there are ways to make your letters more accessible.  \\n Let's first consider physical impairments.  \\n Poor eyesight is the most obvious barrier to reading,  \\n but neurological and muscular conditions  \\n can also cause problems.  \\n For paper letters,  \\n it's easy to control the presentation.  \\n So just be sure  \\n that clever design doesn't trump readability.  \\n For email, however, you don't know how your letter will look  \\n on the other side, but the same advice holds true.  \\n Keep the design simple.  \\n In particular, don't lean  \\n on fonts or design elements to get your message across.  \\n They won't even show up on some email systems,  \\n such as screen readers for the blind.  \\n And on those that do,  \\n such tricks can cause more problems than they solve.  \\n That goes double for attachments  \\n such as PDFs or Word documents.  \\n The other big barrier to reading is language.  \\n Even in the United States, fully 20%  \\n of the population speaks a language other  \\n than English at home.  \\n And plenty of successful business people  \\n are weak in the language.  \\n You can help them by consciously simplifying your language.  \\n Here are some examples.  \\n Our first example uses two multi word verbs,  \\n also known as phrasal verbs.  \\n These are notoriously hard to understand  \\n because the individual words don't add up  \\n as expected.  \\n Consider, looked over is very different  \\n from overlooked, and breaking a sentence down  \\n is very different from a car breaking down.  \\n Convert these phrasal verbs  \\n to one word verbs wherever possible.  \\n The second example is a complicated and ambiguous tense.  \\n When you say I had been hoping to meet,  \\n it's not actually clear whether you still want to meet.  \\n English has a lot of such tenses.  \\n Make sure you're using the clearest and simplest one.  \\n Finally, we have little apple, little egg.  \\n Oh, you don't know that one?  \\n It's a very common expression, if you speak Dutch.  \\n Just as you probably don't know it,  \\n an expression like his idea was out of left field  \\n won't work for many people,  \\n especially if they know nothing about baseball.  \\n Watch out for such sayings where, like those phrasal verbs,  \\n the individual words don't actually add up  \\n to the full meaning.  \\n By the way, little apple, little egg  \\n in Dutch means that something is easy to do,  \\n kleine appel eitje.  \\n But all of these communication problems disappear  \\n if you can write in the language of your correspondent.  \\n But then the question is, should you?  \\n Are you sure  \\n that you know their language better than they know yours?  \\n Will you be able to understand their response,  \\n and will the correspondence need to be read by someone else,  \\n maybe someone who doesn't speak that language?  \\n Beyond words, watch out for standards  \\n that differ among countries and cultures.  \\n Take, for example, the sentence,  \\n call me at seven on 6/7 at 06 9359 4835.  \\n There are four opportunities for error here.  \\n First, does that mean 7:00 AM or 7:00 PM?  \\n In what time zone?  \\n Is 6/7 June 7th or July 6th?  \\n Do I have to dial a country code?  \\n When in doubt, write it out.  \\n So try this instead.  \\n Call me at 7:00 PM Central European Time  \\n on July 6th at +31, that's the country code,  \\n 6 9359 4835.  \\n But above all, remember this.  \\n Regardless of whether communication is hindered  \\n by physical, linguistic, or cultural causes,  \\n concise writing is always easier to read.  \\n Think of it this way.  \\n Some readers have to struggle  \\n through each word, each phrase, each sentence.  \\n So the fewer there are, the less they have to struggle.  \\n At the same time,  \\n there's no need to change your tone  \\n or content, only their communication is hindered,  \\n not their intelligence,  \\n or the opportunities  \\n for you to build a positive relationship.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

 \\n Some communications are relatively impersonal,  \\n so you don't care as much  \\n what your correspondent thinks of you.  \\n There's no real cost  \\n to writing them again,  \\n so you might as well do it.  \\n But for situations that require more tact,  \\n perhaps wait a bit longer.  \\n So let's say you've decided  \\n to write a follow up.  \\n The same rules apply here  \\n as for all letters about difficult subjects.  \\n Don't argue,  \\n don't assume malice,  \\n give specifics,  \\n and make resolution easy.  \\n Remember, there's a good chance  \\n they simply never got your earlier message.  \\n Here's a basic text.  \\n I'm afraid I didn't get a response  \\n to my letter of June 15th  \\n about our booth space at your convention.  \\n A fast reply would be appreciated,  \\n as we're trying finalize our travel plans.  \\n Thank you.  \\n Now that's just the core,  \\n of course you'll add your own details.  \\n Definitely include the earlier conversation  \\n in your follow-up.  \\n Now for email that's easy,  \\n just find the last email in the thread  \\n and hit reply or reply to all.  \\n Check the to line before sending though,  \\n because if you wrote last email  \\n you might accidentally only send  \\n the follow-up message to yourself.  \\n Or you could try this,  \\n instead of sending a follow-up letter,  \\n try contacting them  \\n through some other means,  \\n such as by phone.  \\n Here again, there are no absolute rules  \\n of when it's best to do this,  \\n you just have to feel it out.  \\n But I would like to suggest  \\n a rule for letters sent online,  \\n don't follow up through multiple online venues.  \\n If someone doesn't answer your emailed letter  \\n and it's truly important,  \\n it's probably fine to send  \\n an InMail on LinkedIn to ask,  \\n did you get my letter?  \\n But don't also follow up  \\n with their Twitter, and Facebook,  \\n and Instagram pages,  \\n it's just too much.  \\n And certainly don't follow up  \\n on their non-work social media accounts,  \\n that's a real bad one.  \\n Now let's say you've given up on your contact  \\n but you really need satisfaction  \\n for an important matter.  \\n You have a difficult decision,  \\n you write to someone else in the company?  \\n Here again, I would apply the TAP rules,  \\n check your timeline,  \\n alternatives,  \\n and peskiness cost.  \\n That last one is especially important,  \\n as you could be inciting  \\n bad feeling among colleagues.  \\n I think it's often a good idea  \\n to include something like,  \\n I previously discussed this with so and so,  \\n but I haven't heard from them lately.  \\n Again, use your judgment.  \\n Reminder letters set up  \\n an implicitly confrontational situation,  \\n because you're effectively  \\n pointing out something  \\n that they failed to do.  \\n But if you gauge your own need to follow-up  \\n and handle the matter politely,  \\n time spent writing follow-up letters  \\n can pay off handsomely.  \\n \\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2477412\",\"duration\":120,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Continuing the conversation\",\"fileName\":\"608988_en_US_03_02_2022Q1_MM30\",\"demo\":false,\"videoCreationMetadata\":null,\"description\":\"In this video, learn how to smoothly transition the conversation from the introductory first letters to full resolution or an ongoing relationship.\",\"captionsStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"cdnStatus\":\"AVAILABLE\",\"size\":4730462,\"solution\":false,\"welcomeContent\":null,\"challenge\":false,\"assetStatus\":\"COMPLETE\",\"transcript\":\" - So, you've gotten a response to your letter.  \\n If it satisfies you,  \\n you can send a simple thank you letter to close the matter.  \\n If it doesn't satisfy, you'll continue the conversation.  \\n But now you have a few important advantages.  \\n First, your correspondence response sets the tone  \\n and you should reflect it back to them.  \\n If they write short, you write short.  \\n If they use informal titles and greetings and such,  \\n you do the same.  \\n Establishing a relationship is like a dance  \\n and you want to be a good partner.  \\n Second, their letterhead or email signature  \\n might provide useful information  \\n such as phone numbers in case email bogs down  \\n or official titles you can use to show respect.  \\n Or they might have written their personal  \\n or company named differently  \\n from what you had in your first letter.  \\n Also take note of the from, to, and CC fields.  \\n They might have replied from a different address  \\n or maybe they added others to the conversation.  \\n The third advantage is obvious.  \\n The content of their letter  \\n helps you figure out your next move.  \\n Their response gives you another gift that's rather subtle.  \\n It gives you implied permission to use that information  \\n and to continue the conversation.  \\n That's true even if their response is discouraging.  \\n If it feels appropriate,  \\n I'll sometimes respond to a no letter  \\n with something along the lines of,  \\n \\\"Thanks for your response.  \\n \\\"Could you suggest other people I should talk to,  \\n \\\"or other ways I could satisfy my request?\\\"  \\n People can be quite generous with advice  \\n if you just ask them.  \\n Sometimes you'll get a response that doesn't really help.  \\n Either they misunderstood your letter  \\n or they're just not the right person to talk to.  \\n It can be frustrating to feel  \\n like you haven't been heard right.  \\n But be polite and persistent.  \\n Keep in mind that a wrong answer  \\n is still better than no answer  \\n because it's an invitation to correct the mistake  \\n and continue the conversation.  \\n \\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"3.

I'm so glad you were able to take this course.  \\n By improving your ability to write letters,  \\n you're helping to increase the quality of communication  \\n in your own life, in the business community,  \\n and in society as a whole.  \\n To this end, I hope that three lessons  \\n in particular stand out.  \\n The first is to be concise.  \\n When your point is clear and direct,  \\n you help your correspondent to help you.  \\n Second, cooperate with them to find a resolution.  \\n Even when your interests aren't aligned, you both want  \\n negotiations to be a smooth and pleasant experience.  \\n Both of these points add up to a third.  \\n Remember that your correspondent is a person  \\n with their own feelings and goals.  \\n Treat them as such, and they'll return the favor.  \\n That starts with understanding, so research who they are  \\n and what they want before you even start writing.  \\n This course focused on the grander aspects  \\n of letter writing: goals, cooperation,  \\n meaning, and things like that.  \\n That's because I believe that those are ultimately  \\n more important than whether your grammar is perfect.  \\n But I completely understand if you still  \\n want help with those things.  \\n Even expert writers sometimes need to check themselves.  \\n For this, I love the site bab.la,  \\n particularly the phrases menu.  \\n Here you'll find common phrases  \\n for all kinds of business correspondence  \\n in a wide variety of languages.  \\n I'd like to leave you with just one last piece of advice.  \\n If you find yourself struggling with a letter,  \\n take out your phone or other recording device,  \\n and record yourself just saying the message  \\n as if you're talking to a friendly colleague.  \\n Then listen to what you said,  \\n transcribe it to the page, and start from there.  \\n You have a voice.  \\n A well-written business letter  \\n serves to amplify and focus it.  \\n Congratulations on

helps you cut away unnecessary ideas,\\nletting you create messages that are short,\\nclear and on-point.\\nChances are you actually have two goals with your letter.\\nFirst, you want your correspondent to do something\\nright away, that's your short-term goal.\\nSecond, you want them to do it for a bigger purpose.\\n\\nThat's your long-term goal.\\nI recommend putting your long-term goal as\\nearly as possible so the reader knows immediately\\nwhy you're writing, and can put the rest of your\\nletter in that context.\\nThen make your short-term goal very clear,\\nwith instructions on how they can help you reach it.\\nThis is called an action item.\\nLet's take a look at how this works\\nby editing a sample letter.\\nIt's from someone who wants to get a job\\nas a developmental editor at a company that\\nmakes energy products such as solar panels.\\n\\nYou'll find the letter in the course's\\nexercise files if you have access to them.\\nThe first draft of this

materials that inspire fantasy\\nas well as thought.\\n\\nMy resume is attached.\\nNow, from the writer's point of view,\\nthe purpose is obvious, to apply for a job.\\nBut the recipient might get hundreds of such emails\\na day about dozens of topics.\\nDon't make the reader work to figure out\\nwhy you're writing.\\nTell them right away, be explicit and leave\\nin only the necessary parts.\\nHere's an example.\\nMy name is Salman Voorbeeld, and I'm responding\\nto your job listing for an experienced Developmental Editor.\\nMy resume is attached.\\n\\nNow the part that we cut out could be capped or\\nchanged or deleted.\\nFor now, let's leave it as it is, although\\nwe'll move it to its own paragraph.\\nContinuing on, the writer introduces a lot\\nof ideas that are likely to confuse or bore the reader.\\nThey'll see such irrelevant terms as \\\"true believers\\\"\\nand \\\"parents\\\" all mixed in there, and none of that\\nactually helps the writer to reach his goals.\\nSo, out it goes.\\nBut there is one part that matters.\\n\\nThe writer says he won't be available for work\\nuntil the 1st of August.\\nNow, that's an important fact from the\\nreader's point of view,\\nso let's add it back in to that first paragraph.\\nI'm responding to your job listing for an experienced\\nDevelopmental Editor, ideally to start around August 1st.\\nNow the letter is better, but it's still missing\\nsomething very important.\\nThe writer never actually said what\\nthe reader should do next.\\nThere's no short-term goal.\\nThere's no action item.\\nSo let's add one in.\\n\\nPlease write back to set up a time to talk by phone.\\nI look forward to hearing from you.\\nNow if this is an email, then it's clear that\\nthe reader should just hit Reply to respond.\\nBut if it's a paper letter, I would also\\nmake sure that the address was in an obvious place,\\nlike right up at the top of the page.\\nThis letter could still stand to be improved,\\nbut at least the

wants,\\nbut only after making his goals clear.\\nThe point is to emphasize your goals and what\\nyou want to happen next.\\nIf you stay focused on these things, you'll write\\nletters that are easier

you're looking for is points of agreement,\\nplaces where what they need\\nmatches what you offer.\\nI've chosen a few for our fictional job applicant.\\n\\nThe job's purpose is to quote\\ndevelop green living guidebooks for publication.\\nIn this Requirements section,\\nthere's something about quote understanding\\ntechnical concepts around science,\\nenergy and green living,\\nso our letter should emphasize the writer's experience\\nin the topic of green living\\nand since they use that term twice,\\nwe should use it as well.\\nLet's try this.\\nI currently work at JustTheSun Publishing,\\nwhere I create materials about such aspects\\nof green living as renewable energy\\nand sustainable housekeeping.\\n\\nReading further, we see that the job means quote\\nidentifying and coaching authors\\nand quote teaching authors\\nhow to develop their manuscripts.\\nIn other words, they want to know that applicants\\nhave experience managing others\\nand interestingly, the job never actually suggests\\nthat the applicant will write materials,\\njust help other authors develop them,\\nso even those this applicant has both writing\\nand editing experience,\\nit makes more sense to emphasize the editing.\\nSo, instead of I create materials,\\nlet's change it to help others to create materials\\nassuming of course that that's true for this applicant\\nor better yet, be specific.\\n\\nFor example, I've helped about a dozen writers\\nto create materials about renewable energy\\nand sustainable housekeeping.\\nGoing on we see that they want four years\\nor more of previous editorial experience.\\nSo, let's make it clear that we meet that requirement\\neven if we have to explain a bit to do so.\\nSo, let's try I currently work at JustTheSun Publishing,\\nwhere over the past three years\\nI've helped about a dozen writers to create materials\\nabout such aspects of green living\\nas renewable energy and sustainable housekeeping.\\n\\nPrior to that I was a writer\\nand copy editor for three years\\nat the Mid-Urban Tribune.\\nThen you would just continue to iterate,\\nemphasizing those facets where you truly shine.\\nNow, note that in this process of close reading,\\nyou might uncover things that convince you not to write\\nthe letter at all.\\nFor example, this particular job wants you to give quote\\na minimum of 40 hours per week\\nworking remotely from a home office.\\nNow, if that doesn't work for you,\\nit's better to discover it now\\nand not write the letter\\nthan to waste your time and theirs.\\n\\nAfter all, the goal isn't to write a lot of letters,\\nit's to write the right letters in the right way\\nto the right people\\nand of course, this is just one example.\\nYou won't always have such good source material\\nfor

lines,\\nreadings and closings frame the content,\\nand describes some ways to support the tone\\nthat you want to create.\\nTone is one place where there are some differences between\\nletters on paper, and letters through email.\\nPaper letters tend to be more formal.\\nFor example, a paper letter to me is likely to open with\\nDear Mr. Geller.\\n\\nBut in email it might simply start with Mr. Geller,\\nof even just Tom.\\nNow that extra formality for paper letters\\nis well-established.\\nBusiness letters from 50 years ago look a lot like\\nbusiness letters written on paper today.\\nBut emails from even 10 or 20 years ago\\nare quite different from those written today.\\nThe rules of style just haven't finished settling.\\nAnother difference is that paper letters look exactly\\nas you printed them.\\nYou can count on the letterhead and fonts\\nof a printed letter, but email looks different\\ndepending on the device, the operating system,\\nand the email program, so don't use such things\\nas graphics or bold text or fonts\\njust to get your tone across in email.\\n\\nNow in past years, there were lots of books about creating\\na formal tone through details such as punctuation\\nand address formatting,\\nbut I don't think they're worth discussing here\\nfor two reasons.\\nFirst, those details can vary in very subtle ways.\\nFor example, between Great Britain and the United States.\\nSecond, such details are easy to find online\\nby searching for, let's say, formal business letter.\\nOne site I like for such things is bab.la.\\nThe letter writing stuff is under the Phrases menu.\\n\\nThis site is also great for formal greetings and such\\nin other languages.\\nSo instead of details, let's look as some general matters\\nof tone in the greeting, body, and closing,\\nand in particular, for email.\\nOverall, you want your tone to reflect the relationship\\nthat you've already established.\\nSo if you usually call each other by first name in person,\\nfeel free to open your letter with dear Susan\\nor just Susan.\\nBut if it's the first time you're interacting,\\nsimple yet formal does the trick,\\nso either Ms. Smith or dear Ms. Smith is fine.\\n\\nNow the tricky part is when you don't know\\nyour correspondent's name.\\nYou could use a formula phrase such as\\nto whom in may concern, or dear sir or madam,\\nbut I personally find these a little too old-fashioned\\nfor email especially.\\nSlightly better is using the company name such as\\ndear Widget Factory, or the position's name\\nsuch as dear sales department.\\nOr in email, you can just leave the greeting off.\\nBut by and large, don't worry too much about the greeting.\\n\\nThe one thing that can hurt you\\nis if you make incorrect assumptions,\\nif you misspell someone's name, or call a doctor mister,\\nor misgender someone.\\nSo again, research before you write.\\nThat brings us to the body of the letter.\\nAgain, it should reflect your existing relationship,\\nor be simple yet formal if it's your first contact.\\nThat means avoiding such things as emoticons.\\nIn short, present yourself as you want to be seen,\\nkeeping in mind the ultimate goals of your letter.\\n\\nFinally, we come to the closing.\\nIn email the options are the same as for paper letters.\\nSincerely, best regards, and the like, they're all fine.\\nBut the closing is also a moment\\nwhen you can remind them of the next step,\\nso I often close emails with something like\\nlooking forward to your response.\\nThen, of course, add your email signature.\\nIn short, your letter doesn't stand alone.\\nIt's written in the context of your existing relationship,\\nand your goals, and how you want to be seen,\\nso let your tone reflect these contexts\\nto make your letter not just a statement,\\nbut part of a conversation.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:679085\",\"duration\":205,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Getting to the

seconds.\\nIt's from someone who's coming to town to meet you.\\nHere's one version.\\n\\nAnd here's the question:\\nwhen and where are you going to meet this person?\\nNow here's a second version,\\nand again, you'll only see it for five seconds.\\nAnd now the same question:\\nwhen and where are you going to meet this person?\\nThe answer is 5 p.m. on Wednesday at the train station.\\nDid you get it?\\nNow in the first version, chances are pretty good\\nyour eyes never even got to that information,\\nand even if they did, your brain was still struggling\\nto contextualize all of the other stuff\\nthat was mixed in there.\\n\\nBut it was right up front in the the second version,\\nwhich by the way, has exactly the same number of words\\nas the first version, and nearly the same information.\\nIt's just arranged a little differently.\\nAnd by the way, five seconds is pretty generous.\\nSeveral email marketing companies define a message\\nas read if it's only open for eight seconds.\\nThey call it skimmed if it's open for only two seconds.\\nSo you really have to grab that time.\\nSo how do you do that?\\nOur example demonstrated three ways.\\n\\nFirst, don't be coy about what you're writing.\\nPut your goal right up front.\\nYeah, sometimes an introductory sentence like\\nit was a pleasure to talk with you is necessary,\\nespecially if you're writing about a difficult topic,\\nlike getting paid.\\nBut keep it short.\\nSecond, remove confusing details.\\nNow in the first draft, we had\\nit was a pleasure to talk with you last Friday at 1 p.m.\\nAnd then we went on and mentioned\\na few other dates and times.\\nBut in the second draft, I moved Friday from the end\\nand got rid of the 1 p.m. entirely\\njust to avoid confusion.\\n\\nThird, rearrange the remainder of your text\\nto make it flow well.\\nThis is really an extension of putting your goal up front,\\nbut it's an important step,\\nbecause if all you do when you edit a letter\\nis to put that goal up front,\\nthere's a good chance that thoughts elsewhere\\nwill be left hanging.\\nAlso check the resulting punctuation and such,\\nbecause that sometimes gets mangled in the process.\\nThen I'd like to add another tip,\\neven though it didn't show up in our example.\\nCut out words.\\nBrevity is not only the soul of wit,\\nit's also how to say what you must\\nwithin those golden eight seconds.\\n\\nSo far, I've only talked about the body of the letter,\\nbut for email there's actually another place\\nwhere brevity and directness pay off, the subject line.\\nIn just a few words, it should say what's inside the email\\nand entice the recipient to open it and find out.\\nThe same rules apply for subject lines\\nas for the letter itself, be brief and direct,\\nand don't forget to proofread before hitting send.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:679086\",\"duration\":230,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Discussing difficult

There's no reason to be afraid\\nto address difficult topics,\\nsuch as complaints or demands.\\nThis video helps you make those interactions\\ncooperative efforts, rather than confrontations\\nand highlights the sandwich technique\\nto keep the discussion's tone positive.\\nLet's use a sadly common example.\\nWriting a letter to get paid for work\\nthat you already did.\\nHere's a short first draft of such a letter\\nwith several exaggerated, but common, errors.\\n\\\"You owe me money, and I'm really mad about it.\\n\\nI created graphics for your website\\nbut never got the payment you promised.\\nI think you were lying when you hired me.\\nYou never had the money to begin with.\\nI expect you to pay me as soon as possible\\nor I'll see you in court.\\\"\\nNow I know that if I got such a letter,\\nI'd want to fight them, not help them.\\nSo let's take a deep breath\\nand then look at how to make this cooperative\\ninstead of confrontational.\\nFirst of all, what good does it do\\nto say that you're mad?\\nSo we'll strike that part.\\n\\nIt also doesn't do any good to say\\n\\\"I think you were lying when you hired me.\\\"\\nAfter all, they might have just lost the invoice.\\nSo we'll strike that.\\nThen at the end we have this\\n\\\"I'll see you in court\\\" business.\\nExperienced business people only take\\nthis seriously when it's from an attorney.\\nIt doesn't add any real weight to your letter.\\nSo unless you're truly ready to lawyer up,\\nout it goes.\\nBut now we don't have much to our letter, do we?\\nLet's rewrite it with a more positive,\\nsolution-oriented attitude.\\n\\nThe first sentence is currently,\\n\\\"You owe me money. I created graphics for your website,\\nbut I never got the payment you promised.\\\"\\nWe can do better by providing details\\nthat your correspondent might simply not have.\\nLike so:\\n\\\"You contracted me to create graphics\\nthat now appear on your website.\\nPer our agreement, payment of $350\\nwas due on May 1st, but I unfortunately\\nstill haven't received it.\\\"\\nLet's also add details to the next sentence,\\nwhich says, \\\"I expect you to pay me\\nas soon as possible.\\\"\\nHow's this?\\n\\\"I've attached a copy of the invoice\\nthat I previously sent you on March 15th.\\n\\nI accept payment by check, direct deposit,\\nPayPal or Bitcoin.\\nDetails are in the invoice.\\\"\\nNow let's revisit that \\\"I'll see you in court\\\" text.\\nYou probably won't hire a lawyer to recover $350.\\nBut you do have other remedies at hand.\\nDon't be afraid to remind them of the consequences\\nas long as they're realistic.\\nSo, for example, \\\"I'm afraid I'll be unable\\nto do further work for you until I receive this payment.\\\"\\nSo now our letter is complete,\\nbut it's still a little harsh.\\n\\nSo I'd like to show you something called\\nthe sandwich technique to make it friendlier.\\nIn short, the difficult part goes right\\nin the middle, like the meat of a sandwich.\\nThen you put something pleasant\\nin the intro and the closing.\\nThey'll still get the message,\\nbut they won't feel as bad about it.\\nHere's an example opening that actually draws\\nfrom the rest of the letter.\\n\\\"It was a pleasure to work with you recently,\\ncreating graphics that I see are now on the website.\\nIt looks great.\\\"\\nThen I can remove that redundant part\\nin the middle and rearrange it a bit.\\n\\nAnd then the closing.\\n\\\"Thanks again for the opportunity to work together.\\nI look forward to continuing our productive\\nrelationship after this matter has been settled.\\\"\\nAnd that's it.\\nI think you'd agree that \\\"This is a small bump\\nin our excellent relationship,\\\"\\ncomes across a lot better than\\n\\\"You cheated me and I hate you,\\\" right?\\nOf course, the tone for your difficult letter\\nwill depend completely on your relationship\\nand what's gone before.\\nBut whatever the situation,\\nyou'll catch more flies with honey\\nthan with vinegar.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:679087\",\"duration\":262,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Writing for

Most writing advice is about making people\\nwant to read your writing,\\nso it's easy to forget that a large portion\\nof your audience simply can't understand your message\\nbecause of physical impairment,\\nlanguage difficulty or cultural issues.\\nNow, there's nothing you can do\\nabout your audience's abilities\\nbut there are ways to make your letters more accessible.\\nLet's first consider physical impairments.\\nPoor eyesight is the most obvious barrier to reading\\nbut neurological and muscular conditions\\ncan also cause problems.\\n\\nFor paper letters it's easy to control\\nthe presentation, so just be sure\\nthat clever design doesn't trump readability.\\nFor email, however, you don't know how your letter will look\\non the other side\\nbut the same advice holds true,\\nkeep the design simple.\\nIn particular, don't lean on fonts or design elements\\nto get your message across.\\nThey won't even show up on some email systems\\nsuch as screen readers for the blind\\nand on those that do,\\nsuch tricks can cause more problems than they solve.\\n\\nThat goes double for attachments\\nsuch as PDFs or Word documents.\\nThe other big barrier to reading is language.\\nEven in the United States\\nfully 20% of the population speaks a language\\nother than English at home\\nand plenty of successful business people\\nare weak in the language.\\nYou can help them by consciously simplifying your language.\\nHere are some examples.\\nOur first example uses two multi-word verbs,\\nalso known as phrasal verbs.\\nThese are notoriously hard to understand\\nbecause the individual words\\ndon't add up as expected.\\n\\nConsider, looked over is very different\\nfrom overlooked and breaking a sentence down\\nis very different from a car breaking down.\\nConvert these phrasal verbs\\nto one word verbs wherever possible.\\nThe second example is a complicated\\nand ambiguous tense.\\nWhen you say I had been hoping to meet,\\nit's not actually clear whether you still want to meet.\\nEnglish has a lot of such tenses.\\nMake sure you're using the clearest and simplest one.\\nFinally, we have little apple, little egg.\\n\\nOh, you don't know that one?\\nIt's a very common expression\\nif you speak Dutch.\\nJust as you probably don't know it,\\nan expression like his idea\\nwas out of left field won't work for many people\\nespecially if they know nothing about baseball.\\nWatch out for such sayings\\nwhere like those phrasal verbs\\nthe individual words don't actually add up\\nto the full meaning.\\nBy the way, little apple, little egg in Dutch\\nmeans that something is easy to do.\\n(man speaks in foreign language)\\nBut all of these communication problems disappear\\nif you can write in the language of your corespondent\\nbut then the question is should you?\\nAre you sure that you know their language\\nbetter than they know yours?\\nWill you be able to understand their response?\\nAnd will the correspondence need to be read\\nby someone else, maybe someone\\nwho doesn't speak that language.\\n\\nBeyond words, watch out for standards that differ\\namong countries and cultures.\\nTake for example the sentence\\ncall me at seven on 6/7 at 06 9359 4835.\\nThere are four opportunities for error here.\\nFirst, does that mean 7 a.m. or 7 p.m?\\nIn what time zone?\\nIs 6/7 June 7th or July 6th?\\nDo I have to dial a country code?\\nWhen in doubt, write it out,\\nso try this instead.\\n\\nCall me at 7 p.m. Central European Time\\non July 6th at +31, that's the country code,\\n6 9359 4835.\\nBut above all, remember this,\\nregardless of whether communication\\nis hindered by physical, linguistic or cultural causes,\\nconcise writing is always easier to read.\\nThink of it this way,\\nsome readers have to struggle through each word,\\neach phrase, each sentence,\\nso the fewer there are,\\nthe less they have to struggle.\\n\\nAt the same time,\\nthere's no need to change your tone or content,\\nonly their communication is hindered,\\nnot their intelligence\\nor the opportunities for you\\nto build a positive relationship.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"2.

Sadly, even well-prepared letters often go unanswered.\\nThis video examines what to do\\nwhen busy correspondents fail to respond.\\nIt also considers options outside of the\\nletter-writing sphere, allowing you to re-start\\nthe relationship in a way that gets you what you want.\\nYour first recourse is to simply send a reminder letter\\nafter a reasonable amount of time has passed.\\nBut that raises the question: How long is\\na reasonable amount of time?\\nSadly, there's no hard and fast rule.\\n\\nWrite too early and they'll think you're\\nannoying and pesky, wait too long\\nand you could miss an opportunity.\\nSo you'll have to use your judgment,\\nand here are a few factors to consider.\\nYou can remember them with the acronym TAP.\\nFirst the T: What is your timeline?\\nFor example, if you're preparing a booth\\nfor a big event on September 1st, and you have to\\nplan your travel by August 1st, it would be\\nreasonable to prod them for necessary information in July.\\n\\nSecond, the A: Do alternatives exist?\\nAre there other places you can turn to for satisfaction?\\nIf so, is a second letter even worth your time?\\nThird, the P: Will an appearance of peskiness\\ndamage your relationship?\\nSome communications are relatively impersonal,\\nso you don't care as much what your\\ncorrespondent thinks of you.\\nThere's no real cost to writing them again,\\nso you might as well do it.\\nBut for situations that require more tact,\\nperhaps wait a bit longer.\\n\\nSo, let's say you've decided to write a follow up.\\nThe same rules apply here as for all letters\\nabout difficult subjects.\\nDon't argue, don't assume malice.\\nGive specifics and make resolution easy.\\nRemember, there's a good chance they simply\\nnever got your earlier message.\\nHere's a basic text:\\nI'm afraid I didn't get a response to my letter\\nof June 15th about our booth space at your convention.\\nA fast reply would be appreciated,\\nas we're trying to finalize our travel plans.\\n\\nThank you.\\nNow that's just the core.\\nOf course you'll add your own details.\\nDefinitely include the earlier conversation\\nin your follow up.\\nNow for email, that's easy.\\nJust find the last email in the thread and\\nhit Reply or Reply to All.\\nCheck the To line before sending, though,\\nbecause if you wrote the last email,\\nyou might accidentally only send the follow-up\\nmessage to yourself.\\nOr you could try this, instead of sending a\\nfollow-up letter, try contacting them through\\nsome other means, such as by phone.\\n\\nHere again, there are no absolute rules of\\nwhen it's best to do this, you just have to feel it out.\\nBut I would like to suggest a rule for\\nletters sent online.\\nDon't follow up through multiple online venues.\\nIf someone doesn't answer your emailed letter,\\nand it's truly important, it's probably fine\\nto send an InMail on Linkedin to ask did you get my letter.\\nBut don't also follow up with their Twitter and\\nFacebook and Instagram pages, it's just too much.\\nAnd certainly don't follow up on their non-work\\nsocial media accounts, that's a real bad one.\\n\\nNow let's say you've given up on your contact,\\nbut you really need satisfaction for an important matter.\\nYou have a difficult decision.\\nDo you write to someone else in the company?\\nHere again, I would apply the TAP rules.\\nCheck your timeline, alternatives and peskiness cost.\\nThat last one is especially important, as you could\\nbe inciting bad feeling among colleagues.\\nI think it's often a good idea to include something\\nlike: I previously discussed this with so and so,\\nbut I haven't heard from them lately.\\n\\nAgain, use your judgment.\\nReminder letters set up an implicitly confrontational\\nsituation because you're effectively pointing out\\nsomething that they failed to do.\\nBut if you gauge your own need to follow up\\nand handle the matter politely, time spent\\nwriting follow-up letters can pay off handsomely.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:679090\",\"duration\":141,\"visible\":false,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":null,\"name\":\"Continuing the

are we looking at?\\\"\\nFive Dreaded words you Don't Want to hear After putting hours into\\ncrunching numbers to present to company executives.\\nToday, I'm going to help you avoid making five mistakes when\\npresenting data.\\ndata at a glance,\\nallowing you to seize every opportunity to impress them and\\ntell the story behind your data points.\\nThe first mistake is the most common, presenting the raw\\ndata instead of a chart.\\nA big wall of numbers is hard to understand quickly. To\\nfix this mistake,\\nthink about what the executives need to know.\\n\\nIn this example, they don't need to\\nsee all the data.\\nThey need to know if sales are above goal.\\nVisualizing the data with a simple bar chart will show that fast.\\nThe second mistake is a rushed approach.\\nThe less time you take in revising your charts,\\nthe more time the executives need to understand them.\\nSo put the time in before you present. Using shorter headlines,\\nsimpler colors, and cleaner charts make a big difference.\\nThe third mistake is using default charts.\\nPowerPoint, for example, has a feature called SmartArt.\\n\\nIt can insert a chart like this funnel visual that seems to\\nbe useful for showing, say, the steps a customer takes\\nbefore buying a product.\\nBut this funnel doesn't represent the data.\\nIt's not to scale, meaning the smaller numbers should\\nappear as much smaller parts of this funnel.\\nA quick fix is to replace this default chart with a standard\\naccurate chart like a bar chart.\\nThis allows your audience to quickly see the lowest and highest\\npoints of progression for a customer's visit to a website\\nand making a purchase.\\nThis fourth mistake is a big one, burying the story.\\n\\nThink of your chart like a newspaper article.\\nDoes the headline say what's most important?\\nDoes the biggest visual\\nshow the biggest point?\\nIf you answer no, then you may have buried the real\\nstory under too many words and visuals.\\nDig out.\\nShout that story in the headline.\\nReinforce the story with your biggest visual.\\nIn this instance, the revenue is a big story for\\nsuperstores email campaigns.\\nThe final mistake is an easy one to make.\\nA highly detailed chart is better for analysts,\\nnot executives.\\nI always tell analysts to make data visualizations that\\nmake your job easier.\\n\\nIf unusual charts and intricate colors help you find the insights,\\ngreat.\\nBut when communicating these insights,\\nyou'll need to transform them into a chart that is more digestible.\\nBy making clarity the top goal when visualizing data,\\nyou can avoid these mistakes.\\nA great tip is to imagine that you are seeing the raw data\\nfor the first time.\\nThis will help you to make clear, presentable insights for your\\nconversations with executives.\\nAnd the more you practice, the quicker you'll spot\\nthese mistakes.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2702570\",\"duration\":146,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Problems with

data.\\nIf you and your executives team still love them,\\nthen make sure you're using them correctly.\\nIn today's lesson, I'll walk you through why pie\\ncharts are at the bottom of my list when presenting data and\\nhow to properly use them.\\n\\nWhen you picture an actual pie, you'll quickly see the issues\\nwith pie charts.\\nyou know which one is the biggest, right?\\nAnd what if you cut it into ten pieces of various sizes?\\nTelling the difference in slices gets a lot harder.\\nWhat if you put a second pie next to that first one and cut that\\nsecond pie in a lot of pieces?\\nComparing slices can get nearly impossible.\\nThat same issue happens with pie charts.\\nA person's brain just isn't good at calculating how big slices are\\nand comparing slices to other slices.\\n\\nIf you took geometry, you might remember the formula\\nfor the area of a circle, which is pie times the\\nradius squared.\\nAdmittedly, I don't remember that either.\\nAfter looking it up, one thing is very clear, the\\nformula is based on the angles of each pie segment,\\nwhich can quickly become complicated.\\nAnd the more slices, the more impossible everything\\nbecomes.\\nyou can use these two solutions to present clear data.\\nFirst, I encourage you to choose an alternative visual aid.\\n\\nRevisiting the field of geometry no matter the size of a rectangle,\\neven when it's inside of a larger rectangle,\\nthe formula for the area will always be length times width.\\nThis is a formula every person can do in looking at a rectangle\\nversus a circle.\\nconsider using a bar chart,\\na line chart instead.\\nIt will still do the work of a pie chart and is quickly understood\\nby executives.\\nIf you must use a pie chart, keep it simple.\\nYou'll want to limit the number of slices in your data set,\\nmake sure one slice is bigger than the others.\\n\\nKeep the colors distinct from one another, and provide clear labels.\\nThis will ensure that you quickly show the data that executives\\nneed to know.\\nPie charts; show only a few slices or switch to a bar type chart.\\nThese solutions will keep your data clear,\\nhelpful, and understandable as you elevate your data presentations.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:4469635\",\"duration\":124,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Metrics that

executives in your audience.\\nIn this lesson, I'll walk you through creating a\\nhierarchy for your metrics so that your message is quickly\\nunderstood.\\nThis KPI chart currently shows nine typical metrics for an\\ne-commerce company, such as the time a person spends\\non a website and the amount of transactions versus a year ago.\\nAnd while you're eager to present your hard work,\\nit's more important to be direct when meeting with executives.\\n\\nBy the end of this video, you'll see which ones matter the\\nmost by first asking, \\\"What metric is the most important?\\\"\\nYou'll need to focus on what your leaders prioritize.\\nIn this case, it's sales growth.\\nSo then your answer is the year to year chain in sales.\\nThis should be the most prominent metric in your presentation and\\ntherefore deserves the largest, boldest font.\\nNow move on to the next most important metric.\\nThe answer will vary for this fictitious e-commerce company,\\nis the conversion rate, meaning of all the people who\\nvisited your website, how many of them bought something?\\nTo properly emphasize it as a secondary takeaway,\\nplace it under the sales metric.\\n\\nFrom there, the question is still, \\\"What is the next most important\\nmetric after that?\\\"\\nBut the answers are more nuanced.\\nThat's where you can let your expertise shine through.\\nHere, if you know that sales are driven by units sold and the\\namount a customer pays per order, then place those metrics\\nnext to sales.\\nNot as big and bold as sales, though, these metrics are\\nin a supporting role.\\nFinally, you can ask, \\\"Are these last metrics even important\\nat all?\\\"\\nI like to use a label that says deeper metrics.\\n\\nThey give context but don't directly drive the most\\nimportant metrics.\\nAnd if the metric isn't important, that's simpler still, don't include\\nit in this executive view.\\nThese four questions will help you create clearer presentations.\\nSo take a look at an upcoming presentation,\\ncan you find a way to limit the metrics you're sharing?\\nTake the time to do that, and you'll be surprised how fast the\\nexecutives will respond to your great work.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:2702569\",\"duration\":206,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Fast

felt that pressure too\\nwhen the big meeting is in one day, one hour, or even one minute.\\nIn this lesson, I'll give you five fast fixes that will help you make\\nyour charts ready for that meeting when time is very tight.\\n\\nIf you literally only have one minute,\\nthe fastest way to make your chart better is to highlight one part.\\nLet's look at this example, a chart called Consistent\\nStore Sales Growth.\\nThis is way too much data to go through in a meeting.\\nAnd on top of that, it's overwhelming to look at.\\nBut if you could highlight one thing,\\nwhat would it be?\\nAha.\\nThe south region has the best average growth at 46%.\\nHighlight that by circling it greying out everything else,\\nwhatever is possible in 60 seconds.\\nThis quickly has clarity and a focal point for your audience.\\n\\nWith a little more time,\\neven if it's just a minute or two more,\\nwrite a good headline.\\nThis headline will grab the attention of the executives and it\\nwill give them guidance on what to look at in this chart.\\nHere the headline, \\\"South Region Leads in Average Monthly Sales\\nGrowth\\\" is a quick solution.\\nIt reinforces why you've highlighted the South and explains\\nwhat this chart is showing.\\nWhat if you had one hour?\\nIt will still fly by, but it does give you time to\\nconsider improving the chart itself.\\nThis chart type is a bar chart with the categories and rows,\\nbut a bar chart with categories and columns is much better\\nfor this data set.\\n\\nMany software programs like Tableau and even Excel allow you\\nto change the chart with a click or two. Try a few options to see\\nwhat improves the chart's\\nclarity.\\nIn this sales chart, I was able to move the\\nregions the south, central, west and east.\\nWhen they were on the left hand side,\\nthe bars were very flat and once I moved the regions to the top,\\nthe differences are much easier to spot.\\nAnd since you have an hour, you can also adjust the color.\\nThe colors you use are a major factor in how easy it is to\\nunderstand the chart.\\n\\nLuckily, colors are also quick to change.\\nIn the original version of the sales chart example,\\nall the bars were blue.\\nWhat was good, and what was bad?\\nThat's hard to tell.\\nBy adjusting the colors at a glance,\\nothers can tell what is good, green, and what is bad, red.\\nOkay, now that you learned about fast fixes in one minute or one hour,\\nlet's say you had one whole day. Without much time before\\nthe big meeting,\\nyou can take a breath and consider the best fix of all,\\nturning a data chart into a data story.\\nIn the sales chart, that extra time allows for a\\nmore extensive redesign.\\n\\nI found that showing trends and totals,\\nnot just the percent changes can reveal the story.\\nThat was the case here.\\nWhile the South had the best average sales growth,\\nit's really the West that's contributing the most.\\nAnd to show that story,\\nyou can update the headlines and visuals,\\nproducing a chart that has a West data points leading the story.\\nThe next time you have only one minute,\\none hour or one day till the big meeting,\\ndon't stress.\\nRemember these fast fixes of highlighting headlines,\\nchart types, color, and story.\\nIf you'd like to spend more time reviewing these fast fixes,\\nI've included them in the exercise files.\\n\\nAnd the next time your boss calls you in a panic,\\nyou'll be able to calmly make your charts a lot better,\\na lot faster.\\nYou've got this.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

to business writing,\\nyou might be thinking,\\n\\\"I've seen some AI writing and well, it's not that good.\\\"\\nAI can produce great writing if we ask the right questions.\\nIt can provide us with feedback for growth\\nand automate many tasks.\\nSo, if you want to learn how AI\\ncan be the writing coach you've always wanted,\\nyou're in the right place.\\n\\nLet's start with a definition.\\nGenerative AI is artificial intelligence\\nthat creates new content,\\nfor example, a business report or a summary.\\nBut to get good output, we need good input.\\nAs they say, garbage in, garbage out.\\nThis is where prompt engineering comes in.\\nDon't worry if that sounds overwhelming,\\nwe'll break it down and help you master this skill.\\nSo in this course,\\nwe're going to combine the power of generative AI\\nwith key points in the Write It Well\\nbusiness writing process\\nto get the best results.\\n\\nHere's the planning process.\\nStep one, focus on the reader,\\nstep two, identify your reader's questions,\\nstep three, determine your purpose for writing,\\nstep four, identify your main point,\\nand step five, organize the content, draft, and edit.\\nFirst, with help from AI, we'll focus on your reader.\\nWe'll ask AI to generate a list of questions\\nwe ought to consider\\nso that we can structure the document\\naround what the reader cares about,\\nnot just what you want to tell them.\\n\\nThen, we'll need to determine the purpose for writing.\\nAre you writing to inform someone about something\\nor influencing them to take action?\\nNext, we'll identify the main point\\nand answer the reader's questions.\\nMoving on, with the reader's questions\\nand our writing purpose in mind,\\nAI can help us organize and outline the document,\\ndraft, and finally, edit.\\nWe can use AI to make the first draft visually appealing\\nand easier to read\\nby asking for formatting improvements, like bullet points,\\nand turning long paragraphs into short ones.\\n\\nAdditionally, AI will fix or improve our sentences\\nto preserve and enhance\\nour professional image and credibility.\\nAI will eliminate all the unnecessary words and phrases\\nso that it's easier for readers to skim and scan.\\nAnd not only can AI tighten up the language\\nand fix grammar and punctuation problems,\\nit can also help us identify\\nour biggest opportunities for learning.\\nIf you want to go deeper\\non the writing planning process I've just outlined,\\ncheck out my other course,\\nwhich offers more detail on the Write It Well

Let me ask you a question.\\nWould you prefer to read a document\\nwith long, dense paragraphs\\nor one that has lists, headings, subheadings,\\nor even just shorter paragraphs?\\nMy guess is that you'd prefer the one\\nwith text that is broken up.\\nWhy is that?\\nWell, lists are easier to read\\nand process than paragraphs.\\nThey're also very effective for writing out directions.\\nThere are two types of lists\\nthat you can ask chatGPT to use,\\nnumbered lists and bulleted lists.\\nWhen you use numbered lists, the items show varying levels\\nof priority or specific sequences.\\n\\nOn the other hand, bulleted lists imply\\nthat each of the items are equal in their importance\\nor are not in a particular order.\\nAnother tool, headings,\\nare titles or subtitles that force you to group related bits\\nof information to guide the reader through your document.\\nHeadings and subheadings also should give the reader\\na high level summary of the content\\nthey'll find in the section.\\nThink about writing headlines the same way\\nyou'd write a compelling email subject line.\\n\\nUse dynamic verbs.\\nFor instance, a call to action might be,\\n\\\"Join our collaborative workshop.\\\"\\nThese types of headlines\\nmake the action and purpose clear to the reader.\\nFinally, short paragraphs\\nare about two or three sentences long,\\nand they're better than long paragraphs\\nbecause the reader can skim them faster and easier.\\nLucas, AKA, the real estate analyst,\\nis going to show us how to take a long, dense paragraph\\nand use AI to break the content into snackable pieces,\\nmaking it easier to read.\\n\\n- [Lucas] In front of us here,\\nyou can see an example of a dense paragraph\\nthat chatGPT wrote for me.\\nThis paragraph really needs work\\nbecause it's difficult to pick out essential information.\\nHowever, we can apply the three formatting skills\\nin our toolkit to improve our writing.\\nTo begin, let's add onto this and ask,\\nplease turn this paragraph into a numbered list.\\nEach item on the list should be a full sentence\\nand become less important, the higher the number.\\n\\nStart each sentence with a verb.\\nRemember, chatGPT cannot read our minds\\nor understand exactly what it is we're looking for,\\nso providing more direction is always better.\\nWow, I must say, that is much easier to read.\\nThis type of formatting can be time-consuming\\nto produce on our own time,\\nbut is extremely easy and efficient when chatGPT\\ncan do it for us in just seconds.\\nNext, we'll use headers and subheaders\\nto break up the dense text.\\n\\nWhen dealing with longer documents,\\nheaders and subheaders are sometimes a better option.\\nA great example is a research paper\\nwhere we have many different sections\\nthat we want to make visible and clear for the reader\\nto pick apart information.\\nSo we'll bring in the original paragraph and state,\\n\\\"Please break up this paragraph\\nby adding headings and subheadings.\\\"\\nThe headings should state the main point of each paragraph,\\nand subheadings should do the same for subpoints.\\n\\nAgain, we give chatGPT clear instructions\\nbecause we understand it cannot read our minds.\\nWe'll send this message, and see what it'll give us.\\nWow, I must say, again, great job chatGPT.\\nThis final one here, diversification strategy\\nand risk management with two excellent subpoints.\\nImagine if a reader really wants to know\\nabout portfolio diversification.\\nIn this case, they can jump straight to it.\\n\\nThey don't need to pick through this dense paragraph,\\nbut hey, if you don't want to use numbered lists\\nor headings or subheadings,\\nwe can always go for trusted old bullet points.\\nAgain, we'll bring in our original paragraph,\\nbut this time our prompt will be,\\n\\\"Please break this paragraph into bullet points\\nof main points and ideas with roughly equal importance.\\\"\\nWe'll paste that in there and let's see what we get.\\nWow.\\n\\nYet again, chatGPT, right away,\\nwe have clear bullet points such as costs were reduced\\nby 10% through technology investments.\\nThis is so much easier to understand\\nthan if we give our readers a real dense paragraph.\\nNot to mention chatGPT really does do this seamlessly.\\nWhat a great skill\\nand what a

notes I took for a meeting.\\nI'm really pressed for time,\\nand I don't want to send out something\\nthat does not even resemble my own work,\\nespecially since my audience is accustomed\\nto my notes and summaries in my writing style.\\nThis is a more involved method with a much longer prompt,\\nbut I'm going to combine the notes I took during the meeting\\nwith my writing sample\\nto produce something closer to my own style.\\n\\nSo to do that, I'll paste in this prompt here.\\nStarting from the top,\\nyou'll see I have the notes I took from the meeting.\\nSome of them include a reference\\nto the impact of deforestation on climate change\\nand the importance of water conservation methods\\nand their significance.\\nIn the middle is the nitty gritty of my prompt.\\nWe'll say, \\\"Above are my notes from a meeting I just had.\\\"\\nWe are making sure that ChatGPT specifically understands\\nthe different components of our prompt,\\nespecially for longer ones like this.\\n\\nWe'll tell it,\\n\\\"I need to turn them into a one-paragraph summary\\n\\\"in my own style.\\\"\\nAgain, as always, we are being clear and specific\\nwith what we want ChatGPT to do for us.\\nAnd, finally, we'll say,\\n\\\"Below is an example of my own writing style for reference.\\\"\\nLet's send this message and see what we get.\\nI want to say as well that this is a great tactic\\nand, since it's a longer prompt,\\nit doesn't always perform exactly how we want it to,\\nso feel free to iterate\\nuntil you get a prompt that works for you.\\n\\nWhen we scroll down,\\nwe'll see that ChatGPT did what we wanted.\\nHow incredible is that?\\nFor example, it'll say in the first sentence,\\n\\\"In today's meeting,\\n\\\"we delved into a plethora of crucial topics\\n\\\"surrounding sustainability and environmental conservation.\\\"\\nJust to make it clear,\\nI didn't have time to take great notes from this meeting,\\nbut as I'm sure you will,\\nthis will make ChatGPT's output far superior.\\nSecond, we can combine our prompting techniques\\nwith a list of adjectives that describe our style\\nand ask for the output that way.\\n\\nIf you're struggling to come up with a list of your own,\\nyou can always ask ChatGPT\\nto identify your style with a given writing sample.\\nAs always, the more the better,\\nso the more adjectives, in this case, the better.\\nIn this instance,\\nI'm going to use seven adjectives\\nto help ChatGPT write those same notes\\ninto my writing style.\\nAgain, to go over our prompt here,\\nwe have our notes in the top,\\nand, in this case, I've removed my writing sample\\nand substituted it for these adjectives.\\n\\nLet's send it in there and see what we get.\\nThe adjectives that I've decided describe my writing style\\nare descriptive, analytical,\\nreflective, thoughtful, engaging, persuasive, and balanced.\\nI believe I got the majority of these from ChatGPT\\nby providing it with that original writing sample\\nthat we showed you before.\\nAgain, here ChatGPT is able to do this.\\nThis no longer sounds as robotic as it did before.\\nTo read this final sentence,\\nit'll say, \\\"Furthermore, we acknowledge\\n\\\"the indispensable role\\n\\\"of government policies and regulations\\n\\\"in fostering sustainability initiatives\\n\\\"in alignment with sustainable development goals\\n\\\"and the concerted efforts\\n\\\"of communities and grassroots initiatives\\n\\\"in propelling meaningful progress\\n\\\"towards a more sustainable future.\\\"\\nAs you can see, even by providing these adjectives,\\nChatGPT was able to modify its output\\nand write something closer to our individual writing style.\\n\\nWe always recommend\\nproviding some actual writing to guide ChatGPT,\\nbut, in a

I have an example writing project.\\nI'm going to be using AI to submit a draft\\nfor an employee engagement plan\\nfor a national construction company.\\nBut now is a great time for you to give this a try.\\nSo feel free to select a writing project of your own,\\nand let's do it.\\nTo start with, we will decode our reader\\nbecause it helps us understand what our content\\nshould be focused on, since, as always,\\nwe're writing for our readers, not ourselves.\\n\\nWe can start with a prompt like this one here.\\nI'll say, \\\"I'm drafting a proposal\\nfor an employee engagement plan at a construction company.\\\"\\nAs always, we start with clear context.\\nRemember, more is better here.\\nWhen I say, \\\"Can you help me identify my audience,\\nand for each major player,\\nlist five of their potential top concerns?\\\"\\nit gives the AI clear direction\\nabout what exactly it is I'm looking for.\\nAs you see in our output here,\\nwe have the executive management team,\\nhuman resources department, and a few more,\\nalong with some of their most important interests.\\n\\nHere, we combined clear instructions\\nto yield a very helpful list of our audience\\nand their concerns.\\nRemember, as I mentioned, the more context you provide,\\nthe more specific and helpful the responses\\nfrom ChatGPT will be.\\nNext, I'm going to define my purpose and main point.\\nThese for me are to inform the employees of the new plan\\nand to relay that we are safely returning\\nto a three day, in-office,\\ntwo-day, work-from-home hybrid model.\\nNow, I'm going to add a supporting source\\nand some statistics to get a better draft from ChatGPT\\nand to enhance my credibility.\\n\\nI happen to know this article I'm reading\\ncomplements my plan.\\nThat being said, I'm crunch for time here,\\nso I'm not going to read through line by line\\nto extract all the important information.\\nSo I'm going to use our skills from the research movie\\nto grab the most important statistics\\nand some context to improve my draft.\\nAs we showed, I'll be highlighting everything.\\nI'll be copying it and pasting it into ChatGPT.\\nThen I'll add this prompt.\\n\\nHere, I'll say, \\\"Please give me the five\\nmost important statistics from this article\\nalong with their context and an APA citation at the end.\\\"\\nIn this case, I don't just want to know the statistic.\\nI want to know where it comes from,\\nbecause just giving a statistic without context\\nmakes it very difficult for the reader\\nto understand what's happening.\\nNext, we'll put all the ingredients together in the pot,\\nour decoded reader output, that's the audience\\nand their concerns, the summary statistics,\\nthe purpose, and the main point.\\n\\nTo do this, we'll copy everything that ChatGPT\\nhas given us before, and we'll add this new prompt\\nthat I'm adding in here.\\nAs you'll see, starting from the top,\\nI have those readers' interests there.\\nThen I have the statistics right about here.\\n\\\"73% of employers would consider leaving their jobs\\nfor the right offer,\\neven if they weren't actively job hunting.\\\"\\nOur prompt will say,\\n\\\"Above is a list of my readers' concerns.\\nI want to create an outline for an employee engagement plan\\nthat focuses on these concerns.\\\"\\nAgain, we're making it explicitly clear\\nwhat information we're providing\\nand what we want ChatGPT to do with that information.\\n\\nFurthermore, we'll say, \\\"Included are some statistics\\nthat I want to incorporate in the plan.\\nThe purpose is to inform, and the main point is to explain\\nour three-day in-office, two-day,\\nwork-from-home hybrid work policy.\\nPlease create an outline for a three paragraph document\\nthat addresses all the information above.\\\"\\nThis prompt incorporates all steps of our writing process.\\nThis will return good output\\nbecause we clearly described what we had in the chat\\nand what we're looking for.\\nAs you can see, we have a comprehensive outline\\nfrom construction managers and supervisors,\\nfrontline construction workers,\\nand finally, we've even added a conclusion.\\n\\nTo take this one step further,\\nwe'll take our next prompt here,\\nwhich is going to help us get a draft.\\nThis prompt will say, \\\"Please turn this\\ninto a three paragraph rough draft for me.\\nI want the draft to be clear and concise, about 300 words.\\nI want the tone to be professional,\\nfriendly, and optimistic.\\nFinally, please include a word bank list at the bottom\\nthat I could use to proofread\\nand improve my vocabulary here.\\\"\\nNot only are we trying to set a tone\\nand clear parameters for our draft,\\nbut we're even taking it one step further\\nand asking ChatGPT to provide us ways\\nto improve upon our writing.\\n\\nLet's see what we get.\\nWow, as always, ChatGPT is really here to help us out\\nand turn us into better writers\\nby being a fantastic writing coach.\\nWe have a great rough draft to work with\\nand a word bank list.\\nWell, there you have it, a workshop from start to finish\\nand a much better output overall.\\nTaking the time to develop each element one by one\\nallows us to get the most impact out of AI,\\nor should I say, the most flavor out of our sauce.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5912018\",\"duration\":160,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Accelerate your writing: AI shortcuts and

phrase.\\nFor example, here in Word, I'll type...\\nNow, because I'm working in Word,\\nit has its own spelling and grammar checker,\\nbut it's not as advanced as Grammarly's.\\nSo I'm going to turn those features off,\\nand this way, we can just see\\nwhat Grammarly is trying to show us.\\n\\nSo there's some obvious errors here\\nthat Grammarly has underlined.\\nGrammarly uses different color underlines\\nto indicate different types of errors or suggestions.\\nRed indicates things like grammar, spelling,\\nand punctuation issues.\\nNow, you can spot check and correct individual areas\\nby rolling your mouse over the underlined word.\\nIf it's a misspelling like this one,\\nyou'll see the suggested correct spelling.\\nIf the word is actually correct, you can click Dismiss\\nto have Grammarly unmarked it as an error and ignore it,\\nor you can click it to make the change.\\n\\nNow, as Grammarly starts to better understand the meaning\\nof what you're writing, you may see the underlines\\nturn from red to blue or another color.\\nBlue underlines indicate clarity issues.\\nAnother way to check your writing\\nand review what Grammarly has identified\\nis to click its widget.\\nThe number in the widget indicates\\nhow many issues Grammarly has noticed.\\nSo that opens this window,\\nwhich lists all the issues Grammarly has noticed.\\nSo we can click on each one of these.\\nThis one is telling me to correct the entire sentence,\\nand it offers a suggestion.\\n\\nThis one is saying Less wordy,\\nand this one's telling me to choose a different word.\\nSo instead of really hungry, it's suggesting starving.\\nSo again, if you agree with one\\nof its suggestions, just click Accept.\\nNow, notice at the bottom of this panel,\\nwe have areas for correctness,\\nclarity, engagement, and delivery.\\nThe lines that you see here indicate\\nhow strong that category is.\\nSo you can see we have checks for engagement and delivery.\\n\\nSo there are no suggestions in those categories,\\nbut correctness and clarity needs some work.\\nBut again, as we make our changes,\\nGrammarly is constantly checking your work.\\nSo even though we accepted those changes,\\nit's not giving me this purple underline telling me\\nthat I could rewrite this sentence for clarity.\\nSo it's telling me, in this case,\\nto get rid of the they here.\\nSo I'll just Rewrite for clarity.\\n\\nAnd now, it giving me the all clear.\\nOf course, you'll always want to check the work yourself\\nand make sure it's still makes sense on the page for you.\\nAnd just to quickly look at another example,\\nI'll switch over to TextEdit\\nwhere I have another document open.\\nAnd again, you can see some blue underlines\\nand some red underlines.\\nAnd here I can see that it has 14 suggestions.\\nNotice when I click on it, we see different colors appear.\\nWe have some green underlines in this case.\\nNow, green underlines often appear when Grammarly\\nhas suggestions for a different word\\nor phrasing for what you've written.\\n\\nSo in this case, it's suggesting\\ninstead of using the phrase really good,\\nwe could choose perfect,\\nand it also gives us some other options here.\\nI could choose excellent or outstanding.\\nThen click Accept to make that change.\\nThe fourth color you might see is purple,\\nwhich has to do with what Grammarly calls delivery,\\nmeaning the tone and attitude of what you've written.\\nNow, in this case, I don't actually agree with this.\\nThis is a sentence fragment.\\nIt's not a complete sentence,\\nbut it's saying it is giving or it was giving.\\n\\nBut I'm going to just dismiss this one.\\nBut again, we can just work our way\\nthrough all those suggestions, checking them,\\nand if we like them, we can click Accept.\\nSo again, just make your way through,\\nlooking at each one of these suggestions\\nand deciding whether you want to use\\nwhat Grammarly is suggesting.\\nNow, as I continue to refine the document,\\nGrammarly is now giving me this green underline\\nthat has these three dots at the end,\\nindicating that this suggestion\\nis about more than just the first couple\\nof underlined words.\\n\\nNotice it's rewriting and expanding\\na lot of the information within this paragraph.\\nSo again, I want to make sure to read through this.\\nIf it looks good to me, I can click

[Instructor] When you're writing anything from essays\\nto reports to professional emails,\\nthe tone you use is an important factor.\\nYour tone conveys your attitude or emotional perspective\\nand shapes how the reader perceives the content.\\nThe right tone can make your writing\\nmore relatable and engaging.\\nConversely, the wrong tone can misrepresent your intent\\nor undermine your credibility\\nor the trust the reader has in you.\\nGrammarly has a built-in tone detector\\nthat can give you a sense of how what you've written\\nmay come across to others.\\nLet's take a look at how it works\\nand also look at a few ways Grammarly can help you change\\nor improve the tone of your writing.\\n\\nSo I have here an email to Miranda\\nthat I've pasted into a text document.\\nYou can see that as usual,\\nGrammarly has already underlined some parts of it\\nthat it thinks it could use some improvement.\\nAnd again, we can look more closely at each underlined item\\nby clicking the Grammarly widget.\\nSo for example, I can see here at the bottom of this list\\nthat it's suggesting we get rid of the word really.\\nNow you can click the info button next to any suggestion\\nto get a more detailed explanation\\nof why Grammarly is making the suggestion.\\nIn this case, you can see that it's telling us\\nthat using words like basically, actually,\\nand for all intents and purposes\\nare considered filler phrases and make the sentence wordy\\nwithout contributing any important information.\\n\\nAnd it gives us a couple examples below.\\nSo again, I can go back here and click rephrase\\nto get rid of that word and follow that suggestion.\\nNow to see the tone detector,\\nwe click the emoji in the upper left hand corner.\\nCurrently you need to have at least 150 words\\nin your document for the tone detector to activate.\\nAnd we're seeing here that it's telling us this email\\nmight sound optimistic, friendly, and admiring.\\n\\nSo the tone detector analyzes a combination\\nof your word choices, phrasing, punctuation,\\nand even capitalization to determine the way in which\\nwhat you've written may be perceived by a reader.\\nSo if the adjectives you see here are a good representation\\nof how you intend to come across,\\nthen you probably did well.\\nBut if these don't really describe your intention\\nfor your writing, you may want to take a closer look\\nat what you've written and how you've written it.\\nNow, do note that it does say beta up here,\\nmeaning the tone detector\\nis still being worked and improved.\\n\\nYou can help Grammarly by clicking the check button\\nnext to an accurate description\\nor the minus button if you don't think it applies.\\nFor example, I don't really think the tone\\nof this email is admiring,\\nso I'll click the minus button next to it.\\nAnd that gives me a menu I can choose from\\nand I'll select tone detected incorrectly.\\nNow, in some cases you may see a suggestion\\nthat says something like 'want to sound more confident?'\\nOr something similar, and we can click see suggestion.\\nSo in this case, it highlights this sentence\\nand it's suggesting that I rewrite it\\nto sound more confident.\\n\\nAnd you may see other types of suggestions\\ndepending on what you've written.\\nNow, you can also use the slider to see the difference\\nbetween, in this case, the confident\\nand uncertain versions of the sentence.\\nIf I like the confident version more,\\nI can just click rephrase and it replaces that text.\\nOkay, so that's a look at how to have Grammarly\\nanalyze the tone of your writing,\\nand in some cases offer up suggestions for improving it.\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:5966294\",\"duration\":237,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Use the AI assistant and adjust your

that.\\nThen you can select up to three different adjectives\\nto describe your tone.\\nMaybe I like to be empathetic and confident,\\nand you can also specify your profession,\\nwhich could further help Grammarly compose your text\\nin a manner people in your industry are accustomed to.\\nWe can also just leave that blank.\\nAt the bottom here,\\nwe can specify, in this case, the type\\nof
