sometimes planning,\\nso it's very important that you understand upfront\\nwhat each of those words mean.\\nForecasting, in the context of finance,\\nmeans to estimate the future performance of your company\\nbased purely on its past performance\\nand the factual elements available to you.\\n\\nIt's very much like weather forecasting\\nwhich tells you what could possibly happen to the weather\\nbased on the analysis\\nof past and current weather conditions.\\nFor example, based on past and current performance\\nyou could estimate that your business\\nwill generate $10,000 next

When it comes to financial projections,\\nstart-ups and established businesses\\ncannot be treated the same way.\\nAs we will see at length in this course,\\na big part of preparing financial projections\\nstarts in understanding the past performance\\nof your company.\\nFor established businesses,\\nthere's plenty of past performance\\nto be analyzed and understood,\\nin order to make a robust financial projection.\\nOn the other hand, start-ups have\\nvery little history behind them,\\nso there is not much to be analyzed,\\nand if you think about financial projections\\nas part of a start-up project,\\nfor the preparation of a business plan, for example,\\nthen you have even less information,\\nas the company has not started yet.\\n\\nThat, therefore, calls for different approaches,\\nbased on the amount of information available,\\nto prepare your financial projection.\\nAs we have seen previously,\\na financial plan has an element of forecast\\nand an element of goal or aspiration.\\nSo, if you think about doing a financial plan\\nfor an established business, it is quite straightforward,\\nas you have plenty of past information\\nto use to do the forecast piece,\\nto which you will add your new goals for the year.\\n\\nFor start-ups or business plans,\\nyou won't have as much past information,\\nwhich means that the forecast element of your plan\\nwill be relatively small, or maybe even inexistent.\\nMost of your plan will, therefore,\\nbe based on the new things you will be doing,\\nor in other words, your aspirations.\\nAnother big difference between\\nestablished businesses and start-ups\\nis that established businesses will be more stable,\\nand so, most months or years will look\\nmore or less the same, in business performance terms.\\n\\nOf course, some years will be better and some more difficult\\nbut there will be a clear trajectory\\non which the business is.\\nFor start-ups, the business is just starting,\\nso every month is going to be\\npotentially very different from the previous one.\\nBusiness could double every month\\nor even multiply by a bigger factor.\\nSo, there is little hope of having\\na realistic forecast based on past performance,\\nsince there is not enough business yet\\nto have the necessary stability\\nthe forecast preparation requires.\\n\\nIn this course, we will first look at methodology\\nthat is more suitable to established businesses,\\nbecause that's how we will cover\\nmost of the techniques available\\nto prepare financial projections.\\nThen we will look at the

In this course, we will learn\\nabout two techniques to build financial projections.\\nThe Top Down Approach and the Bottom Up Approach.\\nThose are not two techniques from which you need to choose,\\nbut two different techniques that we will use and then\\ncombine in order to get an even better financial projection.\\nThe Bottom-Up Approach is a methodology that starts\\nfrom the details of the company.\\nIn a bottom-up approach, you take detailed projections\\nof individual elements of the company,\\nsuch as product performance, or customer performance,\\nor even the expected performance of actions\\nyou will be taking to change the business trajectory,\\nand you will add together those detailed projections\\nto build the big picture.\\n\\nThe great thing about bottom-up projection is that they're\\ngrounded in concrete, real elements.\\nThey are very rational and can be analyzed\\nat the end of the year to understand\\nwhat did not go as planned.\\nThe downside of bottom-up plans is that they tend\\nto project only the things that you know are happening.\\nSo for example, if you have just hired a new salesperson\\nto increase your business, and if your business\\ndoes increase, then you could conclude\\nthat the two are related, but it could very well be\\nthat the market has picked up at the same time\\nand that this is the true reason\\nfor the increase in business.\\n\\nAlso, because the bottom-up projection is very detailed,\\nyou can sometimes lose sight of the big picture,\\nand come to conclusions that are not so realistic anymore.\\nFor example, a typical unrealistic effect of bottom-up\\nprojections is that you list everything you want to do\\nin the year, and plan for the success of every action.\\nOnce you add it all up, you get an unrealistic plan\\nthat is much too ambitious.\\nThat's where top-down projections come in.\\nTop-down projections are much less detailed.\\n\\nThe starting point here is the big picture.\\nThe big picture is then projected into the future\\nbased on the overall trajectory of the business.\\nIt is not detailed at all, it is not grounded in reality,\\nbut consistent with what the big picture\\nhas been in the past years.\\nTherefore, it takes into consideration that some\\nof your actions will be successful and some others won't.\\nIt also takes into consideration all the things\\nthat are happening and that you might not even know of.\\n\\nBecause they've been part of your past performance,\\nthey're automatically picked up by this approach.\\nTaken separately, both bottom-up and top-down techniques\\nare far from being perfect, but somewhere\\nbetween the two projections lies the truth\\nof what will happen based on the elements available to you.\\nWe will therefore, start by learning how to build\\na bottom-up financial projection, then we will learn\\nhow to prepare a top-down projection,\\nand finally we will learn how to combine the two techniques\\nin order to have a final, improved financial projection.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:186183\",\"duration\":199,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Volatility and the treatment of

When preparing a financial projection you will\\nbump into two kinds of business elements.\\nThe ones that are stable and therefore easily predictable,\\nand the ones that occur less often and for which it is\\nmore difficult to note when they will happen.\\nIn other terms, those business elements can be\\ncategorized based on their level of uncertainty,\\nwhich is also called volatility.\\nAs you have probably guessed already, the more\\npredictable things are better for our financial projection,\\nbecause we know what will happen and when.\\n\\nFor example, we know you and I are going to need a salary\\nnext month, so wages in general are very predictable,\\nand as long as we know who is employed in the company,\\nwe know that we will have an expense every month for their salary\\nOn the other hand, some business\\nactivities are much less certain.\\nFor example, what is the probability of your company\\nsigning a contract that is ten times\\nthe size of your usual business?\\nProbably very low because if it weren't,\\nit would be a part of your usual business,\\nit would therefore be very risky to build your plan\\nassuming you will sign one of those contracts this year.\\n\\nBut lets say now that you did sign one last year,\\nshould you have your financial plan assume that\\nthis year as well, you will sign one of those contracts?\\nProbably not, because signing one last year is by no means\\na guarantee of you signing another one this year,\\nand building financial plans that assume that\\nvery unlikely things will happen is putting it\\nat a great risk of being unrealistic.\\nSo the way to treat those elements\\nin a financial plan, is to do it in four steps.\\n\\nThe first step is to split your past\\nP&Ls into two different P&Ls.\\nThose two P&Ls are a predictable one,\\nwhich includes everything you would label as,\\nbusiness as usual, and an unpredictable P&L,\\nwhich includes everything you would label as, exceptional.\\nThese two added together, make up your entire business.\\nThe second step is to prepare a financial projection\\nfor your predictable business.\\n\\nYou will learn more about that in the coming chapters.\\nThe third is to gather information on any known\\nunusual activity that could happen in the near future,\\nand to include it in one form or another into your plan.\\nFor example, if you know a very large contract is\\nunder negotiation, there is therefore a probability\\nthat this exceptional element will happen.\\nIt should therefore be part of your financial plan.\\n\\nWe will see in later chapters, how we do that.\\nThe fourth and last step is to put your two P&L's\\nback together, business as usual, and exceptional business.\\nThis time, however, we'll look not only at your past\\nperformance but also for the future\\nperformance you have projected.\\nBy doing that, you will be able to prepare a projection\\nthat will be realistic, in the sense that it will plan\\nonly on predictable elements, and those elements\\nthat are exceptional but you know could happen.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"1.

The first preparation we need to do,\\nas hinted in our introductory chapter,\\nis to break down our P&L into two categories\\nbased on the volatility of our business.\\nThe reason why we want to break down our past P&L\\nis that we will be using two different methodologies\\nto forecast our past P&L depending on if that element\\nis a day-to-day factor and therefore more stable\\nand predictable, or if it's an exceptional one.\\nYou might want to ask why day-to-day business is supposed\\nto be more predictable, after all, you don't always know\\nwhen the next customer is going to come in.\\n\\nIn many times, new customers look nothing like\\nthe previous ones and could have very different needs.\\nSo, how can we say that day-to-day business\\nis so stable and predictable?\\nTo answer that question, we need to step back a bit\\nfrom those thoughts on the profile\\nand needs of our customers.\\nEvery business has tens, hundreds, or thousands\\nof customers that all look different\\nand have different needs.\\nNevertheless, every day, new ones come in and buy from them.\\n\\nBehind that variety of profiles and needs,\\nthere is a commonality that we sometimes fail to detect,\\nbut even if we can't put a name on it,\\nwe can still accept the fact that there is something\\nwe are doing that has some level of resonance\\nwith the market and our customers,\\nand that keeps them coming in and wanting for more.\\nEvery day, the details will change, but overall,\\nthere will be a continuing flow of customers.\\n\\nProjecting the day-to-day business is the same\\nas being confident that different customers,\\nwith different needs, will continue to come to us\\nand buy our products, and that our day-to-day type of\\nbusiness will remain the same in the future,\\nas it was in the past.\\nI think this is a reasonable assumption to make.\\nBy the way, if our day-to-day business picks up,\\nor tanks, that just means that something in the dynamic\\nthat links us to our customers has changed,\\nand that we need to figure out how to make it work again.\\n\\nBut otherwise, if we keep on doing the same thing,\\nit is reasonable to expect to get the same financial result.\\nNow, we need to define what we call exceptional.\\nIn our case, exceptional is everything\\nthat occurs very rarely and has a significant\\nfinancial impact on your company.\\nIf, for example, it is very rare for you\\nto get an order from an international customer\\nthat the order doesn't have any impact on your company\\nmore than any other order, then it's not exceptional.\\n\\nIf, for example, you get a very big order\\nthat significantly impacts the finances of your company,\\nbut if you get big orders like that on a regular basis,\\nthen again, it's not exceptional.\\nBut if you get an order that has both rarity\\nand significance, then you can count it\\nas exceptional business.\\nIn this chapter, we will be focusing on revenue,\\nbut this definition holds true for expenditures as well.\\nIn my other course, Financial Analysis,\\nanalyzing the top line with Excel,\\nI teach a complete methodology to define\\nwhat you should call for your business specifically,\\nday-to-day or exceptional business.\\n\\nYou should check it out.\\nOnce you have done this breakdown,\\nyou should now have two views of your company's P&L.\\nThe day-to-day, stable business,\\nand the exceptional business.\\nWe will start by projecting the stable, day-to-day

this video\\nwe will be looking at your revenue performance\\nas a function of the resources you have.\\nThe logic here is that you spend\\neither money or your energy\\non creating business opportunities,\\nsome of which turn into revenue for your company.\\nTherefore, if you put more resources\\nat the service of your company\\nthrough more sales people,\\nmore marketing campaigns, ads,\\nthen the more opportunities you should see coming\\nand ultimately, the more revenue\\nyour company will be getting.\\n\\nAnother fair assumption is to think\\nthat if you don't change the resources you put\\nat the service of your company,\\nthen you should not see any change\\nin your revenue performance.\\nThe simple logic here is going to be that\\nif you have had the same resources\\nin place for an entire year\\ndoing the same thing\\nevery working day of the year,\\nfor all you know your revenue\\nshould be pretty much the same the following year\\nif you change nothing to your setup.\\nIf on the contrary things have been changing\\nduring the past year,\\nthen chances are good that next year\\nwill be somewhat different from last year.\\n\\nAs we have just identified,\\nthere is a link that exists between\\nyour resources and your revenue\\nand that link is called productivity.\\nIn simple terms,\\nyou put in dollars on resources\\nand those resources will produce\\nsome level of return.\\nThat's their productivity\\nwhich in turn will become the revenue of your company.\\nIn reality, there is another step in between\\nwhich is that your resources\\nwill generate opportunities\\nand that a portion of that will turn into a revenue\\nbut we will assume for now that you win on average\\nalways that same amount of opportunities\\nas a proportion of all the opportunities you see coming.\\n\\nEach of your resources has a certain level of productivity.\\nFor example, a sales rep would produce\\na certain level of business every year for your company.\\nIt probably took her or him\\na few months to get to know your company,\\nmaybe the industry,\\nhis portfolio of customers\\nand which customers to go after.\\nThen it probably took that sales rep\\nsome more time to start building relationships\\nwith his or her prospects\\nand to open new accounts.\\n\\nTherefore, it would take some time\\nbetween the hiring of the sales rep\\nand the time at which he or she\\nreached full productivity.\\nFor a revenue projection,\\nthat also means that it is not enough\\nto list all the resources available\\nto generate new revenue\\nbut also to see if that resource\\nhas reached full productivity or not\\nthen based on that information,\\nyou can define what the productivity\\nof each resource will be in the coming year.\\n\\nLet's take a concrete example.\\nImagine that your company\\nsells all kinds of pens to distributors.\\nRegular pens, sturdy pens, ultra-thin pens and so on.\\nTo do so, you have two sales reps\\nand three marketing programs.\\nLet's imagine now that one of your sales reps\\nhas been around for years\\nand that you hired the second one\\nat the beginning of last year.\\nLet's also assume that you just started\\nhaving marketing activities\\nand that you launched all of them\\nin July of last year.\\n\\nHere are some of the things we can assume\\nbased on that information.\\nThe sales rep that has been around for a long time\\nhas reached his peak productivity\\nand whatever he generated last year,\\nexcluding exceptional elements,\\nshould be the same in the coming year.\\nThe new sales rep was hired\\nat the beginning of last year\\nand has had to learn\\neverything about the company,\\nindustry, portfolio and so on\\nand might have reached his peak productivity\\nby the end of the year,\\nbut overall, his productivity for last year\\nis a mix of low productivity months\\nand high productivity ones.\\n\\nHe will therefore generate more revenue next year.\\nHow much more?\\nIf he reached his peak productivity\\nin November, for example,\\nhe or she could be doing that level of business\\nevery month for the following year.\\nIt would also be good to benchmark him or her\\nto the other sales rep\\nto make sure that resulting productivity makes sense.\\nIf their peak productivity has not been reached,\\nthen next year she'll still have a few months\\nof ramping productivity\\nin a majority of peak productivity ones.\\n\\nAs for the marketing programs,\\nsince those started in July,\\nyou get only half of the full year benefit.\\nA quick way to account for it\\nwill be to assume that if you have them\\nthis year from January\\nyou should have twice the benefit you got last year.\\nAs for marketing programs,\\nsince those started

margin projection is actually much simpler than revenue projection.\\nAs a reminder, gross margin is what is left over from your revenue once\\nyou have paid all the costs that relate to the production of your goods.\\nThis allows you to find how profitable each individual sale is.\\nIn this chapter, we will mostly use gross margin in its percentage form\\nin order to prepare the projection.\\nGross margin percentage is simply the result of\\ndividing gross margin by revenue for a given period of time.\\n\\nGross margin is really influenced by four things.\\nThe price you set your products or\\nservices at, the cost of producing your products or rendering your service,\\nthe discounts you give to your customers which results in a lower selling price and\\ntherefore less margin, and the mix of products you sell, since you'll be\\nmaking more margin in years during which you sold more high margin products.\\nThe first three points relate to the margin you will be generating on each of\\nyour products.\\n\\nSo if we go back to the pen production business example, based on the cost of\\nproducing an ultra thin pen and on the final price at which you will sell it,\\nincluding a discount, you will be generating a certain level of margin.\\nIf we look at it on your overall performance for the previous year,\\nor if you already defined at what margin you want to sell it this year,\\nyou have the gross margin percentage for your ultra thin pen available to you.\\nWhat is left for you to know is if you intend on giving more or\\nless of a discount in the coming year, and if you expect to sell more or\\nfewer ultra thin pens as a proportion of your overall sales.\\n\\nWe will review both of these notions in this chapter.\\nBecause we'll be talking specifically about gross margin projections in\\nthis chapter, if at any point you feel like you want more information on\\ngross margin in general, you can learn more about it in the course\\nFinancial Literacy: Reading Financial Reports in the Lynda.com Training Library.\\nAlso we're assuming you already have your current gross margin figures available.\\nIf not you will

top-down approach is tackling the same problem but\\nfrom a completely different angle.\\nIt is a much simpler and less detailed.\\nIn the previous chapter,\\nwe went through a lot of detail down to individual transactions with\\nthe objective of including anything we know is happening in the company.\\nWith the second approach,\\nit is more like an astronaut's view of the piano, focusing only on the big picture.\\nAnd as I explain at the beginning of the course,\\nthe second approach is not one you can use on its own.\\n\\nAs it's a way to high level.\\nIt is helpful though as an extra point of view the two will combine with our\\nbottom-up approach.\\nSo again, why is there any added value in looking at the P&L\\nfrom a very high level standpoint?\\nSimply because when working in a decent way,\\nwe focus solely on the things we believe will happen.\\nFor example, we include only the exceptional elements that we know will be\\nhappening and expenditures that make sense with regards to the plan we have laid out.\\n\\nThere is one thing we never count in the bottom-up approach though and\\nthat is the surprises that always come.\\nThose large contracts that happen but do not make sense to plan for.\\nThose big expenditures that we thought we did everything to prevent but\\nstill happened.\\nThere is an element of uncertainty every year that we rationally never plan for.\\nBut it still happens.\\nThe top-down approach is great for that, because it builds a plan that assumes that\\nwhatever trajectory you're on, it will remain the same.\\n\\nThe other reason that bottom-up plans are not perfect and require some\\ncombination with top-down plans is the fact that bottom-up plans are filled with\\nactions that will solve all the problems of the past with the underlying\\nassumption that every action you're planning to take will be successful.\\nWe would love that to be true.\\nBut it is unlikely to happen.\\nIt is safe to bet that some action will be extremely successful and\\nothers somewhat less.\\nThe top-down approach is here to correct that.\\n\\nNow, what exactly do we mean by top-down approach?\\nWell, in fact, we're talking about more than one methodology.\\nThis approach is to run at least two very high-level projection methodologies and\\nto average out the results.\\nFor example, here we will be learning about\\nthe revenue trajectory methodology and the exit methodology.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:186206\",\"duration\":242,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"The

In this first methodology we will be projecting\\nrevenue based on the month over month\\nor quarter over quarter trajectory\\nthe company is currently on.\\nThis methodology is actually the combination\\nof two subprocesses.\\nThe first one is that a company is subject\\nto seasonality within the year.\\nIt can be that the seasonality is dictated by its customers\\nwho buy more before Christmas and result\\nin an increase in revenue in November and December.\\n\\nBy its suppliers, if for example the goods come from\\na distant country and shipments arrive only every\\nfew months in such case the sales and revenue performance\\nwould be somewhat linked to those arrivals of inventory.\\nBy its internal processes such as, for example,\\nquarterly sales targets which result in sales reps\\nputting an extra effort at the end of each quarter\\nto meet or beat their target and therefore results\\nin an increase in revenue every three months.\\n\\nThe second one is that wherever you are in your current\\nperformance is a good indication of where you are going.\\nFor example, if you are over performing this month\\ncompared to your past performance\\nthen you are in a positive trend\\nwhich should be reflected in any following month.\\nThe methodology is then to use those two elements\\nand to use them to project the revenue of the company.\\nLet me give you a concrete example.\\n\\nLet's say that we have identified a pattern\\nthat is happening every year.\\nIn particular that the performance of the beginning of the year\\nis more or less always lower in the first quarter of the year\\nby 20% compared to the last quarter of the previous year.\\nWe could imagine for example that because of Christmas\\nthe performance at the end of the year is very high\\nfor example of $500,000 and that once we are past that time\\nbusiness gets back to its normal level\\nand it's just 20% lower or in other words at $400,000.\\n\\nIn this case the methodology here would be to take\\nfor example the revenue achieved at the end of the\\nlast quarter of the year preceding the year we are trying to\\nforecast and apply to it the evolution in revenue\\nthat we have seen happening in the past\\nbetween the last quarter of the past year\\nand the first quarter of the following year.\\nFor example, if the last quarter of the preceding year\\nwas $100,000 then we would calculate that the\\nfollowing quarter would be 20% smaller\\nand we calculate that we should be expecting $80,000\\nwhich is 80% times $100,000.\\n\\nThen we would carry on with that methodology\\napplying the same evolution seen in the past between\\nQ1s and Q2s, Q2s and Q3s and Q3s and Q4s.\\nIf for example the Q1 to Q2 evolution is usually equal\\nto zero which means that Q2 is usually look like Q1s\\nthen we would forecast Q2 at $80,000 as well.\\nIf we knew that Q2 to Q3 evolution is usually an\\nincrease of 10%, we would forecast Q3 at $88,000\\nwhich is equal to $80,000 times 110%\\nand if we knew that Q4 on average was bigger\\nthan Q3 by 30%, we would be forecasting Q4 of this\\nnew year at $114,400.\\n\\nThis is how the revenue trajectory methodology works.\\nLet's now look into the exit methodology.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:186207\",\"duration\":135,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"The

The second methodology\\nis even simpler to calculate.\\nIt is based on the performance you've been having\\nsince the beginning of the year,\\nand compares it to your performance the previous year.\\nIf, for example, you're at the beginning of May\\nand have generated $400,000 worth of revenue,\\nwith this methodology you will want to compare it\\nto how we performed last year at the same time\\nand compare it to where we actually finished\\nthe same year.\\nSo, if for example,\\nlast year we generated $300,000 of revenue\\nby that time of the year,\\nand the year finished at 1.2 million dollars\\nof revenue for the full year,\\nthen we would simply calculate\\nthat we have generated 25 percent of our revenue\\nby the end of April\\nby dividing 300,000 by 1.2 million dollars.\\n\\nThen, we would simply assume\\nthat whatever we generated this year by the end of April,\\nwould be equal to 25 percent of the full year.\\nSo in this case,\\nsince we have generated $400,000 by the end of April,\\nand this is supposed to represent 25 percent\\nof the expected full-year revenue,\\nthen our projection for the year\\nwould be equal to $400,000 divided by 25 percent,\\nand therefore, equal to 1.6 million dollars.\\n\\nYou could also calculate it\\nby taking this year's year-to-date revenue $400,000\\nmultiplying it by last years total revenue,\\n1.2 million dollars,\\nand dividing it by last years revenue at the same time,\\nend of April in our case,\\nfor $300,000.\\nThat will give you the same result\\nof 1.6 million dollars.\\nTo finalize our revenue projection,\\nwe will just then average out\\nthose results of both methodologies.\\n\\nSo in other words,\\nsum the two revenue projections,\\nand divide them by two.\\nSo in other

sufficient,\\nbut of course, some companies\\nrequire more or less time to achieve profitability.\\nIf we take the example of a two-year time frame,\\nthat means that your PNL 24 months down the

We like to plan.\\nWe have strategic plans, 10-year plans, 5-year plans,\\nquarterly plans, and many, many more types of plans.\\n\\nBut we need to think differently about planning\\nbecause what we plan for is often not what happens.\\nThe second of these functions is command.\\nWe like to feel in command,\\nand the simplicity of this idea comforts us.\\nWe also like to believe that command\\nis a simple and clean thing,\\nlike an organizational chart trickling down\\nand executed optimally.\\nThe truth is, your organization may have\\na structured organization chart somewhere on your website,\\nbut your organization is built on a network\\nof formal and informal relationships\\nthat don't adhere to a hierarchical tree.\\n\\nSo to affect change in your organization,\\nlook at the most interconnected\\nand influential parts of your network as a leverage point,\\nand you'll get further if you know this\\nand act on this reality.\\nInterestingly, we so love hierarchical mental models\\nthat we also use them to manage organizational processes.\\nWe simply turn our org chart on its side\\nand voila, it's a flow chart.\\nThis all means that you need\\nto think differently about processes and controls\\nand move towards effective, reality-based processes.\\n\\nThis requires three things,\\nbrutal honesty about your starting point,\\nbeing data-driven about where you really are,\\nclarity of your ending point, your vision or your goals.\\nRemember that leaders stand in the future\\nand describe what they see.\\nAnd third, flexibility and adaptivity in how you get there,\\nwhich will require knowing\\nthe simple rules underlying your work.\\nFinally, the traditional mental model\\nof organizations views humans as resources to be utilized,\\nsqueezing for all their value to serve the organization,\\nbut now organizations are moving away\\nfrom this traditional human resources model\\ntoward a mental model of talent management.\\n\\nThis is less of a utilization paradigm\\nand more of a developmental, incentives-based,\\nmotivational approach to managing people.\\nEither way, the goal for managing humans is\\nto leverage the relationships among them\\nto create an agile super organism that can adapt\\nto external forces when it's necessary.\\nVision, mission, capacity, and learning,\\nare natural functions of organizations,\\nwhether or not it is purposefully designed or articulated.\\n\\nVMCL replaces this clockwork approach to organizations\\nwith a more systemic approach based\\non what we complex adaptive systems or CAS.\\nThe insights we'll offer you about VMCL will help you move\\ntoward a more reality-based natural view\\nof your organization away from the clock-like\\nor mechanistic metaphor to a flock-like\\nor biological metaphor of your organization,\\nand then you can have a greater effect\\non the outcomes you seek.\\n\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Introduction\",\"size\":20413787,\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentChapter:3861035\"},{\"duration\":1365,\"entries\":[{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3870019\",\"duration\":201,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Reimagining the organization\",\"fileName\":\"3806196_en_US_01_01_MM30\",\"demo\":true,\"videoCreationMetadata\":{\"hasSlides\":false,\"assignedBy\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"assignedTo\":\"urn:li:member:-1\",\"editingNotes\":\"TAKE 1: AFter a full read, did an in-take pickup midway through.

That's the vision.\\nBut the mission is to go out and convert the unconverted.\\nNow, what are you going to need to act, to do the mission?\\nYou're going to need capacity.\\nCapacity is the ability to take action.\\nSo mission is the action that you do repeatedly,\\nand that's a function of an organization.\\nAnd capacity is the potential for action.\\nIt's like having the necessary energy to act.\\nNow, you don't just want the potential for any action.\\n\\nYou want the potential for the action\\nthat is critical to this organism.\\nSo you can want the capacity to do the few things\\nyou need to do over and over again to reach your vision.\\nYou can think of capacity as a system of your systems\\nthat act as batteries to fuel your actions.\\nSo each of these batteries\\nis a system in your organization,\\nand there could be different size batteries\\ndepending on the size of your capacital systems.\\n\\nMost importantly, the energy of those batteries\\ncan be converted into action,\\nand that energy must be directed to your mission.\\nYour capacity systems must be mission-centric.\\nIn other words, all of your organization's energy\\nmust be directed towards the execution\\nof a mission to help you reach your vision.\\nCapacity exists in the systems\\nand subsystems that are in the organism or the organization.\\n\\nAnd all subsystems need to make up\\nan integrated system of systems that allow this organism,\\nyour organization,\\nto have capacity to do the actions it needs to do\\nto reach the goal that it needs to reach.\\nAnd here's why understanding these four VMCL functions\\nis so important.\\nI guarantee you\\nthat in real life things will get infinitely complex,\\nand when things get infinitely complex,\\nyou will get divorced from reality\\nand may have a hard time handling it.\\n\\nSo as an adaptive leader, you can be one of the few people\\nwho can stand back and say, \\\"Yes, this is very complex\\\"\\nbecause all organizations are very complex.\\nBut underneath, there is a simple set of functions\\nthat have to be in place for this thing to be effective.\\nAnd if you focus on those functions and help your people\\nand teams to focus on those four functions,\\nyou will be able to navigate the complexity better.\\n\\nThe final thing,\\nwhich we haven't talked about yet, is learning.\\nIn our little organism,\\nlearning is another set of appendages.\\nWe will use these little rubber bands\\nthat go out in the world and collect information.\\nLet's say that there's some toxin over here\\nand we can use this hand sanitizer,\\nand these learning appendages sense the danger.\\n\\\"Oh no, it's dangerous!\\\"\\nSo they move right to avoid\\nand move itself out of the harm's way.\\n\\nSo this whole organism might move to the right\\nbased on that sensory apparatus.\\nThat's learning.\\nFor your organization, these signals\\ncan be market forces or competition.\\nThis could be poor customer feedback about a new product.\\nIt could be any kind of feedback from the environment\\nthat's coming into the system.\\nAnd that feedback, if listened to,\\ncould change the capacity that you need.\\nIt could change the actions that you do, your mission.\\nNo matter what kind of organization,\\nno matter what level of scale,\\nyour organization has these functions,\\nit has a purpose, a vision.\\n\\nIt repeatedly does stuff every day, a mission.\\nIt has or doesn't have the capacity to do its daily work,\\nand to survive, it must respond to\\nand learn from feedback.\\nSo these functions are what we're trying\\nto design more capability in your organizations.\\nAnd as an adaptive leader, you can do that purposefully\\nby building clear, concise,\\nand transparent vision, mission, capacity, and learning\\ninto the culture of your organization.\\n\\nJust like this organism.\\nIf you just sit back and do nothing,\\nyour organization will have VMCL functions.\\nWhat we're trying to do is design our organization\\nmore purposefully,\\nso that we can get better at picking\\nwhere this thing ends up, and how fast it ends up there.\\nNo matter what, there's going to be VMCL functions\\nin your organization.\\nYou just have to figure out what they are\\nand what you want them to be,\\nand constantly nudge your culture\\nto see the difference\\nand bring about your vision.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3861032\",\"duration\":292,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Simple rules for adaptive

Without a vision, our actions lack meaning\\nand look more like aimless wanderings\\nthan purposeful strides.\\nIt is the vision that answers the question\\nof why we do what we do,\\nproviding the inspiration that fuels our daily pursuits.\\nHowever, a vision alone is not sufficient.\\nIt needs a companion in the form of a well-defined mission.\\nIf the vision is the destination,\\nthe mission is the map:\\nthe series of steps and actions that,\\nwhen repeated consistently, pave the way\\nto the future envisioned state.\\n\\nThe mission is the tactical guide\\nthat transforms aspirations into practical daily tasks.\\nIt encapsulates the what and how of the journey,\\nbreaking the vision into manageable, actionable components.\\nMission tells you what to focus on doing.\\nIt is simply the steps you repeatedly do\\nto achieve the vision.\\nSo the relationship between vision and mission is crucial,\\neach serving distinct, yet interdependent, roles.\\n\\nBecause of this, vision and mission must align.\\nMisalignment can lead to confusion\\nand inefficiency and the risk of straying off course.\\nLike a well-choreographed dance,\\nvision and mission must move in harmony,\\nwith each step supporting and reinforcing the other.\\nLike visions, missions should be clear,\\nconcise, and easily understood.\\nThey are, after all, instructions\\nfor how everyone in the organization focuses their efforts.\\n\\nAnd it's a succinct encapsulation of purpose,\\nclarifying the roles and responsibilities\\nof each member of the organization in the quest\\nto fulfill the overarching vision.\\nA good mission statement\\nexplains who does what for whom,\\nand when done repeatedly, leads to your vision.\\nHere's an example.\\nSeveral years ago, the CEO of H+ Sport,\\na company based on a fitness app, came to us\\nto simplify what needed to be done\\nduring an unexpected period of massive growth in their app.\\n\\nIn a very short time,\\nthe app became wildly successful\\nand had over 80 million users when he came to us.\\nThe challenge was to streamline operations,\\nensuring that the expanding workforce was aligned\\nwith the overarching vision.\\nThe vision was clear:\\nto create a world where healthy living is the new norm,\\nproviding a compelling and motivating direction\\nfor its employees.\\nHowever, the mission,\\nthe daily roadmap for employees, required some refinement.\\n\\nThe mission was where the company was struggling,\\nas it's the mission that sets forth the simple rules\\nof the daily work that must be done to reach a vision.\\nIn other words, the rapid growth of customers led\\nto a corollary massive growth in the number of employees,\\nand he needed to know how to direct their daily work\\nin a simple way that would lead to the accomplishment\\nof their vision.\\nHe brought his 12 top executives to an offsite with us\\nto focus on the problem.\\n\\nHe was determined to leave with a solution.\\nSo we spent two days understanding the workflows\\nof each division of the company\\nand ultimately articulated that the mission\\nacross the organization was to facilitate\\nand motivate healthy choices\\nfor the 80 million users of the app.\\nIn other words, their new mission\\ncut through the chaos of their startup\\nto identify two things that needed to be done repeatedly\\nto bring about their vision.\\n\\nIn these types of scenarios,\\na well-defined mission serves as a practical guide\\nfor employees, offering clarity amid the chaos of growth\\nand other types of organizational change.\\nBy articulating who does what for whom,\\nthe mission transformed the abstract,\\nbut motivating, vision into tangible, achievable objectives.\\nThis prevented organizational disarray\\nand ensured that every employee's daily efforts\\ncontributed cohesively to the broader vision.\\n\\nAs an adaptive leader,\\nyou must help all the members of your organization identify\\nthe simple rules of the mission\\nthat collectively lead to the vision that you're seeking.\\nA mission must also be measurable.\\nThis is essential so that leadership can continuously assess\\nto what degree the work efforts of your mission\\nare contributing to achieving your vision.\\nAlso, good missions don't live in frames and websites.\\n\\nThey live in the hearts and minds\\nof everyone in your organization.\\nAsk yourself: If you walked around your building\\nand randomly asked 10 employees\\nin different levels of your organization\\nhow likely is it that they could recite and explain\\nyour mission without looking it up?\\nJust like vision,\\nif they can't articulate your mission verbatim,\\nyou don't have one.\\nThe crucial and interdependent relationship\\nbetween vision and mission is your best navigation system\\nfor individuals inside your organization.\\n\\nVision and mission provides direction\\nbut also inspires daily actions with purpose.\\nIn a world of constant change and growth,\\nknowing what must be done and why it matters\\nkeeps us grounded.\\nThis ensures that our collective efforts propel us\\ntowards a shared and meaningful

Almost all the leaders I coach\\nwant to increase production, performance and resources,\\nand what this usually means\\nis they need to address capacity.\\nCapacity is the ability to produce, perform,\\nor deploy resources towards a defined goal.\\nWhile capacity is not as inspirational as vision,\\nit is an indispensable part\\nof translating intentions into actions.\\nIntentions without the ability to take action are just that,\\nthey're intentions.\\n\\nCapacity is the state of readiness\\nthat enables the execution of a mission,\\nand is itself made up of a complex interplay of systems\\nthat must be directed toward the mission\\nthat aligns with and contributes to the overarching vision.\\nVision is what you see,\\nmission is what you do,\\nand capacity is the systemic readiness\\nenabling you to do the mission.\\nIt's crucial to recognize that vision sets the direction,\\nmission charts the course,\\nand capacity provides the means\\nto navigate that course effectively.\\n\\nYou must acknowledge the interconnectedness\\nof these elements\\nand the fact that they need to work in concert\\nto achieve a common mission.\\nIn short, capacity must align with the mission.\\nCapacity for an organization can include\\ninnumerable systems, processes, and roles.\\nIt's so complex that capacity is often seen\\nas a bunch of systems,\\nor what we call a BoS, a bunch of systems.\\nBut it should be seen as a system of systems,\\nor what we call an SoS,\\nthat helps us to achieve the mission.\\n\\nAs an adaptive leader,\\nit's vital that you ensure\\nthat every single member of your organization\\nunderstands, first,\\nthe purpose of capacity is to fulfill the daily mission\\nto eventually achieve the vision.\\nNote that systems that are not serving your mission\\nshould be questioned and likely removed.\\nSecond, these systems should not exist in isolation.\\nThey should fit together or align\\nto form a cohesive system of systems.\\n\\nThird, each person within the organization\\nshould know their role\\nin increasing organizational capacity.\\nAnd finally, organizational learning\\nfacilitated through feedback mechanisms\\nis the catalyst for expanding capacity.\\nImportantly, learning from experiences\\nand insights gained in the execution of the mission\\nfeeds back into refining and augmenting\\nthe organizational capacity.\\nBeyond that, capacity must be measurable.\\n\\nEstablishing metrics is essential\\nto assess the effectiveness of capacity\\nin executing the mission.\\nThis helps you direct organizational resources\\nand efforts towards optimizing capacity\\nfor mission accomplishment.\\nSo, your goal is to direct capacity towards mission,\\nwhich, in turn, achieves vision.\\nHere's an example.\\nJeff Bezos is known for his belief\\nthat meetings structured around PowerPoints\\ndid not yield increased capacity to execute the mission.\\n\\nSo, he developed what is known\\nas the narrative meeting process.\\nHe restructured meetings\\nto focus on four-to-six-page evidence-based narratives\\nin a memo form prepared prior to each meeting.\\nHe then allocated the first 20 minutes of the meeting\\nfor reading the document,\\nfollowed by a substantive discussion and debate\\nby diligently questioning the presenting team.\\nWhile this shift may seem logistical or even superficial,\\nit wasn't.\\n\\nIt led to an immediate sharing\\nof the same mental model of the issue at hand\\nand led to better-informed decisions\\nand effectiveness in the organization.\\nSo, when thinking about capacity, do four things.\\nFirst, ask yourself,\\nwhat capacity systems are necessary\\nto ensure success of your mission moments?\\nThen, think about a team, process,\\nor system in your organization,\\nand ask yourself,\\nhow is each of them providing capacity for the mission?\\nThird, decide how you'll get unvarnished feedback.\\n\\nYou can use that feedback to expand your capacity.\\nThis is done by connecting\\nthe organization's capacital systems\\nto its learning systems.\\nAnd finally, check one more time and ask,\\nhow certain are you that all of your organization's systems\\nare building capacity to do your mission?\\nYou, as an adaptive leader,\\nmust ensure that every component\\nof your organizational capacity is aligned to the mission,\\nenabling you to reach your envisioned future.\\n\\n\"},{\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentVideo:3862044\",\"duration\":357,\"visible\":true,\"requiredForCertificateOfCompletion\":true,\"name\":\"Embrace learning as a cultural

our preconceived notions\\nand biases that plague our initial frame of the problem.\\nIt encourages us to think more about the framing\\nbefore we start solving.\\nAs we know the root\\nof many tough problems lies in our initial\\nframing in the first place.\\nSecond, build a mental model.\\nArticulate your thoughts about the situation at hand.\\nThird, test your mental model against the real world.\\n\\nSee how your solutions or innovations are working.\\nCollect data and observe.\\nFourth, get feedback in the form of information.\\nTalk to your employees, your clients, anyone\\nwho will share their thoughts.\\nCapture them and use them as data\\nto feedback into a revised mental model of the situation.\\nAnd finally, start the loop again.\\nInterrogate and evolve your mental

that while employees, customers, partners\\ncome and go at various times,\\nthe culture of an organization persists.\\nThe question is, is culture something\\nyou can purposefully build?\\nThe answer is yes.\\nWe can purposefully build culture and change it.\\n\\nWhere culture is concerned,\\nsuccess is always due to the sharing of mental models,\\nespecially the most important mental models\\nin your organization:\\nthe vision, the mission, the capacity, and learning,\\nas well as other mental models in your organization.\\nAnd if you don't share these mental models,\\nthen you have a few well-written statements\\nand a couple of maps.\\nCulture is what happens when people possess\\nthe same mental models.\\nThis is in contrast to the norm of sharing information.\\n\\nWe all can share a PDF or a memo,\\nbut we can't easily share our understanding of things.\\nIn other words, you can explain things to people,\\nbut you can't understand things to people.\\nGiven how inherently difficult it is\\nto change the hearts and minds of people,\\nsuccessful leaders incrementally build support\\nfor the culture change they seek.\\nRather than attempting an organization-wide change\\nat the start, adaptive leaders start by identifying\\nwhere the work needs to be done\\nand how to adequately teach, motivate,\\nand incentivize each individual\\nto make a culture shift they desire.\\n\\nTo illustrate this,\\nsee the culture-building graph or what we call the CBG.\\nThe CBG helps leaders identify people\\nwithin their organization that are already on board\\nwith the desired change, let's say the vision.\\nThese people are referred to as thought leaders.\\nThose who generally support the effort\\nare called supporters,\\nand those who are on the fence are fence-sitters.\\nAnd then there's those who are against it;\\nwe call them naysayers.\\n\\nMuch like a legislative staffer might count the votes\\nof congressmen prior to a big vote,\\nCBG tells us to incentivize the supporters\\nas a means to influence the fence-sitters to move forward\\nwith the desired change.\\nNote, importantly, that leaders also try\\nto incentivize the detractors,\\nwhich only reinforces their behaviors.\\nWhat we suggest is using the success\\nand rewards given to the supporters as motivation\\nfor movement in the right direction.\\n\\nIncentives include rewards, bonuses,\\nand inclusion in events.\\nWe then use party photos to show detractors\\nall they're missing as a way to encourage movement.\\nBeyond creating a culture campaign,\\nthere's a simple yet profound way\\nthat leaders can promote their company's culture.\\nThe key to transforming an organization's culture\\nstarts with the executives\\ndefining and developing their own behaviors\\nto be in alignment with the central tenets\\nof the desired culture.\\n\\nThe key to a super organization\\nis to embed the vision and mission\\ninto the adaptive culture.\\nAs a leader, you need to build a culture of systems thinkers\\nwho drive organizational learning\\nto improve organizational capacity\\nto do your mission repeatedly to bring about the vision.\\nThis is how you'll bring about the changes you seek.\\nVMCL is a powerful model,\\nbut the one thing I haven't told you about VMCL\\nis that it won't implement itself.\\n\\nThat's your job.\\nAt the organizational level,\\nimplementing VMCL means that you must ensure\\nthat every employee, team leader, partner,\\nand even customer has a shared definition, meaning,\\nand passion for the mental models\\nthat drive your organization,\\nin particular, your vision and mission,\\nsystems capacity and learning functions.\\nRemember that no matter what,\\neven if you just sit back and relax,\\nyour organization has a

builder\\nwho is inside the organization\\nor external to it, consulting.\\nEither way, you're designing an organization.\\nIf you're working in an existing organization,\\nthen consider yourself a renovator,\\nwhether you're internal or external to the organization.\\n\\nDecide where you land on the 2x2 table.\\nOnce you've determined\\nthe type of organization you're dealing with\\nand your role in the organizational change,\\nyou need to get a sense of where to start.\\nStep two, what we call WMYM.\\nSo step two is what I call the What Makes You Mad step,\\nor WMYM, analysis.\\nAsk yourself and your team:\\nWhat is the current state that upsets you today\\nthat you hope to change?\\nThen, describe the things in detail that you hope to change.\\n\\nOnce you have a sense\\nof the state of affairs that you are hoping to change,\\nyou need to then shift\\nto the future state you hope to create.\\nThis is step three, future state.\\nWork with your team to articulate the details\\nof the future state you envision.\\nIn other words,\\nthe state of affairs that will exist and make you happy.\\nInside of this step, you'll also need to identify\\nhow your organization and its efforts\\nare the catalyst for the change\\nfrom the current undesirable state\\nto the future desired state.\\n\\nStep four is vision.\\nThis is where you, as a leader,\\nstand in the future and describe what you see.\\nThis future is your vision.\\nOnce you've stated your vision,\\nuse the vision litmus checks\\nto ensure that it is intrinsically motivating,\\ndepicting a desired future state,\\nshort and simple, measurable,\\nand that it exists in the hearts and minds of your people.\\nOnce you have a vision,\\nstep five tells us to focus on mission.\\n\\nAsk yourself:\\nWhat are the things you do every day\\nto bring about the vision?\\nOnce you've listed them,\\nuse the mission litmus tests\\nto make sure your mission is actions done repeatedly;\\nexplains who does what for whom;\\nis simple, and clear, and easily understood;\\nis concise, meaning it's just a few words;\\nand measurable;\\nand exists, again,\\nin the hearts and minds of your employees.\\n\\nStep six of our checklist\\nfocuses on the critical relationship\\nbetween your vision and your mission.\\nWe like to make sure that they're coupled.\\nAsk yourself and your team:\\nIf you do your mission repeatedly,\\nwill you bring about the vision?\\nIf yes, move to the next step.\\nIf no, revisit both the vision and the mission\\nand rework them until they're coupled.\\nThe next step, step seven,\\nshifts our attention to the important relationship\\nbetween organizational capacity and mission.\\n\\nJust like vision and mission need to be aligned or coupled,\\nso, too, must our capacital systems and our mission.\\nAsk yourself and your team:\\nWhat systems must be in place for mission to occur daily?\\nAnd what subsystems must be in place\\nfor those systems to be in place?\\nSeek also to identify any systems in your organization\\nthat are not directly related to your mission\\nand question their necessity.\\nThey could be organizational bloat.\\n\\nStep eight of our Checklist for Adaptive Leaders\\ndirects your attention to learning.\\nAt this stage, it's helpful to review the learning formulas.\\nRemember that mental models are built.\\nWe all build them,\\nand we often struggle with communication\\nbecause we aren't seeing the differences\\nin one another's mental models of something.\\nNote also that individual learning happens\\nwhen one person changes their mental model of something,\\nwhereas organizational learning\\nhappens when a group of people make the same change\\nin a mental model.\\n\\nAnd culture is the sharing\\nof the same critical mental models across individuals,\\nthe most important of which\\nare your vision and your mission.\\nThe last part of this step\\nis to spend some time with your team,\\nlooking at the learning systems,\\nincluding informal and formal learning systems,\\nand make sure you have a robust set of metrics\\nto continuously assess individual\\nand organizational learning.\\nStep nine is to run a culture building campaign\\nto get everyone on board with your vision and your mission.\\n\\nThis involves figuring out who has\\nand has not adopted your vision and mission.\\nCategorize them into naysayers, fence-sitters,\\nadopters, and leaders.\\nApproach each group with a specific strategy,\\nsuch as deflection, party photos,\\nincentives, and support and love.\\nRemember, too, that any change effort,\\nwhether it's about big things like vision or mission,\\nthings like meeting formats,\\nyou can and should run them\\nlike an internal marketing campaign\\nto coordinate your

What distinguishes and differentiates adaptive leadership\\nfrom a more traditional idea of leadership?\\nIn our traditional idea of leadership,\\nwe imagine leaders positioned as a senior authority\\nand agent to get work done.\\nThe traditional idea of a leader oversees direct reports,\\nand the active leadership directs daily actions.\\nWhen situations arrive escalating attention,\\nthe traditional idea of leadership is concerned\\nwith responding to and working the issue or crisis,\\nwhereas the adaptive leader sets conditions\\nfor employee action that is in harmony\\nwith the vision and mission of the organization.\\n\\nThe adaptive leader does this on the front end\\nlong before the crisis or need for adaptation occurs\\nby being clear, concise, transparent, and empowering.\\nAdaptive leadership then is less about what you do\\nand more about the conditions that you set\\nand what you teach others to do within them.\\nLet's look at an example situation.\\nImagine a situation\\nwhere a customer service representative is talking\\nto a customer who has a particular problem\\nthat lies outside the norm,\\nin other words, a problem that requires the organization\\nand the customer service representative to adapt.\\n\\nIn our traditional idea of leadership,\\nwe imagine the leader somewhere close by\\nin both time and space.\\nThey share the same office area\\nand are working on the same day.\\nThe leader will perhaps help the representative\\nto solve the problem,\\nor the representative may escalate the problem\\nthrough multiple layers of leadership\\nuntil the problem can be solved.\\nAlternatively, the leader noticing\\nthat a number of such problems seem to occur\\nwould schedule meetings with other leaders\\nto review the types of problems,\\ncatalog them, categorize them,\\nand push them down,\\nmicromanage solutions to the group of representatives.\\n\\nAside from the obvious lack of empowerment\\nand subsequent disengagement associated\\nwith such a solution,\\nwe can also see\\nthat this organizational structure cannot account\\nfor all the sundry unique situations\\nand customer complexities that may occur on a daily basis.\\nTherefore, even with the best intentions,\\nthere is very little about this traditional scenario\\nthat is adaptive.\\nIt is also quite costly to push solutions upward,\\nleading to customer frustration and delay,\\nand resulting in\\nwhat can only be called a lose-lose situation,\\nwhere a costly solution\\nto the organization is also displeasing to the customer.\\n\\nAlternatively, adaptive leadership\\ntakes a very different view and approach.\\nFirst and foremost, it is not assumed that the situation\\nand the leadership of the situation\\nshares the same time and space.\\nIn other words, there may not be a physical leader nearby\\nsharing the same office or working on the same day.\\nSo where is the leadership?\\nThe leadership may have occurred weeks, months,\\nor years before in establishing a clear vision, mission,\\ncapacital systems, learning protocols, and deep culture\\nthat sets the stage for the customer service representative\\nto act upon this clarity\\nin what we would call a Distal CEO.\\n\\nIn other words, we can imagine\\nwhat the CEO of the company would do in that moment\\nas a line level customer service representative.\\nKnowing the clear vision and mission\\nand understanding the systems,\\nthe customer service representative is empowered to adapt to\\nand solve the situation,\\nand then to share their learning into the organization.\\nAs Mike Curtis,\\nAirbnb Vice President of Engineering, explained,\\n\\\"We believe in shaping good judgment in individuals\\ninstead of imposing rules across the team.\\\"\\nThe goal of any CEO should be to create Distal CEOs,\\npeople at the end of the tentacle arms\\nof the organization dealing with customers, suppliers,\\nand partners who have shared mental models\\nthat guide them through the all-important mission moments,\\npeople whose thoughts and actions indicate ownership\\nin the organization.\\n\\nLeaders need to create individuals\\nwho are constantly learning\\nand adapting based on information on the ground.\\nAnd so we've come to the end.\\nThank you for taking the time.\\nIf you'd like to dive deeper, check out our book,\\n\\\"Flock Not Clock,\\\"\\nand all the resources at our Cabrera Research Lab website,\\nand also, drop me a note on LinkedIn anytime.\\nI'd love to hear how it's going.\\nRemember, the point of this process\\nis to bring your vision into reality.\\n\\nEven when things get complex,\\nremember the simple things we've taught you.\\nYou've got this.\\n\"}],\"name\":\"Conclusion\",\"size\":15661963,\"urn\":\"urn:li:learningContentChapter:3869031\"}],\"size\":262483551,\"duration\":5719,\"zeroBased\":false}]}"
